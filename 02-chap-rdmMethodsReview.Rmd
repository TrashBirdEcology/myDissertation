## Introduction

Ecological regime shifts, or persistent changes in the underlying structure or functioning of natural systems due to exogenous forcings, are increasingly relevant in ecological research and management in an era of rapid and novel change due to to anthropogenic activity. Identifying and predicting these types of changes is especially important when they impact ecosystem services or society in any other way. Numerous quantitative methods are proposed for identifying ecological regime shifts yet there exists a disparity among the number of methods proposed and the number of studies evaluating these changes using empirical data [@hawkins2015ecosystems]. Despite the prevalence of review papers of ecological regime shift detection methods [@mac2014scrutiny; @scheffer2015generic; @rodionov_brief_2005; @roberts2018early; @dakos2015resilience; @mantua_methods_2004; @litzow_early_2016; @kefi2014early; @andersen_ecological_2009; @boettiger_early_2013; @dakos2015resilience; @kefi2014early; @yin2017methods; @ducre2003comparison; @clements2018indicators; @filatova2016regime; @deyoung_regime_2008; @roberts2018early], there does not currently exist a comprehensive and modern source for these quantitative methods. 

Existing reviews of the ecological regime shift methods vary in both the number and detail of the methods presented [@mac2014scrutiny; @scheffer2015generic; @rodionov_brief_2005; @roberts2018early; @dakos2015resilience; @mantua_methods_2004; @litzow_early_2016; @kefi2014early; @andersen_ecological_2009; @boettiger_early_2013; @dakos2015resilience; @kefi2014early; @yin2017methods; @ducre2003comparison; @clements2018indicators; @filatova2016regime; @deyoung_regime_2008; @roberts2018early]. For example, some reviews critique the current state of the regime shift literature  [e.g., @andersen_ecological_2009], while others present overviews of a large number of methods with reference to a particular system type, or methodology type [e.g., @roberts2018early]. These and other reviews provide useful syntheses of the methods, however, do not emphasize the sheer number and breadth of the methods proposed for and applied to empirical systems data. The rapid growth of this literature and the methods proposed for identifying ecological regime shifts is contributing to the lack of comprehensiveness among existing methods review papers. 

Building a comprehensive database of the proposed ecological regime shift detection methods based on a formal literature review is difficult for a few reasons. First, the terminology associated with regime shift theory and detection is highly variable within and among fields [@andersen_ecological_2009]. For example, the terms, *regime shifts, regime changes* and *tipping points* are variably used in studies of ecological systems, whereas *inhomogeneities* is common in meteorology and climatology, and *structural change* is largely confined to the study of economics. Although semantics vary both within and across disciplines some methods are shared or are concurrently applicable across fields. Second, papers introducing a new method or approach to identifying regime shifts are not often proposed in publication outlets with aims of disseminating new quantitative methods (e.g., *Ecological Modelling*, *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*). Rather, many new methods are published in journals with refined (e.g., *Entropy*, *Progress in Oceanography*), as opposed to publications with broader scopes (e.g., *Ecology* and *Nature*). 

The primary aim of this Chapter is to provide a single and comprehensive source of the quantitative methods proposed for identifying ecological regime shifts, akin to the most comprehensive method review by @rodionov_brief_2005. I also conduct a bibliographic analysis of the ecological regime shift literature to identify trends in the development and current state of ecological regime shift theory. Finally, I compile a comprehensive list of the proposed regime detection measures present in the ecological regime shift literature. 

## Methods   
This Chapter comprises two distinct components. First, I compile a comprehensive list of the regime shift detection methods and metrics used in the ecological literature based on expert knowledge and prior reviews. Second, I conduct a bibliographic analysis of the results of a formal review of the ecological regime shift literature to identify potential themes and gaps in this area.

### Quantitative methods for identifying ecological regime shifts {#revMeth1}
I used expert knowledge and previously published review papers to compile a comprehensive list of the quantitative methods proposed as ecological regime shift detection methods. A pilot study which used a systematic literature review failed to identify many of the methods of which I was previously aware, hence the reliance on expert knowledge and previously published reviews. Here, I identify the first instances of each method in the ecological or relevant literature.

The comprehensive list of methods makes exclusions for the following reasons. First, I do not include methods which largely recycle, or make only slight adaptations to, existing methods [@byrski2016double; @salehpour2011line; @zhou2008one]. However @nicholls2011biological for an addition of variable optimization to the method in @nicholls_detection_2011 that was not included in my comprehensive list. Next, the  list excludes papers which propose a combination of existing methods [e.g., @kong2017hydrological; @seddon2014quantitative; @vasilakopoulos2017resilience]. 

### Bibliographic analysis of the ecological regime shift literature {-#rsTerms2}
The still-vague definition of ecological regime shifts has led to a breadth of articles exploring this phenomenon. I conducted a formal literature review using the Web of Science database to identify patterns in the development and persistence of the ecological regime shift literature. I conduct a systematic literature review using ISI Web of Science, and use these results to conduct exploratory bibliographic analyses. The search was designed in an attempt to capture the development and breadth of the field of ecological regime shifts. I used the below-mentioned search boolean to identify articles related to regime shift and abrupt changes in ecological systems, restricting the search to the Web of Science 'categories' ('WC') *Ecology* and *Biodiversity Conservation*:  

> TS=("regime shift" OR "regime shifts" OR "regime change" OR "regime changes" OR "catastrophic change" OR "catastrophic shift" OR "catastrophic changes" OR "catastrophic shifts" OR "sudden change" OR "sudden changes" OR "abrupt shift" OR "abrupt shifts" OR "abrupt change" OR "abrupt changes") AND WC=("Ecology" OR "Biodiversity Conservation")      

```{r wosRegimePubsByJrnl, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  fig.cap = "Number of articles containing phrases related to ecological 'regime shifts' published per publication outlet."}
ggplot(wos.regime.plotData %>%
              group_by(journal) %>% 
              summarise(nJrnl = n()) %>% 
               filter(nJrnl >= 10, 
                      journal != "NA") %>% 
               arrange(nJrnl)) +
  geom_bar(aes(x =  journal, y = nJrnl), stat= "identity")+
  ylab('number of articles') + xlab("") +
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text( hjust = 1, size = 4))+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 8))
```

I identified patterns and trends in the articles resulting from the above mentioned search using a bibliographic analysis [using R Package `bibliometrix`; @bibliometrix]. This package contains function wrappers for conducting and visualizing network analyses based on keyword, authorship, and citation data. In an attempt to understand the evolution of regime shift theory and relate this evolution to the quantitative methods in the ecological literature, I focus analyses on using keyword and concept themes rather than citation counts and author dominance.
```{r wosRegimePubsByYearwithNumEcolPubs,echo=FALSE,out.width="85%", fig.cap = "Number of publications by year in fields 'Ecology' and 'Biodiversity Conservation' which included terms related to 'regime shift' (total = 654)."}

    aes(x = year, y = nRegime.pubs, color = "Regime shift"),

       x = "year",

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("chapterFiles/rdmReview/figures/figsCalledInDiss/thematicMaps-keywords.png"))
```

### Bibliographic analysis of ecological regime shift literature  
A search of Web of Science for articles in Ecology and Biodiversity Conservation containing phrases related to 'regime shifts' yielded $1,636$ original articles. These articles were not filtered in any fashion and as such all were considered in the bibliographic analysis. I used the clustering algorithms of the R package `bibliometrics` to produce thematic maps, which use clustering algorithms to identify clusters (or themes) based on bibliography features [e.g., keywords, authors ; @cobo2011approach]. 

#### Thematic mapping using keywords  
Two types of keywords exist in the ISI Web of Science bibliography metadata: those provided to the publication by the authors (author-supplied), and those defined by the ISI Web of Science (ISI-supplied). A keyword thematic map suggests these keywords are used very differently within this literature (Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps-keyword))^[Axes represent (x, Callon's centrality) the degree of interaction, or the contribution of the theme to the research field and (y, Callon's density) the strength of the network arcs, or the importance of a theme to the field. Clusters appearing in the quadrants (from top-right moving counter-clockwise) represent the following themes: I) motor-themes (important to the field and well-developed); II) basic-themes (well-developed but marginally important to the field); III) emerging and disappearing themes (under-developed and marginal); and IV) specialized themes (important but under-developed). These themes were identified using a clustering algorithm discussed further in @cobo2011approach]. The clustering algorithm identified fewer clusters (themes) in the ISI-keywords (Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps-keyword)a) than were identified among the author-supplied keywords (Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps-keyword)b^; see footnote $^2$). This pattern is not surprising given the ISI-supplied keywords are restricted to a pre-set number of keywords, whereas authors can and do provide synonyms, or words not used at all by ISI. The themes identified in the ISI-supplied keyword analysis were relatively consistent as the number of keywords analysed increased, but the themes varied drastically among the author-supplied keywords. For this reason I make inference on only the ISI-supplied keyword cluster analysis. 
```{r thematicMaps-keyword-author, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The themes identified in the literatue based on author-supplied keywords vary as the number of words included in the analysis increased.", out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("chapterFiles/rdmReview/figures/figsCalledInDiss/thematicMaps-keywords-nVaries-author.png"))
```

```{r thematicMaps-keyword-isi, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The themes identified in the literatue based on the ISI-supplied keywords vary as the number of words included in the analysis increased.", out.width="85%"}
## Currently these are not being run nor called from file.
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("chapterFiles/rdmReview/figures/figsCalledInDiss/thematicMaps-keywords-nVaries-isi.png"))
```

```{r historiograph, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Chronological direct citation newtwork suggests the intellectual structure can be mapped to a few papers. This historiograph identifies important works explicitly in chronological, as opposed to absolute, order.", out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("chapterFiles/rdmReview/figures/figsCalledInDiss/historiograph-75quantile.png"))
```

```{r totArtCitesPerYear, echo=FALSE,out.width="85%",  fig.cap="Total number of articles published and corresponding number of citations (for papers published that year). The most highly cited papers to-date are those published in the late 2000s."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("chapterFiles/rdmReview/figures/figsCalledInDiss/totArtCitesPerYear.png"))
```

```{r revArtNums,echo=FALSE,out.width="85%", fig.cap="Total number of articles published per year by category as categorized by ISI. Book chapters, proceedings, editorials, and letters are excluded."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("chapterFiles/rdmReview/figures/figsCalledInDiss/revArtNums.png"))
```


Four major themes were identified in the ISI keyword analysis and, interestingly, fell mostly within the quadrants representing the most extreme values: the first and the third quadrants (Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps-keyword-isi)). The themes identified by the ISI-supplied keywords were much larger in scope (e.g, dynamics, ecosystems, climate; Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps-keyword)a) than those identified in the analysis of author-supplied keywords (e.g., eutrophication, trophic cascade; Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps-keyword)b). That is, the themes of 'regime shifts' and 'ecosystem dynamics' are highly central to and dense within the regime shift literature (Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps-keyword)b-d). This suggests these two themes are important to the development of the field and are still strongly influencing the evolution of this field. Although the theme 'dynamics' appears a central theme in the development and persistence in ecological regime shift theory based on the bibliographic analysis, it is not necessarily reflected in the many case studies of regime shifts in application [@litzow_early_2016]. In fact, @litzow_early_2016 found that $\sim50%$ of case studies actually tested or accounted for non-linear dynamics when applying  early warning indicators and other regime shift measures to ecological time series. 

#### Historiograph, citation, and reviews
A few patterns appear in analyses of the intellectual and chronological structure of the ecological regime shift literature (Figure \@ref(fig:historiograph)). First, although the concept of stability, thresholds, and multiple stable states in ecological systems first appeared (and was well-received) in the literature in the 1970s [e.g., @holling1973resilience; @may1977thresholds], the most highly cited papers in this field appeared primarily in the early and mid 2000s [@scheffer2003catastrophic; @carpenter2006rising; @folke2004regime; @walker2004resilience; @van2005implications]. The most recent major contributions to the field were conceptual works emphasizing planetary boundaries and tipping points and the impacts of not recognizing these shifts [@hughes2013multiscale]. Finally, the "rise" of resilience theory [@folke2004regime; @walker2004resilience], the first efforts of a search for early warning indicators of ecological regime shifts [@carpenter2006rising]  and the critiques soon following these efforts [@andersen_ecological_2009; @contamin_indicators_2009] are highlighted in the historiograph.

The most influential papers in the field, based solely on number of citations, are those published in the late 2000s (Figure\@ref(fig:totArtCitesPerYear)), and include the articles which are broad in-scope and are still used today to frame studies in the context of global change, planetary boundaries, and large-scale tipping points [@rockstrom_planetary_2009; @smith2009eutrophication; @bennett2009understanding]. Around this time ($\sim2007$) is when the number of regime detection measures doubled (Figure \@ref(fig:wosRegimePubsByYearwithNumEcolPubs)). Papers equally influential to the development of this field include those corresponding to the observed rapid increase in the number of total publications in ecological regime shift theory (in the early 2000s), @folke2004regime and @scheffer2003catastrophic (Figure\@ref(fig:totArtCitesPerYear)). 

Numerous reviews of the regime shift literature exist, ranging from conceptual reviews of the state of regime shift theory in ecology and application [e.g., @bestelmeyer_analysis_2011; @mac2014scrutiny; @andersen_ecological_2009], to studies of robustness of early warning indicators under various theoretical and practical conditions [e.g., @dutta2018robustness; @perretti2012regime; @lindegren_early_2012; @hastings2010regime; Figure \@ref(fig:revArtNums)]. Further, comprehensive reviews of the ecological regime shift detection literature are increasingly out-dated. A permanent and open-source database containing information critical to the testing, comparison, and implementation of RDMs may prove useful to the reader who is interested in applying RDMs but is lacking the statistical or mathematical background to do so.

## A synthesis of the methods available for the practical ecologist
Many of the methods identified in this review have yet to be tested on empirical data from more than a single system type (see Table \@ref(tab:methodstable)).  I categorize the regime detection methods as one of either model-free or model-dependent. Model-free and model-dependent methods are those which do and do not require a mechanistic model to describe the system, respectively. Because many of the model-dependent methods are based on auto-regressive modelling approaches, this is highlighted in the model-dependent section. 

The early warning indicators that are often referred to as, "traditional early warning indicators" (variance, skewness, autocorrelation at lag-1) are fairly well-reviewed, and have been applied to  a variety of conditions [@dakos2012methods; @ditlevsen2010tipping; @lindegren_early_2012; @boettiger_quantifying_2012; @sommer2017generic; @perretti2012regime; @dutta2018robustness; @litzow_early_2016]. However, many of these works apply the traditional (and other) early warning indicators to simulated data, with only some [@contamin_indicators_2009; @perretti2012regime; @dutta2018robustness; @guttal2013robustness] testing under varying conditions of noise and expected shift types. The utility and robustness of the traditional early warning indicators is not consistent across and within systems, making them of limited utility in situations where the system cannot be reliably mathematically modelled, or where we have limited data [@burthe2016early; @hastings2010regime; @perretti2012regime; see also Chapter \@ref(resampling)]. Critical reviews and comparative studies of early warning indicators suggest that no early warning indicator is reliable alone, suggesting the user apply a suite, rather than a single method, and  that there remain gaps in our understanding of the conditions under which  an early warning indicators might fail [@kefi2014early; @clements2018indicators;  @filatova2016regime; @deyoung_regime_2008].

Regime detection measures can be classified into one of two major groups which will largely dictate the applicability of an approach to an analyst or type of information. Some RDMs require the use of mechanistic models whereas others fall into the category of model-independent (or model-free). In most situations, the practical ecologist will have insufficient data or a limited understanding of the system with which to parameterize even the simplest mechanistic models. Further, developing an informative defining data-generating model (i.e. system of equations, differential equations) for more than a few variables (i.e. much greater than 2) is often intractable. Following the convention of @dakos2012methods, I classify the 66 regime detection measure identified as a result of this review for detecting as one of model-based or model(metric)-free and generally synthesize the utility of these types of measures to the practical ecologist. 

### Model-dependent
Model-dependent require a mechanistic (mathematical) representation of the system, models which often carry strict assumptions that are easily violated by empirical systems [@abadi2010assessment]. Model-dependent methods are usefully categorized under two contexts: differentiable systems of equations or auto-regressive. The methods relying on mechanistic models include model descriptions of systems with many, dynamic and interacting components. For example, models are used to reconstruct trophic food webs where prey or predator collapse induces trophic regime shifts in freshwater lake systems [@carpenter2011early]. 

### Model-free
Model-free [or metric-based per @dakos2012methods] methods are those which do not require a mathematical representation of the system. In fact, many require much less knowledge about the system component dynamics and their interactions to calculate a results. The utility of these methods vary with respect to the number of state variables encompassed in the method, and are therefore further categorized as either univariate (using a single dimension) or multivariate (using but not necessarily requiring multiple dimensions). The most widely used model-free univariate RDMs include descriptive statistics of individual system components (i.e. univariate), such as variance, skewness, and mean value [@mantua_methods_2004; @rodionov_application_2005; @andersen_ecological_2009]. These univariate methods, often referred to as 'traditional early-warning indicators' require only very simple calculations of individual variables, however, their efficacy in empirical systems analysis is controversial. For example, variance [@carpenter2006rising] and skewness (of a single variable), oft referred to generally as 'leading indicators' or 'early-warning indicators' in the literature, have been applied to both theoretical and empirical systems data with varying results. 

## Discussion 
In this chapter I present a comprehensive list of the regime detection measures proposed for analyzing ecological data. Although multiple reviews of regime detection measures exist, they are either not comprehensive in their survey of the possible methods or are increasingly out of date with respect to the number of methods proposed in the literature [@rodionov_brief_2005]. Most reviews since the comprehensive list presented in @rodionov_brief_2005 are not comprehensive, instead focusing on a single aspect of measures that may be useful to a particular audience. For example, @roberts2018early summarizes methods capable of handling multiple variables, and @dakos2015resilience review only methods designed to detect the phenomenon of critical slowing down. The list presented here does not discriminate, and provides an update to the seminal methods paper by @rodionov_brief_2005. It is important to note that contributions of previous reviews to the understand and scrutiny of regime detection measures in ecology: @mac2014scrutiny; @scheffer2015generic; @rodionov_brief_2005; @roberts2018early; @dakos2015resilience; @mantua_methods_2004; @litzow_early_2016; @kefi2014early; @andersen_ecological_2009; @boettiger_early_2013; @dakos2015resilience; @clements2018indicators; @filatova2016regime; @deyoung_regime_2008. 

Leading indicators/regime detection measures which analyze only single variables (e.g., variance, autocorrelation at lag-1) are well-tested on both theoretical and empirical data [e.g. @burthe2016early]. Among the most widely used RDMs indicators applied to time-series data include an index of variance, moments around the grand mean (skewness and kurtosis), and critical slowing down [@carpenterBrock2011early; @carpenter2006rising]. Although univariate indicators may provide insight into relatively simple systems, their reliability as indicators for complex systems is less certain [@burthe2016early; @dutta2018robustness; @perretti2012regime; @sommer2017generic; @bestelmeyer_analysis_2011]. Leading indicators can be a reliable warning of impending shift [@carpenterBrock2011early]. Some methods have been applied to early-warning indicators in whole systems [@carpenter2011early], however, it is uncommon to have enough information to build reliable networks or food webs. Consequently, reliably measuring the ecological system at hand is often realistically (and financially) not possible. To be useful to practitioners it may be necessary to move beyond heuristic methods, to methods which supply statistical significance or probabilities. And although critiques of some RDMs exist, the rate at which they are rigorously tested does not exceed the proliferation of new methods in the literature. For any method to gain credible traction as a pragmatic tool in ecology, studies should address the concerns of these critiques.

Only a handful of methods have been introduced to the mainstream methodological journals in ecology (e.g., *Ecological Modelling*, *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*). Although many mainstream publications (e.g., *Science*, *Ecology Letters*) include applications of some of the methods identified in this chapter (Table \@ref(tab:methodstable)), I argue that celebrity and 'new and shiny' [@steel2013applied] methods may influence which methodological articles are printed in these popular journals.  A critical survey of potential and realized applications of these methods would be useful for highlighting the needs of future research and methodological improvements. Many of the methods presented in Table \@ref(tab:methodstable) have either not been applied to empirical data at all, or were tested only once, often but not always in the article introducing or adapting the methodology [@hawkins2015ecosystems]. Some methods, especially those dubbed 'early warning indicators' (variance, auto-regressive model coefficients) have become relatively mainstream in their application to empirical data, despite having been shown to be less robust in noisy and nonlinear systems [@burthe2016early], in systems exhibiting lag-effects [@guttal2013robustness], and in systems not exhibiting catastrophic shifts [@dutta2018robustness]. Unlike these early warning indicators, fewer efforts have been made to test robustness under these and more simple conditions [@dutta2018robustness; c.f. @brock2010interacting; @benedetti2015experimental]. In addition to the paucity of studies attempting to understand the limitations of these methods, this review suggests that simply identifying the suite of methods used in ecological regime shift detection may be difficult using traditional review methods.  Many of the methods mentioned in this review were not easily identifiable in a pilot, systematic search process in Web of Science and Google Scholar--rather, many methods were those of which I was either previously aware and/or those previously  highlighted in the existing reviews [@scheffer2015generic; @rodionov_brief_2005; @roberts2018early; @dakos2015resilience; @mantua_methods_2004; @litzow_early_2016; @kefi2014early; @andersen_ecological_2009; @boettiger_early_2013; @dakos2015resilience; @clements2018indicators; @filatova2016regime; @deyoung_regime_2008]. To facilitate this process, an online, comprehensive database may prove useful to the practical ecologist. 

@hastings2010regime aptly point out an important feature of using any methods for identifying regime shifts in empirical system data: first,  only have a single history exists for ecological system trajectories and second,  most early warning indicators which signal critical slowing down require the system to have a small potential. Although both points are equally important, the latter infers that no ecological system that is complex, or which cannot be accurately modelled using a system of continuous equations, will be predictable via current, early warning signals.  This, paired with the failure of early warning signals in some systems gives little hope for relying upon most regime detection measures and early warning signals as indicators of ecological regime shifts. Disregarding stochasticity in ecological models will often make the model non-differentiable at the point of an abrupt shift [@hastings2010regime; @graham1984existence]. 

The warnings by @hastings2010regime have not yet been heeded---regime detection measures are still being introduced into the literature, often assuming that the system will exhibit critical slowing down prior to the shift, or having been tested on only a single trajectory of an ecological system. Given the increase in introduction and application of regime detection measures, I recommend the following practices be used in this field will aid the accessibility  and transparency of the methods: consistent use of fewer methods which require fewer assumptions; persistent collection and maintenance of baseline data (reference data); an open-sourced database of methods and applications; an updated and critical review of the current state of methods in ecology (see Chapter \@ref(resampling)) which includes a brief discussion of the methodological advancements and demonstrated failures; rigorous empirical applications of these methods (especially of those only tested on toy and experimental data); and the relationship of the RDMs used in ecology to other fields (computer science, data science, climatology and oceanography). I identify a suite of questions (Table \@ref(tab:nextStepsTab)) that would be useful in a much-needed modern and critical review of this field.


```{r nextStepsTab, echo=FALSE}
Questions.stat <- c(
  "Does the method assume smooth potential?",
  "Does the regime shift need to be identified *a priori*?",
  "What are the major assumptions about the distribution of the original data?",
  "Does the method explicitly assume the system/variable is stationary?", 
  "Does the performance of the method change with non-stationarity?",
  "Can the method handle unstructured data?",
  "Can the method handle multiple regime shifts?",
  "What types of regime shifts can the method detect (e.g., stochastic resonance, slow-fast cycles, noise-induced transition)?",
  "Is it a model- or metric-based method?", 
  "Does it have forecasting potential?",
  "Can the method handle uneven sampling?",
  "What are the minimum data requirements (resolution, extent, number of observations)?",
  "How does the method handle missing data (e.g., new invasions)?", 
  "Does the method assume Eulerian or Lagrangian processes?")

Questions.ecol <- c(
  "Does the system *have* smooth potential?",
  "Has the method been tested on empirical data? If so, to what rigor?",
  "What is the impact of losing state variables on long-term predictions (e.g., species extinction)?",
  "Can the method identify drivers?",
  "What assumptions does the method make about the system?", 
  "What types of regime shifts are possible in the system?", 
  "Are regime shift(s) suspected *a priori*?",
  "What lag(s) exist in the data (system)?",
  "Would a positive forecast change management action?",
  "Do predictions translate to other systems?",
  "Can we interpolate data if necessary? If so, what does this mean for inference?",
  "In which discipline(s) beyond ecology has the method been tested?"
  )
