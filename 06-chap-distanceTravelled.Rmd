## Introduction

Defining a regime shift 

There are different types fo regime shifts, and **why those differences matter**  

  * only ???regime shifts??? that are also ???critical transitions??? should show ???critical slowing down???  
    - so that???s an important *technical distinction* if you???re trying to use *???early warning signals???*.   
  * There are mutiple types og **critical transitions**  
    - these results in very different changes in time series  
    - in some contexts, this doesn't really matter
