# Table of Definitions {-#definitions}
Research surrounding regime shifts, threshold identification, change-point detection, bifurcation theory, etc. is muddled with jargon. Here, I provide a table of definitions (Table \@ref(tab:glossary)) for terms and concepts that may either be unfamiliar to the practical ecologist, or may have multiple meanings among and within ecological researchers and practitioners. With this table, I aim to both improve the clarity of this dissertation *and* highlight one potential issue associated with regime detection methods in ecology: semantics.

```{r glossary, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message=F, warning=F}
# Create a table of definitions 
require(kableExtra)
require(tidyverse)
glossary <- read.csv("./chapterFiles/glossary.csv") %>%
  arrange(Term) %>% 
  filter(readyToUse==T) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(Term = tools::toTitleCase(as.character(Term)))

eor <- seq(2,nrow(glossary), 2)# every other row

kable(glossary %>% dplyr::select(Term, Definition, Synonyms), format = "latex", booktabs = T,longtable=T, 
      caption = "A table of definitions for terms, theories, and phrases often appearing in ecological regime shift literature.") %>%
kable_styling("striped", full_width = F, font_size = 10, 
              latex_options = c("repeat_header")
              ) %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold=T) %>% 
  column_spec(1, width = "8em") %>% 
  column_spec(2, width = "25em") %>% 
  column_spec(3, width = "6em") %>% 
  row_spec(row = eor, bold =T)
```
