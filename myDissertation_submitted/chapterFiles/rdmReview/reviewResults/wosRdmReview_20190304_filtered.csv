G.",Early warning signals in plant disease outbreaks,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,2019,393,NA,1-Feb,n,"Infectious disease outbreaks in plants threaten ecosystems, agricultural crops and food trade. Currently, several fungal diseases are affecting forests worldwide, posing a major risk to tree species, habitats and consequently ecosystem decay. Prediction and control of disease spread are difficult, mainly due to the complexity of the interaction between individual components involved. In this work, we introduce a lattice-based epidemic model coupled with a stochastic process that mimics, in a very simplified way, the interaction between the hosts and pathogen. We studied the disease spread by measuring the propagation velocity of the pathogen on the susceptible hosts. Our quantitative results indicate the occurrence of a critical transition between two stable phases: local confinement and an extended epiphytotic outbreak that depends on the density of the susceptible individuals. Quantitative predictions of epiphytotics are performed using the framework early-warning indicators for impending regime shifts, widely applied on dynamical systems. These signals forecast successfully the outcome of the critical shift between the two stable phases before the system enters the epiphytotic regime. Our study demonstrates that early-warning indicators could be useful for the prediction of forest disease epidemics through mathematical and computational models suited to more specific pathogen-host-environmental interactions. Our results may also be useful to identify a suitable planting density to slow down disease spread and in the future, design highly resilient forests.",10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.11.003,NA,0304-3800,1872-7026,ISI:000458223000002,19-Dec,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The identification of these threshold loads is an important step in the sustainable management of nutrient discharges. In this study, a novel methodological approach is presented to simulate the spatial and temporal dynamics of coastal nitrogen loads and its relationship with seagrass loss. The analysis allows the identification of nitrogen thresholds associated with the loss of Posidonia and Amphibolis spp. in Adelaide, South Australia. The identified thresholds varied between 0.8 and 1.1 t N km(-2) over 6 months and explained up to 95\% of all seagrass losses in the region. Posidonia spp. was predominantly lost nearshore, indicating a threshold for this species in the higher end of the values reported here. In contrast, Amphibolis spp. were selectively lost further offshore, suggesting a lower threshold for the onset of fragmentation and decline. Nitrogen pressure was concentrated over the wetter months of the year between late autumn and early spring. Pulsed pressure peaking in August likely affected thresholds by reducing resilience in the system. Synthesis and applications. This study derives, for the first time, nitrogen load thresholds for the loss of the seagrasses Posidonia and Amphibolis spp., highlighting the low tolerance of these keystone temperate species to nitrogen pressure.

C.",Improving tropical deforestation detection through using photosynthetic vegetation time series - (PVts-beta),ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,2018,94,1,NOV,n,"This paper proposes a new approach of change detection that reduces seasonality in time series by using Photosynthetic Vegetation Time Series (PVTS) from satellite images. With this approach, each pixel value represents at the subpixel level a fraction of the photosynthetic forest's activity. Our hypothesis is based on an assumption that photosynthetic vegetation fractions will remain constant until a disturbing agent (natural or anthropic) occurs. Using Landsat data, we compared our approach with the Carnegie Landsat Systems Analysis-Lite (CLASlite) approach and with the national reports of the Ministry of the Environment of Peru (MINAM). After reducing seasonal variations in Landsat data, we detected deforestation events with a new detection method. Our approach (which was called PVts-beta) of detection is a simple method that does not model the seasonality and it only requires as inputs: i) the average and standard deviation of the time series of a pixel and ii) a threshold magnitude (beta) that was calibrated to detect deforestation events in tropical forests. For the PVts-beta approach, the results of calibration show that deforestation was optimally detected for beta = (5,6), higher or lower than this range, the biases favor to false detections and favor the omission of deforestation too. On the other hand, the overall accuracy for the PVts-beta approach was 91.1\%, with an omission and commission of 8.3\% and 0.5\% respectively, while for CLASlite the overall accuracy was 79.2\%, with an omission and commission of 20.8\% and 0.0\% respectively. The differences in the overall accuracy between the PVts-beta and CLASlite approach were significant, being atmospheric noise a main problem which CLASlite usually does not work optimally. The strength of our PVts-beta approach is the early detection at the subpixel level of deforestation events that, added to our new method of change detection explain the little omission obtained in the results. Therefore, the PVts-beta approach-that we propose here- provides the opportunity to monitoring deforestation events in tropical forests at sub-annual scales using Landsat data, and it can be used for near-real-time change detection monitoring without a doubt.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.07.012,NA,1470-160X,1872-7034,ISI:000452692500038,367-379,"Pereira, Alcides/0000-0002-7392-2255","Pereira, Alcides/M-5900-2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent advances in biologging have resulted in animal location data at unprecedentedly high temporal resolutions, sometimes many times per second. However, many current methods for analysing animal movement (e.g. step selection analysis or state-space modelling) were developed with lower-resolution data in mind. To make such methods usable with high-resolution data, we require techniques to identify features within the trajectory where movement deviates from a straight line. 2. We propose that the intricacies of movement paths, and particularly turns, reflect decisions made by animals so that turn points are particularly relevant to behavioural ecologists. As such, we introduce a fast, accurate algorithm for inferring turning-points in high-resolution data. For analysing big data, speed and scalability are vitally important. We test our algorithm on simulated data, where varying amounts of noise were added to paths of straight-line segments interspersed with turns. We also demonstrate our algorithm on data of free-ranging oryx Oryx leucoryx. We compare our algorithm to existing statistical techniques for break-point inference. 3. The algorithm scales linearly and can analyse several hundred-thousand data points in a few seconds on a mid-range desktop computer. It identified turnpoints in simulated data with complete accuracy when the noise in the headings had a standard deviation of +/- 8 degrees, well within the tolerance of many modern biologgers. It has comparable accuracy to the existing algorithms tested, and is up to three orders of magnitude faster. 4. Our algorithm, freely available in R and Python, serves as an initial step in processing ultra high-resolution animal movement data, resulting in a rarefied path that can be used as an input into many existing step-and-turn methods of analysis. The resulting path consists of points where the animal makes a clear turn, and thereby provides valuable data on decisions underlying movement patterns. As such, it provides an important breakthrough required as a starting point for analysing subsecond resolution data.",10.1111/2041-210X.13056,NA,2041-210X,2041-2096,ISI:000446328200005,2091-2101,"Borger, Luca/0000-0001-8763-5997 Alagaili, Abdulaziz/0000-0002-9733-4220 Potts, Jonathan/0000-0002-8564-2904","Borger, Luca/C-6003-2008 ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The most pervasive processes of degradation include habitat loss and fragmentation. However, a recovery of modified landscape is occurring in some areas. Objectives The main goal is to know how lichen and bryophyte epiphytic richness growing on Mediterranean forests is influenced not only by fragments characteristics but also by the structure of the landscape. We introduce a temporal dimension in order to evaluate if the historical landscape structure is relevant for current epiphytic communities. Methods 40 well-preserved forest fragments were selected in a landscape with a large habitat loss over decades, but with a recovery of forest surface in the last 55years. The most relevant fragment and landscape-scale attributes were considered. Some of the variables were measured in three different years to incorporate a temporal framework. Results The results showed that variables at fragment scale had a higher influence, whereas variables at the landscape scale were irrelevant. Among all the historical variables analyzed, only the shift in forest fragment size had influence on species richness. Conclusions Mediterranean forests had suffered fragmentation along centuries. Their epiphytic communities also suffer the hard conditions of Mediterranean climate.

However, counting mosquitoes is beyond the realms of possibility. A plausible method is to monitor the infection frequency. We propose the concept of Wolbachia enhancing domain in which the infection frequency keeps increasing. A detailed description of the domain is presented.

Different model setup and data input however can lead to variable model predictions. Existing studies on quantifying SDM dissimilarity primarily rely on partitioning the variability in SDM-produced community level metrics such as species richness and turnover rate which are threshold-dependent and are generated with binary range maps of multiple species. Most existing measurements of spatial dissimilarity constitute geometric comparisons, which is limited compared to a more information-theoretic application of statistical dissimilarity measures using SDM predictions as direct input without renormalization. We introduce a novel method to quantify the degree of dissimilarity and its level of significance between unscaled SDM predictions of a single species. We apply the method to giant panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca data as well as pairs of simulated species distributions. We utilize a pixel-based Bhattacharyya distance to quantify the degree of dissimilarity among predictions of giant panda habitat of different combinations of model types, Global Climate Models (GCMs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Comparisons are also made between pairs of simulated species with different degrees of dissimilarity in spatial distribution. To evaluate the level of significance, the observed dissimilarity measure is compared against a null distribution that captures the level of dissimilarity caused by small and random variations. Specific pairs of climate scenarios (HadGEM2-ES with HadGEM2-AO and HadGEM2-AO with MIROC5) consistently produce statistically similar predictions of giant panda habitat; the highest level of RCP tends to result in more similar predictions, suggesting a convergence of model predictions. The simulated scenarios also show that the proposed method is able to effectively differentiate a range of artificial species with varying degree of dissimilarity in their resource selection preference. Our method can also reflect the dissimilarity that cannot be quantified by traditional metrics that rely on geometric comparisons. The proposed method supplements existing studies by utilizing a novel application of statistical comparisons to measure dissimilarity between user-defined pairs of models. It provides a robust way to construct the null distribution of dissimilarity that contrasts the degree of the observed dissimilarity with the intrinsic model variability. Our study provides useful insight to facilitate building more computationally efficient and robust ensemble SDMs, and it lends a practical tool to help understand the processes that contribute to prediction variability among SDMs.",10.1016/j.ecoinf.2018.06.004,NA,1574-9541,1878-0512,ISI:000440957500011,114-124,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most previous work on the Signor-Lipps effect has focused on testing whether taxa in a mass extinction went extinct simultaneously or gradually. However, many authors have proposed scenarios in which taxa went extinct in distinct pulses. Little methodology has been developed for quantifying characteristics of such pulsed extinction events. Here we introduce a method for estimating the number of pulses in a mass extinction, based on the positions of fossil occurrences in a stratigraphic section. Rather than using a hypothesis test and assuming simultaneous extinction as the default, we reframe the question by asking what number of pulses best explains the observed fossil record. Using a two-step algorithm, we are able to estimate not just the number of extinction pulses but also a confidence level or posterior probability for each possible number of pulses. In the first step, we find the maximum likelihood estimate for each possible number of pulses. In the second step, we calculate the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion weights for each possible number of pulses, and then apply a k-nearest neighbor classifier to these weights. This method gives us a vector of confidence levels for the number of extinction pulses-for instance, we might be 80\% confident that there was a single extinction pulse, 15\% confident that there were two pulses, and 5\% confident that there were three pulses. Equivalently, we can state that we are 95\% confident that the number of extinction pulses is one or two. Using simulation studies, we show that the method performs well in a variety of situations, although it has difficulty in the case of decreasing fossil recovery potential, and it is most effective for small numbers of pulses unless the sample size is large. We demonstrate the method using a data set of Late Cretaceous ammonites.",10.1017/pab.2016.30,NA,0094-8373,1938-5331,ISI:000431785600002,199-218,"Wang, Steve/0000-0002-8953-285X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To assess watershed health and develop effective management plans, information about the function and structure of the watersheds in the context of their climatic response, especially to take into account rainfall anomalies and climate change adaptation, is needed. Integration of climatic variables with reliability, resilience and vulnerability (RRV) indicators, is a novel approach for generating this information. This study investigated the behavior of RRV indicators with respect to rainfall variability and drought patterns for three watersheds governed by different climates. Reliability was defined as the probability of a watershed to be in the range of satisfactory Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values. Resilience was indicated as the speed of recovery from an unsatisfactory condition. Vulnerability was defined as a function of the exposure of a watershed to climate change and variation using the SPI. The study areas were the Foyle Watershed in Northern Ireland (temperate oceanic, Cfb), the Xarrama Watershed in Portugal (Mediterranean hot summer, Csa) and the Shazand Watershed in Iran (moderate to cold semi-arid (Bsk). Based on the SPI pattern of each watershed, the SPI of -0.1 for the Foyle and Xarrama watersheds and +0.1 for the Shazand Watershed was selected as the drought threshold. The drought based RRV index was subsequently calculated from long-term (1981-2012) RRV indicators, resulting in means of 0.52 +/- 0.25, 0.53 +/- 0.21 and 0.30 +/- 0.18 for the three watersheds, respectively. These means reflect the status of the watersheds in terms of climatic conditions, which was moderate dry (0.41-0.60) for the Foyle and Xarrama watersheds and dry (0.21-0.40) for the Shazand Watershed. The temporal trend of the drought based RRV index was found to be non-significantly increasing (P-value > 0.52) for the Foyle and Xarrama watersheds and non-significantly decreasing for the Shazand Watershed (P-value > 0.48). The vulnerability indicator and drought based RRV index were significantly (p-value = 0.00) affected by the climatological gradient.

Patrick",Tracking restoration of population diversity via the portfolio effect,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2018,55,2,MAR,n,"1. Declines in diversity among populations managed together have diminished aggregate stability through a decreased portfolio effect. Although the portfolio effect has been quantified in a variety of ways, management recommendations for the recovery of lost diversity rarely specify the stability benefits possible through such improvements. 2. We introduce a metric, the Diversity Deficit (DD), that relates past losses and potential gains in aggregate stability to the changes in population diversity (i.e. covariability among population time series). We illustrate the use of this metric in retrospective analyses of the aggregate Sacramento River Fall-run Chinook salmon stock (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and project potential future improvements in stability through population diversity. 3. In the retrospective analysis, we removed individual time series from the stability calculations to determine their effects on times and locations of past losses in diversity and stability. We found an early threefold loss in stock stability resulting from the presence of a single tributary, the Sacramento River mainstem. Other shifts in stability resulted from an increase in variability of a single population, and from the synchronizing effects of low ocean survival that led to the 2008-2009 fishery closure. Only one, smaller increase in the DD (i.e. in lost stability) was due to portfolio-wide increases in covariabilities among tributary abundances. 4. In a prospective analysis using the DD applied to California salmon, we found that increasing biodiversity to the point of population independence and to its early high value would have reduced the probability of triggering a fishery closure. 5. Synthesis and applications. Analyses with the Diversity Deficit (DD) metric illustrate a way to identify the times and locations of losses in population diversity, and to quantify how much restoration of population diversity could increase stability, and thus benefit resource services.

However, since more spread data become available as an outbreak unfolds, processes underpinning pathogen transmission can almost always be characterised more precisely later in epidemics. This allows the future progression of any outbreak to be forecast more accurately, and so enables control interventions to be targeted more precisely. There is also the chance that the outbreak might die out without any intervention whatsoever, making prophylactic control unnecessary. Optimal decision-making involves continuously balancing these potential benefits of waiting against the possible costs of further spread. We introduce a generic, extensible data-driven algorithm based on parameter estimation and outbreak simulation for making decisions in real-time concerning when and how to control an invading pathogen. The Control Smart Algorithm (CSA) resolves the trade-off between the competing advantages of controlling as soon as possible and controlling later when more information has become available. We show-using a generic mathematical model representing the transmission of a pathogen of agricultural animals or plants through a population of farms or fields-how the CSA allows the timing and level of deployment of vaccination or chemical control to be optimised. In particular, the algorithm outperforms simpler strategies such as intervening when the outbreak size reaches a pre-specified threshold, or controlling when the outbreak has persisted for a threshold length of time. This remains the case even if the simpler methods are fully optimised in advance. Our work highlights the potential benefits of giving careful consideration to the question of when to start disease management during emerging outbreaks, and provides a concrete framework to allow policy-makers to make this decision.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006014,e1006014,1553-734X,1553-7358,ISI:000427427300046,NA,"Thompson, Robin/0000-0001-8545-5212",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) surveys with two independent observers are widely used to estimate wildlife population abundance. The analysis relies on accurate identification of duplicate sightings common to both observers, and correct judgements of group size, both of which are hard to achieve for species that exhibit complex grouping patterns. 2. In this paper, we examine the impact of these sources of uncertainty on bias and precision of abundance estimates, using a case study of 22 aerial surveys of common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand. We develop a novel probabilistic method to identify duplicate observations, and account for various sources of uncertainty using a simulation-intensive approach. 3. For our case study, identifying duplicates using reasonable but arbitrary thresholds of time and angle discrepancies created a range of abundance estimates differing by up to 20\%, whereas our novel threshold-free probabilistic analysis returned an estimate roughly central to this range. Uncertainty in group size made a smaller impact of up to 5\% on abundance estimates. All analysis choices returned similar values for the coefficient of variation, from 20 to 23\%. 4. Generating robust estimates of abundance, and accounting for all associated sources of uncertainty, is critical for informing conservation management. Our novel approach provides a way to eliminate arbitrary decisions associated with MRDS, and account for a wider range of uncertainties.

Values define and bind groups, organizations, and societies; serve an adaptive role; and are typically stable across generations. When abrupt value changes occur, they are in response to substantial alterations in the social-ecological context. Such changes build on prior value structures and do not result in complete replacement. Given this understanding of values, we conclude that deliberate efforts to orchestrate value shifts for conservation are unlikely to be effective. Instead, there is an urgent need for research on values with a multilevel and dynamic view that can inform innovative conservation strategies for working within existing value structures.

However, it is difficult to apply the DNB theory to clinical practice because evaluating DNB at the critical state required the data of multiple samples on each individual, which are generally not available, and thus limit the applicability of DNB. In this study, we developed a novel method, i.e., single-sample DNB (sDNB), to detect early-warning signals or critical states of diseases in individual patients with only a single sample for each patient, thus opening a new way to predict diseases in a personalized way.

Some HIT models assume that the thermoinhibition of germination is caused by an upward shift in base water potential psi(b(g)) that only happens above the optimum temperature To, and that To is a parameter independent of the water stress level. However, the available data suggest that these assumptions may be invalid in practice. We introduce a new HIT model that uses a log logistic distribution for psi(b(g))and assumes a linear increase in psi(b(g)) across both sub-and supra-optimal temperature ranges. We also provide explicit mathematical solutions for estimating To and other cardinal temperatures within a HTT modelling framework. Germination data were obtained for two winter annual plant species (Hordeum spontaneum and Phalaris minor) and used to build and test the model. For both species, the linear upward shift in psi(b(g))) was confirmed across both sub-and supra-optimal ranges, while the hydrotime constant theta(H) decreased nonlinearly with temperature. This interplay between OH and psi(b(g)) resulted in a curvilinear germination rate response to temperature that accounts for thermoinhibition of germination at high temperatures. The optimal temperature decreased proportionally with decreasing water potential and became cooler for higher (slower) germination fractions than for the lower (faster) ones. The new modelling approach not only gave good fits to germination data (with root mean square errors <10\%), but also provided useful insights about the adaptive strategies evolved by plant species to optimize their germination timing under the various temperature and moisture environments.

BACIPS is a powerful tool to derive inferences about interventions when classic experimental approaches (e.g. which rely on spatial replicates and random assignment of treatments) are not feasible or desirable. Previously applied BACIPS designs generally assume that effects are sudden, constant and long-lived: that is, that systems exhibit step-changes' in response to interventions. However, complex ecological interactions or gradual interventions may create delayed and/or progressive responses, potentially impeding the reliability of classic (step-change) analyses. We propose a novel approach, the Progressive-Change BACIPS, which generalizes and expands the scope of BACIPS analyses. We evaluate the relative performance of this approach using both simulated and real data that exhibit step-change, linear, asymptotic and sigmoid responses following an intervention. We quantify the statistical power and accuracy of the Progressive-Change BACIPS under varying initial population densities, intensity of spatial sampling, effect sizes and number of sampling dates After the intervention. We show that Progressive-Change BACIPS identified the correct model among the set of candidate models under most conditions and led to accurate estimates of the parameters that were used to generate the simulated data. When data were sparse, and the dynamics complex, simpler (more parsimonious) models were favoured over the more complex models that actually generated the simulated data. Application of the Progressive-Change BACIPS to existing data sets from the literature led to strong support for specific models (over alternatives) and led to more specific inferences than possible under the classic BACIPS approach. The Progressive-Change BACIPS proposed here is more flexible than the original BACIPS formulation because the data are used to inform the form of the final model, rather than having the form of the model imposed on the data. This leads to better estimates of the effects of environmental impacts and the time-scales over which they operate. As a result, the Progressive-Change BACIPS should be applicable to a wide range of studies and should help improve investigation of time-dependent effects.

Prx superfamily members are widespread across phylogeny and multiple methods have been developed to classify them. Here we present an updated atlas of the Prx superfamily identified using a novel method called MISST (Multi-level Iterative Sequence Searching Technique). MISST is an iterative search process developed to be both agglomerative, to add sequences containing similar functional site features, and divisive, to split groups when functional site features suggest distinct functionally-relevant clusters. Superfamily members need not be identified initially-MISST begins with a minimal representative set of known structures and searches GenBank iteratively. Further, the method's novelty lies in the manner in which isofunctional groups are selected; rather than use a single or shifting threshold to identify clusters, the groups are deemed isofunctional when they pass a self-identification criterion, such that the group identifies itself and nothing else in a search of GenBank. The method was preliminarily validated on the Prxs, as the Prxs presented challenges of both agglomeration and division. For example, previous sequence analysis clustered the Prx functional families Prx1 and Prx6 into one group. Subsequent expert analysis clearly identified Prx6 as a distinct functionally relevant group. The MISST process distinguishes these two closely related, though functionally distinct, families. Through MISST search iterations, over 38,000 Prx sequences were identified, which the method divided into six isofunctional clusters, consistent with previous expert analysis. The results represent the most complete computational functional analysis of proteins comprising the Prx superfamily. The feasibility of this novel method is demonstrated by the Prx superfamily results, laying the foundation for potential functionally relevant clustering of the universe of protein sequences.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005284,e1005284,1553-734X,1553-7358,ISI:000395718800008,NA,"Morris, John ""Scooter""/0000-0003-0290-7979 Poole, Leslie/0000-0003-0334-7328 Fetrow, Jacquelyn/0000-0002-0528-2049",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We explored the suitability of assemblage thresholds, defined as a point at which a small increase in a stressor will result in a disproportionally large change in assemblage structure relative to other points across the stressor gradient, to inform instream nutrient and sediment objectives. Identification and comparison of thresholds for macroinvertebrate, periphyton, and bacterial assemblages aimed at making the setting of objectives more robust and may further provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of nutrient and fine sediment effects. Gradient forest, a novel approach to assemblage threshold identification based on regression-tree-based random forest models for individual taxa, allowed inclusion of multiple predictors to strengthen the evidence of cause and effect between stressors and multispecies responses. The most prominent macroinvertebrate and periphyton assemblage threshold across the nitrogen (N) gradient was located at very low levels and mainly attributed to declines of multiple taxa. This provided strong evidence for stream assemblages being significantly affected when N concentrations exceed reference conditions and for effects cascading through the ecosystem. The most prominent macroinvertebrate assemblage threshold across a gradient of suspended fine sediment was also located at very low levels and attributed to declines of multiple taxa. However, this threshold did not correspond with periphyton assemblage thresholds, suggesting that the sensitivity of macroinvertebrate assemblages is unrelated to sediment effects on periphyton assemblages. Overall, the spectrum of N concentrations and fine sediment levels within which these stream assemblages changed most dramatically were relatively narrow given the wide gradients tested. We conclude that assemblage thresholds can inform the setting of generic instream nutrient and sediment objectives for stream ecosystem health. For example, the most stringent objective for instream N concentration should be set at values similar to reference concentrations for full protection of sensitive taxa or overall stream biodiversity. To avoid severe degradation of stream biodiversity, the least stringent N objective should stay well below the point where significant turnover subsided.",10.1002/eap.1457,NA,1051-0761,1939-5582,ISI:000395634300013,469-484,"Young, Roger/0000-0002-0999-4887","Young, Roger/B-6534-2008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This work deals with the general method of structure-function mapping at the whole-brain level. We formulate the problem as a topological mapping of structure-function connectivity via matrix function, and find a stable solution by exploiting a regularization procedure to cope with large matrices. We introduce a novel measure of network similarity based on persistent homology for assessing the quality of the network mapping, which enables a detailed comparison of network topological changes across all possible thresholds, rather than just at a single, arbitrary threshold that may not be optimal. We demonstrate that our approach can uncover the direct and indirect structural paths for predicting functional connectivity, and our network similarity measure outperforms other currently available methods. We systematically validate our approach with (1) a comparison of regularized vs. non-regularized procedures, (2) a null model of the degree-preserving random rewired structural matrix, (3) different network types (binary vs. weighted matrices), and (4) different brain parcellation schemes (low vs. high resolutions). Finally, we evaluate the scalability of our method with relatively large matrices (2514x2514) of structural and functional connectivity obtained from 12 healthy human subjects measured non-invasively while at rest.

Here, we explore six groundfish populations on the Scotian Shelf, Canada, where a decline in areas of high density beyond a certain threshold is associated with disproportionately large declines in Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB). This is evidenced by empirical, concave, positive relationships between high-density areas (HDAs) and SSB. We introduce a methodology to estimate the threshold below which SSB declines increasingly faster per unit of HDA decline. The spatial threshold among these six stocks was remarkably consistent; when stocks lose 70-80\% of HDAs, disproportionately large SSB declines are likely to occur. We propose that spatial thresholds could serve as spatial reference points to complement existing SSB limit reference points (LRPs). For some stocks we identify spatial thresholds which correspond to SSB levels that exceed those associated with the designated SSB LRP, suggesting that a review of these SSB LRPs warrants merit. For other stocks, spatial reference points can be used in concert with SSB reference points, strengthening efforts to incorporate a precautionary approach to fisheries management.

We quantified vegetation patterns and edge effects over a large geographic extent in Murchison Falls Conservation Area, Uganda, using freely available remotely sensed data. Over a 13-yr period, we quantified seasonal patterns in productivity using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), comparing the park exterior, a boundary zone <= 10 km from the border inside the park, and the park interior. To identify the extent of edge effects, we further fit mixed models by vegetation type within 1-km bands within the boundary zone. Productivity was higher in the park interior than exterior in both wet and dry seasons, and in the wet season, it was also lower in the boundary zone than the interior. NDVI variability differed between seasons; it declined from exterior to interior in the wet season, but was highest in the boundary zone and similar between interior and exterior during the dry season. Within the boundary zone, edge effects varied by land cover type and extended 4-6 km into MFCA. Abrupt differences in vegetation patterns between the park and adjacent unprotected areas indicated a ``hard edge{''} in this system. While hard edges are readily apparent, the subtle changes in productivity that extend into and degrade park systems are harder to detect.

Following Commission Decision 2010/477, we have applied two different spatial indicators to three fish populations with ``slow type{''} life-history traits, i.e. slow growing like Helicolenus daclylopterus, or large bodied like Merluccius merluccius and Lophius budegassa. We tested their efficiency separately and combined. One of these indicators, the presence/absence of the population in sampling squares, had already been applied during the initial assessment of the MSFD in Spain. Another indicator, the geographical spread, is proposed here as a new monitoring tool for the MSFD in Spanish waters. `` The results demonstrate for the three populations analyzed that neither indicator was sufficient alone to describe the population spatial pattern or its evolution. Thus, the approach to implementing the MSFD indicated in Commission Decision 2010/477 is not sufficient to provide integrated information about the spatial behavior of the fish populations analyzed. Although numerical targets or threshold values cannot be set, directional targets could be proposed, based on the results of both indicators, if evaluation of them is extended to more species and more geographical areas. The analysis could be extended to other ``slow type{''} populations within the fish community and also to different ecoregions. We propose an approach including the estimation of two different indicators to monitoring both the area occupied and the geographical spread of fish populations within communities, interpreting them together to generate a more complete picture of the spatial patterns of those populations. In spite of the difficulties in fixing numerical targets or thresholds, or in distinguishing between environmentally and human driven changes in the population spatial distributions, this approach helps to summarize fish spatial behavior. It improves information from the indicators applied alone and reduces the requirement for a large number of maps (except for some particular event or population). The proposed indicators can be readily used by managers and politicians. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Short-range connectivity within habitat networks provides organisms access to spatially distributed resources, reduces local extinctions and increases recolonization of habitat fragments. Long-range connectivity across habitat networks facilitates annual migrations and climate-driven range shifts. We present a method for identifying a multipurpose network of forest patches that promotes both short- and long-range connectivity. Our method uses both graph-theoretic analyses that quantify network connectedness and circuit-based analyses that quantify network traversability as the basis for identifying spatial conservation priorities on the landscape. We illustrate our approach in the agroecosystem, bordered by the Laurentian and Appalachian mountain ranges, that surrounds the metropolis of Montreal, Canada. We established forest conservation priorities for the ovenbird, a Neotropical migrant, sensitive to habitat fragmentation that breeds in our study area. All connectivity analyses were based on the same empirically informed resistance surface for ovenbird, but habitat pixels that facilitated short- and long-range connectivity requirements had low spatial correlation. The trade-off between connectivity requirements in the final ranking of conservation priorities showed a pattern of diminishing returns such that beyond a threshold, additional conservation of long-range connectivity had decreased effectiveness on the conservation of short-range connectivity. Highest conservation priority was assigned to a series of stepping stone forest patches across the study area that promote traversability between the bordering mountain ranges and to a collection of small forest fragments scattered throughout the study area that provide connectivity within the agroecosystem. Landscape connectivity is important for the ecology and genetics of populations threatened by climate change and habitat fragmentation. Our method has been illustrated as a means to conserve two critical dimensions of connectivity for a single species, but it is designed to incorporate a variety of connectivity requirements for many species.

However, often only partial resection is possible due to the location of the tumor. In that case, spontaneous regression, regrowth, or progression to a more aggressive form have been observed. The dependency between the residual tumor size and spontaneous regression is not understood yet. Therefore, the prognosis is largely unpredictable and there is controversy regarding the management of patients for whom complete resection cannot be achieved. Strategies span from pure observation (wait and see) to combinations of surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Here, we introduce a mathematical model to investigate the growth and progression behavior of PA. In particular, we propose a MARKOV chain model incorporating cell proliferation and death as well as mutations. Our model analysis shows that the tumor behavior after partial resection is essentially determined by a risk coefficient., which can be deduced from epidemiological data about PA. Our results quantitatively predict the regression probability of a partially resected benign PA given the residual tumor size and lead to the hypothesis that this dependency is linear, implying that removing any amount of tumor mass will improve prognosis.

By exploring various threshold values systematically, the profile of a species' trophic overlap can be constructed. Summing up the extent of trophic overlap across the whole profile for a species, we then obtain a new measure for species uniqueness.

Typically shocks are characterized as instantaneous, and isolated non-interacting events with the system dynamics corresponding to a fixed potential well. However, ecological systems are subject to continuous variation in environmental drivers such as rainfall, temperature, etc. and these interact with the ecosystem dynamics to alter the potential well. These variations are typically represented as a stochastic process. Furthermore, with climate change, the stochastic characteristics of the environmental drivers also change, thereby impacting the well dynamics. To characterize the resilience behavior under continuous variation in system drivers, and contrast it with that subject to instantaneous shock in system drivers, we employ the canonical catastrophic shift system as an example, and demonstrate emergent and contrasting divergent resilience behavior of the measures as the properties of the system-driver couple change. These behaviors include variability induced stabilization or enhancement of dynamic regimes, regions of sensitivity to dynamic regime transitions and existence of trap or escape regions. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of iso-resilience curves which are employed to design travel paths in resilience landscapes.

Wolbachia is one such symbiont where frequency-dependent reproductive benefits are opposed by frequency-independent fitness costs leading to bistable dynamics. Introduction of carriers does not assure invasion unless the initial frequency is above a threshold determined by the balance of costs and benefits. Recent laboratory experiments have uncovered that Wolbachia also protects their hosts from pathogens. The expected consequence of this phenotype in natural environments is to lower the invasion threshold by a factor that increases with the extent of pathogen exposure. Here, we introduce a series of mathematical models to address how pathogen protection affects Wolbachia invasion. First, under homogeneous symbiotic effects, we obtain an analytical expression for the invasion threshold in terms of pathogen exposure, and find a regime where symbiont releases may result in elimination of the entire host population provided that abundance of virulent pathogens is high. Second, we distribute Wolbachia effects such that some carriers are totally protected and others not at all, and explore how this interplays with different pathogen intensities, to conclude that heterogeneity further lowers the threshold for Wolbachia invasion. Third, we replicate the analysis using a realistic distribution of protective effects and confirm that heterogeneity increases system resilience by reducing the odds of population collapse.",10.1007/s12080-014-0235-7,NA,1874-1738,1874-1746,ISI:000349446900005,53-65,"Struchiner, Claudio/0000-0003-2114-847X Gomes, Gabriela/0000-0002-1454-4979 Teixeira, Luis/0000-0001-8326-6645 Souto-Maior, Caetano/0000-0002-0271-2576 Lopes, Joao/0000-0001-5670-2069 Gjini, Erida/0000-0002-0493-3102","Struchiner, Claudio/M-9360-2013 Gomes, Gabriela/H-7218-2014 Teixeira, Luis/H-6106-2013 ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, ADDs have also been highlighted as a conservation concern since they can inflict large-scale habitat exclusion in toothed whales (odontocetes). We tested a new method that selectively inflicted startle responses in harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) at close ranges to the loudspeaker but not in a non-target species, the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), by using a frequency range where porpoise hearing was less sensitive than that of phocid seals. The sound exposure consisted of isolated 200ms long, 2-3 octave-band noise pulses with a peak frequency of 1kHz, which were presented at a source level of approximate to 180dB re 1Pa. Field tests were carried out within a 2-month period on a fish farm on the west coast of Scotland where marine mammal behaviour was observed within three distance categories. Seal numbers dropped sharply during sound exposure compared with control observation periods within 250m of the sound source but were unaffected at distances further away from the farm. A Poisson regression model revealed that the number of seal tracks within 250m of the device decreased by approximate to 91\% during sound exposure and was primarily influenced by sound exposure with no evidence for a change in the effect of treatment such as habituation, throughout the experiment. In contrast to seals, there was no shift in the number of porpoise groups in each distance category as a result of sound exposure and porpoises were regularly seen close to the device.

We consider two criteria in this study, protection and recovery, which are further categorized into general and specific types, to examine four resilience scenarios, namely, key protection, general protection, general recovery, and key recovery. Spatial resilience is assessed with an indicator-based system, multi-criteria evaluation method, and spatial visualization based on a geographic information system (GIS) to create zones. Spatial zonings are evaluated in the context of different degrees of spatial resilience.

R. and Riley, T. and van den Bosch, F.",A generic risk-based surveying method for invading plant pathogens,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,2014,24,4,JUN,n,"Invasive plant pathogens are increasing with international trade and travel, with damaging environmental and economic consequences. Recent examples include tree diseases such as sudden oak death in the Western United States and ash dieback in Europe. To control an invading pathogen it is crucial that newly infected sites are quickly detected so that measures can be implemented to control the epidemic. However, since sampling resources are often limited, not all locations can be inspected and locations must be prioritized for surveying. Existing approaches to achieve this are often species specific and rely on detailed data collection and parameterization, which is difficult, especially when new arrivals are unanticipated. Consequently regulatory sampling responses are often ad hoc and developed without due consideration of epidemiology, leading to the suboptimal deployment of expensive sampling resources. We introduce a flexible risk-based sampling method that is pathogen generic and enables available information to be utilized to develop epidemiologically informed sampling programs for virtually any biologically relevant plant pathogen. By targeting risk we aim to inform sampling schemes that identify high-impact locations that can be subsequently treated in order to reduce inoculum in the landscape. This ``damage limitation{''} is often the initial management objective following the first discovery of a new invader. Risk at each location is determined by the product of the basic reproductive number (R-0), as a measure of local epidemic size, and the probability of infection. We illustrate how the risk estimates can be used to prioritize a survey by weighting a random sample so that the highest-risk locations have the highest probability of selection. We demonstrate and test the method using a high-quality spatially and temporally resolved data set on Huanglongbing disease (HLB) in Florida, USA.

Under these conditions, natural selection might favor rapid metabolic responses to the sudden availability of otherwise limiting resources. We introduce and define metabolic acceleration (alpha) as the first derivative of the metabolic rate of a living system with respect to time. As such, alpha describes the capacity of a biological system to up- and down-regulate metabolism and may be applied across scales and processes. To better understand the responses of roots and soil microbes to seasonal patterns of rainfall and plant activity, we compared soil respiratory acceleration (alpha(soil)) derived from soil respiration time-series among three microhabitats (under mesquite, under bunchgrasses, and in intercanopy soils) in a semi-arid shrubland near Tucson, Arizona. Across microhabitats, alpha(soil) was greatest during the warm, wet summer months and lowest during cool winter months. Throughout the year, alpha(soil) beneath mesquite was greater than beneath bunchgrasses or in intercanopy soils. Finally, microhabitat-specific responses of alpha(soil) to spring and monsoonal rainfall events were consistent with seasonal contrasts in the photosynthetic activity of deeply-rooted mesquite shrubs and warm-season bunchgrasses. By quantifying the capacity of living systems to respond to episodic resource availability, metabolic acceleration provides a new perspective and potentially unifying metric for biological responses to environmental heterogeneity.

An outdoor `bio-comfort' threshold is defined for Melbourne, Australia using a combination of heat stress, air particulate concentration and grass pollen count, where comfortable conditions imply an ideal range of temperature, humidity and wind speed, acceptable levels of air particulates and a low pollen count. This is a new approach to defining the comfort of human populations. While other works have looked into the separate impacts of different variables, this is the first time that a unified bio-comfort threshold is suggested. Composite maps of surface pressure are used to illustrate the genesis and evolution of the atmospheric structures conducive to an uncomfortable day. When there is an uncomfortable day due to heat stress conditions in Melbourne, there is a high pressure anomaly to the east bringing warm air from the northern interior of Australia. This anomaly is part of a slow moving blocking high originating over the Indian Ocean. Uncomfortable days due to high particulate levels have an approaching cold front. However, for air particulate cases during the cold season there are stable atmospheric conditions enhanced by a blocking high emanating from Australia and linking with the Antarctic continent. Finally, when grass pollen levels are high, there are northerly winds carrying the pollen from rural grass lands to Melbourne, due to a stationary trough of low pressure inland. Analysis into days with multiple types of stress revealed that the atmospheric signals associated with each type of discomfort are present regardless of whether the day is uncomfortable due to one or multiple variables.

ResultsOur approach allowed mapping of the variability in species richness and phylogenetic diversity projections, in addition to the mean, for 78 butterfly species. S-SDMs reproduced the observed decrease in phylogenetic diversity and species richness with elevation, a consequence of environmental filtering. The prediction accuracy of community properties varied along environmental gradients: at low elevations, variability was higher for predictions of species richness while it was the opposite for phylogenetic diversity.

Parameters appropriate for species-level clustering are usually derived from reference data and applied for the delineation of sequences of unknown species membership, although it is not clear how this should be carried out in a multilocus scenario. We introduce a novel means of concurrent clustering parameter optimization and delineation for multilocus data. A simulated annealing heuristic search is performed, whereby clustering thresholds are independently varied for each locus, but optimized according to the recovery of expected taxonomic species globally over loci. For each iteration of the search, one or more loci are randomly selected and a different threshold is separately proposed to cluster each, then the loci are linked to form global species units. Where the set of thresholds group the reference (species labelled) data with high taxonomic congruence, they are adopted for clustering of the subject (nonlabelled) sequences into global molecular operational taxonomic units (global MOTU). Four mined test data sets composed of both reference and subject sequences are combined with a newly sequenced three gene Apoidea data set, and subject to the proposed method. Even optimizing four loci and thousands of sequences, the approach rapidly convergences on a set of parameters with maximal optimality score, although the method masks a high degree of incongruence, and does not always converge on a single set of thresholds. For example, of the 476 Apoidea sequences, 70 global MOTU were inferred over the heuristic search, although the number of single gene MOTU were much lower for the 28S RNA locus, and a range of equally optimal clustering thresholds were observed for the CytB gene. We demonstrate the approach as a scalable species delineation solution for heterogeneous data sets composed of incompletely and inconsistently labelled data from public DNA data bases, for newly sequenced multilocus data, or both. The delineation over a heuristic search of clustering parameters facilitates the estimation of species diversity in multilocus data, giving species estimates that take into account uncertainty regarding choice of clustering thresholds.",10.1111/2041-210X.12104,NA,2041-210X,2041-2096,ISI:000325459600009,961-970,"ZHU, Chao-Dong/0000-0002-9347-3178","ZHU, Chao-Dong/E-5961-2011",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although long-term and detailed monitoring is required to conserve alpine ecosystems, field surveillance and satellite remote sensing have difficulties in providing wide coverage or frequent observation in mountain areas. In this study, a new method for monitoring alpine ecosystems by digital cameras was developed in order to detect both snow-cover areas and vegetation phenology at the plant community or species level. We used images from cameras that have been installed at mountain lodges in the northern Japanese Alps (at elevations around 2350-3100 m). Red, green, and blue (RGB) digital numbers were derived from each pixel within the images. The snow-cover and snow-free pixels were statistically classified by analysis of variance of gray-level histograms. A flexible threshold was determined for each image to maximize the between-class variance. The temporal variations of the snowmelt rate showed site-specific characteristics and yearly variations. The snowmelt times reflected the local microtopography and differed among the habitats of various functional types of vegetation (i.e., evergreen dwarf pine, deciduous shrubs, evergreen Sasa, tall forbs, and snowbed plants). In addition, the vegetation phenology was quantified by using a vegetation index (green ratio) calculated from RGB digital numbers. An increase in the green ratio indicated the start of the growing period following snowmelt and a decrease indicated leaf senescence. By using pixel-based analysis of the temporal variations of the green ratio, local distributions of the start and end dates and length of the growing period were illustrated at the plant species level for the first time. The distribution of the start of the growing period strongly corresponded to the snowmelt gradient, whereas the end of the growing period was related to the vegetation type. Our results suggest that the length of the growing period mainly corresponded to the snowmelt gradient in relation to the local microtopography. Thus, commercially available digital time-lapse cameras enabled us to clarify the snow vegetation relationships and the growing period at high temporal and spatial resolutions. This monitoring method should greatly improve our understanding of alpine ecosystems and help to assess the influence of future climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These soils are characterized by vertical differences with respect to soil texture and increasing bulk density below the topsoil, which in turn affects root penetration into the subsoil. Biopores are preferential pathways for roots and assist in overcoming physical barriers like high density soil layers. An integration of these relationships into cropping systems models at the field scale is on-going. This paper presents a new approach to model the effect of biopores on root development in soils with clay accumulation at the plot scale. In this approach, the effect of biopores on root elongation rate depends on bulk density and on a biopore-root growth threshold (MPRT), which is the biopore volume at which the resistance of soil strength to root penetration is completely offset by the density of the biopores. The approach was integrated into a model solution of the model framework SIMPLACE (Scientific Impact assessment and Modeling PLatform for Advanced Crop and Ecosystem management). MPRT was parameterized for spring wheat using the inverse modeling approach based on root observations from a multi-factorial field experiment on a Haplic Luvisol. The observed biopore densities (>2 mm diameter) were between 300 and 660 pores m(-2) (equivalent to a volumetric proportion of 0.38-0.83\%) depending on the preceding crop. Observed soil bulk densities ranged between 1.31 and 1.62 g cm(-3). For spring wheat, the best fit between simulated and observed root densities in different layers was obtained with a MPRT of 0.023 m(3) m(-3) (equivalent to 2.3\% of soil volume). The mean simulated total above ground biomass was sensitive to MPRT and had the best agreement with observed values when a MPRT between 0.023 and 0.032 m(3) m(-3) was used in the simulations. Scenario simulations with the parameterized model at the same site demonstrate the importance of biopores for biomass production of short-cycle spring wheat when prolonged dry spells occur. The simulations allow a rough quantification of the biopore effects with respect to root elongation rate and biomass production at the plot scale with the potential to be extended to the field scale.

Location Global applicability, using an example from New South Wales in south-eastern Australia. Methods Moving window analyses, rotated in 15 degrees increments through 360 degrees, are used to assess the degree of anisotropic spatial turnover between sets of gridded cells containing georeferenced species observations. Patterns of biotic turnover are compared with equivalent analyses for elevation and lithology. Identified breaks are assessed against an existing bioregionalization scheme (Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia, IBRA). Results There was fine-scale concordance between turnover patterns and several IBRA bioregions. Breaks in turnover of flora and fauna corresponded with the boundaries of the Hunter Valley and Sydney Basin regions, particularly the boundary between the Brigalow Belt South and Sydney Basin. Low-turnover zones were quantified; prominent examples are the Sydney Cataract and Wyong bioregions. Turnover along many boundaries was gradational, confirming that mapped breaks are not abrupt. A previously unidentified break was identified in the South East Corner bioregion. Spatial turnover patterns were similar between biota and were reflected in mean correlation coefficients between turnover in each group: mammalsreptiles (r = 0.70, P << 0.01); mammalsflora (r = 0.56, P << 0.01); and reptilesflora (r = 0.51, P << 0.01). Generally, patterns of abiotic turnover reflected biotic turnover, although mean turnover correlations were weaker than between biota. Main conclusions Using this method we were able to characterize taxic breaks and overlaps in detail and at a spatially fine resolution. For our study region, we confirm the overall integrity of the IBRA framework, but suggest that it may benefit from revision in some respects.",10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02739.x,NA,0305-0270,NA,ISI:000308876600010,1862-1876,"Laffan, Shawn/0000-0002-5996-0570 Ebach, Malte/0000-0002-9594-9010","Laffan, Shawn/A-3761-2008 ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

William",Guidelines for a graph-theoretic implementation of structural equation modeling,ECOSPHERE,2012,3,8,AUG,n,"Structural equation modeling (SEM) is increasingly being chosen by researchers as a framework for gaining scientific insights from the quantitative analyses of data. New ideas and methods emerging from the study of causality, influences from the field of graphical modeling, and advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability, and even purpose of SEM. Guidelines for implementing the expanded capabilities of SEM are currently lacking. In this paper we describe new developments in SEM that we believe constitute a third-generation of the methodology. Most characteristic of this new approach is the generalization of the structural equation model as a causal graph. In this generalization, analyses are based on graph theoretic principles rather than analyses of matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels and causal diagrams, as well as an increased emphasis on queries and probabilistic reasoning, are now included. Estimation under a graph theory framework permits the use of Bayesian or likelihood methods. The guidelines presented start from a declaration of the goals of the analysis. We then discuss how theory frames the modeling process, requirements for causal interpretation, model specification choices, selection of estimation method, model evaluation options, and use of queries, both to summarize retrospective results and for prospective analyses. The illustrative example presented involves monitoring data from wetlands on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia National Park. Our presentation walks through the decision process involved in developing and evaluating models, as well as drawing inferences from the resulting prediction equations. In addition to evaluating hypotheses about the connections between human activities and biotic responses, we illustrate how the structural equation (SE) model can be queried to understand how interventions might take advantage of an environmental threshold to limit Typha invasions. The guidelines presented provide for an updated definition of the SEM process that subsumes the historical matrix approach under a graph-theory implementation. The implementation is also designed to permit complex specifications and to be compatible with various estimation methods.

Due to the prominent implications to both public health and the pharmaceutical industry, it is of great importance to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which an adverse drug reaction can be potentially elicited. These mechanisms can be investigated by placing the pharmaco-epidemiologically detected adverse drug reaction in an information-rich context and by exploiting all currently available biomedical knowledge to substantiate it. We present a computational framework for the biological annotation of potential adverse drug reactions. First, the proposed framework investigates previous evidences on the drug-event association in the context of biomedical literature (signal filtering). Then, it seeks to provide a biological explanation (signal substantiation) by exploring mechanistic connections that might explain why a drug produces a specific adverse reaction. The mechanistic connections include the activity of the drug, related compounds and drug metabolites on protein targets, the association of protein targets to clinical events, and the annotation of proteins (both protein targets and proteins associated with clinical events) to biological pathways. Hence, the workflows for signal filtering and substantiation integrate modules for literature and database mining, in silico drug-target profiling, and analyses based on gene-disease networks and biological pathways.

Ecological data analysis frequently calls for the assessment of the relationship between species composition and a set of explanatory variables of interest. The assessment may have to be pursued while taking into account the influence of another set of explanatory variables. The hypothetical nature and structure of the influence of an explanatory set on the effect of a distinct explanatory set guides the proper choice of modelling methodology for a combined explanatory assessment. 2. Here, we describe a framework where the relationship between the response data and a main set of explanatory variables is not linear. It may, for example, take the form of abrupt changes in the response following thresholds of the explanatory variables, or any other nonlinearizable relationship. The influence of a second set of explanatory variables is determined a posteriori, after the influence of the main explanatory set has been taken into account. This is useful when one of the sets is thought to have an effect that varies as a function of the other. 3. To achieve this type of assessment, we propose a cascade of multivariate regression trees ( CMRT). We decompose the total dispersion of a response matrix between two explanatory data sets in a nested manner. By handling each leaf ( group) resulting from the first-level multivariate regression tree ( MRT) analysis as separate independent data sets in following analyses, we can separate the explanatory power of the first partition from those of the subordinate partitions computed using a second explanatory set. A preliminary biological hypothesis will guide the choice of which set of explanatory variables should be used to compute the main partition. The method could be extended to more than two explanatory data sets whose effects on the response data are hierarchical. 4. Cascade of multivariate regression trees allows the users to impose a nested structure to their causal hypotheses in MRT analysis.

We compiled a worldwide multitaxa database, comprising 185 communities, in order to study the relationship between the percentage of species represented by one individual (singletons) and the intensity of sampling (number of individuals divided by the number of species sampled). The database was used to empirically adjust a correction factor to improve the performance of non-parametrical estimators under conditions of low sampling effort. The correction factor was tested on seven estimators (Chao1, Chao2, Jack1, Jack2, ACE, ICE and Bootstrap). The correction factor was able to reduce the bias of all estimators tested under conditions of undersampling, while converging to the original uncorrected values at higher intensities. Our findings led us to recommend the threshold of 20 individuals/species, or less than 21\% of singletons, as a minimum sampling effort to produce reliable richness estimates of high diverse ecosystems using corrected non-parametric estimators. This threshold rise for 50 individuals/species if non-corrected estimators are used which implies in an economy of 60\% of sampling effort if the correction factor is used. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the process of reverse network modeling, the relationships with less relevance are generally not considered by determining a threshold when the relationships among genes are mined. However, there are no effective methods to determine the threshold up to now. It is worthwhile to note that the phenotypes of genetic diseases are generally regarded as external representation of the functions of genes. Therefore, two types of phenotype networks are constructed from gene and disease views, respectively, and through comparing these two types of phenotype networks, the threshold of gene network corresponding to a certain disease can be determined when their similarity reaches to maximum. Because the gene network is determined based on the relationships among phenotypes and phenotypes are external representation of the functions of genes, it is considered that relationships in the gene network may show functional relationships among genes in biological system. In this work, the thresholds 0.47 and 0.48 of gene network are determined based on Parkinson disease phenotypes. Furthermore, the validity of these thresholds is verified by the specificity and susceptibility of phenotype networks. Also, through comparing the structural parameters of gene networks for normal and disease stage at different thresholds, significant difference between the two gene networks at threshold 0.47 or 0.48 is found.

Using an Australian estuary as a case study, we developed a novel approach to create a data-derived state-and-transition model. The model identifies suites of co-occurring birds, fish, benthic invertebrates and aquatic macrophytes (as `states') and the changing physico-chemical conditions that are associated with each ('transitions'). The approach first used cluster analysis to identify sets of co-occurring biota. Differences in the physico-chemical data associated with each state were identified using classification trees, with the biotic distinctness of the resultant statistical model tested using analysis of similarities. The predictive capacity of the model was tested using new cases. Two models were created using different time-steps (annual and quarterly) and then combined to capture both longer-term trends and more-recent declines in ecological condition. We identified eight ecosystem states that were differentiated by a mix of water-quantity and water-quality variables. Each ecosystem state represented a distinct biotic assemblage under well-defined physico-chemical conditions. Two `basins of attraction' were identified, with four tidally-influenced states, and another four independent of tidal influence. Within each basin, states described a continuum of relative health, manifest through declining taxonomic diversity and abundances. The main threshold determining relative health was whether freshwater flows had occurred in the region during the previous 339 days. Canonical analyses of principal coordinates tested the predictive capacity of the model and demonstrated that the variance in the environmental data set was well captured (87\%) with 52\% of the variance in the biological data set also captured. The latter increased to >80\% when long- and short-term biological data were analysed separately, indicating that the model described the available data for the Coorong well. This approach thus created a data-derived, multivariate model, where neither states nor transitions were determined a priori. The approach did not over-fit the data, was robust to patchy or missing data, the choice of initial clustering technique and random errors in the biological data set, and was well-received by local natural resource managers. However, the model did not capture causal relationships and requires additional testing, particularly during future episodes of ecological recovery. The approach shows significant promise for simplifying management definitions of ecological condition and, via scenario analyses, can be used to assist in manager decision-making of large, complex aquatic ecosystems in the future.

Coincident regime shifts were detected in phytoplankton, benthos, and fish in 1995, which was just after invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena spp.) became established in the bay in 1993-1994. Two independent methods were used to detect these shifts: 1) principal components analysis followed by a Regime Shift Detector test for a change point in the running mean of the first principal component scores and (2) measurements of significant difference between pre- and post-Dreissena ecosystem structure based on measures of Bray-Curtis community similarity. Although a statistically significant shift was not detected in the zooplankton community by itself, zooplankton variables were instrumental in the overall ecosystem shift, determined for the combined four communities. All 32 variables were ranked for their individual contribution to the difference between the pre- and post-Dreissena ecosystem structures. The resolution of two distinct ecosystem structures, pre- and post-Dreissena, was greatly improved after employing a novel method of variable optimization that involved a selective and sequential removal of variables contributing least to the statistical difference between pre- and post-Dreissena ecosystem structures.

Organism-environment models are used widely in conservation. The degree to which they are useful for informing conservation decisions - the conservation relevance of these relations - is important because lack of relevance may lead to misapplication of scarce conservation resources or failure to resolve important conservation dilemmas. Even when models perform well based on model fit and predictive ability, conservation relevance of associations may not be clear without also knowing the magnitude and variability of predicted changes in response variables. 2. We introduce a method for evaluating the conservation relevance of organism-environment relations that employs confidence intervals for predicted changes in response variables. The confidence intervals are compared to a preselected magnitude of change that marks a threshold (trigger) for conservation action. To demonstrate the approach, we used a case study from the Chihuahuan Desert involving relations between avian richness and broad-scale patterns of shrubland. We considered relations for three winters and two spatial extents (1- and 2-km-radius areas) and compared predicted changes in richness to three thresholds (10\%, 20\% and 30\% change). For each threshold, we examined 48 relations. 3. The method identified seven, four and zero conservation-relevant changes in mean richness for the 10\%, 20\% and 30\% thresholds respectively. These changes were associated with major (20\%) changes in shrubland cover, mean patch size, the coefficient of variation for patch size, or edge density but not with major changes in shrubland patch density. The relative rarity of conservation-relevant changes indicated that, overall, the relations had little practical value for informing conservation decisions about avian richness. 4. The approach we illustrate is appropriate for various response and predictor variables measured at any temporal or spatial scale. The method is broadly applicable across ecological environments, conservation objectives, types of statistical predictive models and levels of biological organization. By focusing on magnitudes of change that have practical significance, and by using the span of confidence intervals to incorporate uncertainty of predicted changes, the method can be used to help improve the effectiveness of conservation efforts.",10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00042.x,NA,2041-210X,NA,ISI:000288914700004,351-358,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Different methods of numerical classification produce different results, and the question is which of them, and how many clusters, should be selected for interpretation. We demonstrate a new method for identifying the optimal partition from a series of partitions of the same set of sites, based on number of species with high fidelity to clusters in a partition (faithful species). Methods The new method, OptimClass, has two variants. OptimClass 1 searches the partition with the maximum number of faithful species across all clusters, while OptimClass 2 searches the partition with the maximum number of clusters that contain at least a preselected minimum number of faithful species. Faithful species are determined based on the P value of the Fisher's exact test, as a measure of fidelity. OptimClass was tested on three vegetation datasets that varied in species richness and internal heterogeneity, using several classification algorithms, resemblance measures and cover transformations. Results Results from both variants of OptimClass depended on the preselected threshold P value for faithful species: higher P gave higher probability that a partition with more clusters was selected as optimal. Good partitions, in terms of OptimClass criteria, involved flexible beta clustering, and also ordinal clustering. Good partitions were also obtained with TWINSPAN when the required number of clusters was small, or UPGMA when the required number of clusters was large. Poor partitions usually resulted from classifications that used resemblance measures and cover transformations emphasizing differences in species cover; this is not unexpected because OptimClass uses a presence/absence-based fidelity measure. Conclusions If the aim of a classification is to obtain clusters rich in faithful species, which can be subsequently used as diagnostic species for identification of community types, OptimClass is a suitable method for simultaneous choice of the optimal classification algorithm and optimal number of clusters.

Existing methods for identifying ecological community thresholds are designed for univariate indicators or multivariate dimension-reduction of community structure. Most are insensitive to responses of individual taxa with low occurrence frequencies or highly variable abundances, properties of the vast majority of taxa in community data sets. We introduce Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) to detect changes in taxa distributions along an environmental gradient over space or time, and assess synchrony among taxa change points as evidence for community thresholds. 2. TITAN uses indicator species scores to integrate occurrence, abundance and directionality of taxa responses. It identifies the optimum value of a continuous variable, x, that partitions sample units while maximizing taxon-specific scores. Indicator z scores standardize original scores relative to the mean and SD of permuted samples along x, thereby emphasizing the relative magnitude of change and increasing the contributions of taxa with low occurrence frequencies but high sensitivity to the gradient. TITAN distinguishes negative (z-) and positive (z+) taxa responses and tracks cumulative responses of declining {[}sum(z-)] and increasing {[}sum(z+)] taxa in the community. Bootstrapping is used to estimate indicator reliability and purity as well as uncertainty around the location of individual taxa and community change points. 3. Using two simulated data sets, TITAN correctly identified taxon and community thresholds in more than 99\% of 500 unique versions of each simulation. In contrast, multivariate change-point analysis did not distinguish directional taxa responses, resulting in much wider confidence intervals that in one instance failed to capture thresholds in 38\% of the iterations. 4. Retrospective analysis of macroinvertebrate community response to a phosphorus gradient supported previous threshold estimates, although TITAN produced narrower confidence limits and revealed that several taxa declined at lower levels of phosphorus. Re-analysis of macroinvertebrate responses to an urbanization gradient illustrated disparate change points for declining (0.81-3.3\% urban land) and increasing (6.8-26.6\%) taxa, whereas the published threshold estimate (20-30\%) missed the declining-taxa threshold because it could not distinguish their synchronous decline from the gradual increase in ubiquitous taxa. 5. Synthesis and applications. By deconstructing communities to assess synchrony of taxon-specific change points, TITAN provides a sensitive and precise alternative to existing methods for assessing community thresholds. TITAN has tremendous potential to inform conservation of rare or threatened species, develop species sensitivity models, identify reference conditions and to support development of numerical regulatory criteria.",10.1111/j.2041-210X.2009.00007.x,NA,2041-210X,NA,ISI:000288913700004,25-37,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Certain classes of change in the characteristics of an ecosystem, labelled regime shifts, have been observed in marine and freshwater ecosystems world-wide. Few tools, however, have been offered to detect and identify regime shifts in time-series data. 2. We use a novel approach based on tools taken from the world of statistics, and econometrics to examine the occurrence of a regime shift in the predatory zooplankton population of Lake Kinneret, Israel. The tools are a free-knot spline mean function estimation method and a Markov-switching vector autoregression model. 3. Our approach detected, with high probability, the occurrence of a regime shift in the zooplankton population in the early to mid-1990s. This was in-line with expectations based on similar events observed in the lake. 4. The suggested approach is a step forward from existing approaches in that it does not require any pre-determent of threshold values but rather relies on a hidden underlying stochastic process that yields probabilities of regime shifts. Thus, it can therefore be applied without introducing any prior biases into the analysis. The approach is, therefore, an objective method in detecting the likely occurrence of a regime shift.",10.1111/j.2041-210X.2009.00006.x,NA,2041-210X,NA,ISI:000288913700006,45-52,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although there exist a number of mathematical models for the interaction of prions with their native counterpart, prion transport and spread is usually neglected. The concentration dynamics of prions, and thus the dynamics of the disease progression, however, are influenced by prion transport, especially in a medium as complex as the brain. Therefore, we focus here on the interaction between prion concentration dynamics and prion transport. The model is constructed by combining a model of prion-prion interaction with transport on networks. The approach leads to a system of reaction-diffusion equations, whereby the diffusion term is discrete. The equations are solved numerically on domains given as large networks. We show that the prion concentration grows faster on networks characterized by a higher degree heterogeneity. Furthermore, we introduce cell death as a consequence of increasing prion concentration, leading to network decomposition. We show that infectious diseases destroy networks similarly to targeted attacks, namely by affecting the nodes with the highest degree first. Relating the incubation period and disease progression to the process of network decomposition, we find that, interestingly, a long incubation time followed by sudden onset and fast progression of the disease does not need to be reflected in the overall concentration dynamics of the infective agent.",10.1142/S0218339009003010,NA,0218-3390,NA,ISI:000273426400005,623-641,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is plausible to assume, in general, that well-linked species, being key interactors, are also more important for the community. Recently a number of methods have been suggested for quantifying the network position of species in ecological networks (like the topological importance metric, TI). Most of them are based on node centrality indices and it may happen that the two most important species in a food web have very similar interaction structure and they can essentially replace each other if one becomes extinct. For conservation considerations it is a challenge to identify species that are richly connected and, at the same time, have a relatively unique and irreplaceable interaction pattern. We present a new method and illustrate our approach by using the Kuosheng Bay trophic network in Taiwan. The new method is based on the interaction matrix, where the strength of the interaction between nodes i and j depends only on topology. By defining a threshold separating weak and strong interactors, we define the effective range of interactions for each graph node. If the overlaps between pairs of these ranges are quantified, we gain a metric expressing how unique is the interaction pattern of a focal node (TO). The combination of centrality (TI) and uniqueness (TO) is called topological functionality (TF). We compare the nodal importance rank provided by this metric to others based on a variety of centrality measures. The main conclusion is that shrimps seem to have the most unique interaction pattern despite that their structural importance has been underestimated by all conventional centrality indices. Also, our network analysis suggests that fisheries disturb the ecosystem in a more critical network position than the impingement by the local power plant. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These services, however, are often ignored in pest management decision making. In addition, the use of broad-spectrum insecticides can damage the populations of natural enemies, reducing the cost-effectiveness of insecticide investment if unaccounted for in treatment decisions. The existing literature on modeling of biological control of insect pests has generally focused on simulations of the population dynamics of pest and natural enemy species and the processes underlying pest control. But agriculture is a managed ecosystem where predator-prey relationships are heavily influenced by human managers. In modeling managerial choices, this study develops an intra-seasonal dynamic bioeconomic optimization model for insecticide-based pest management that explicitly takes into account both the biological control effect of natural enemies on pest density and the nontarget mortality effect of insecticides on the level of natural pest control supplied. The model captures predator-prey interactions, linking them to crop growth and yield damage functions, which in turn are evaluated in a dynamic optimization framework. We introduce a new decision rule for judicious insecticide decisions using a natural enemy-adjusted economic threshold. This threshold represents the pest population density at which insecticide control becomes optimal in spite of the opportunity cost of injury to natural enemies of the target pest. Using field data from Michigan, the model is applied to the case of soybean aphid (Aphis glycines, Matsumura), a recent invasive pest of soybean (Glycine max), whose management is of both economic and environmental importance to the North Central region of the United States. As illustrated by the numerical examples, such natural enemy-adjusted threshold is likely to lead to fewer recommendations for insecticide use than naive models that ignore natural enemies, resulting in less insecticide use, while maintaining profitability for farmers that rely on chemical pest control methods. The bioeconomic model developed in this study can be used to conduct a wide variety of analyses such as identifying dynamically optimal spray strategies and estimating the implied economic value of natural control services. Furthermore, with the incorporation of inter-year carry-over factors, such as overwintering of pests and natural enemies, the current model can contribute to building multi-year models for studying long-term pest management.

The evolution of flowering strategies (when and at what size to flower) in monocarpic perennials is determined by balancing current reproduction with expected future reproduction, and these are largely determined by size-specific patterns of growth and survival. However, because of the difficulty in following long-lived individuals throughout their lives, this theory has largely been tested using short-lived species (< 5 years). 2. Here, we tested this theory using the long-lived monocarpic perennial Campanula thyrsoides which can live up to 16 years. We used a novel approach that combined permanent plot and herb chronology data from a 3-year field study to parameterize and validate integral projection models (IPMs). 3. Similar to other monocarpic species, the rosette leaves of C. thyrsoides wither over winter and so size cannot be measured in the year of flowering. We therefore extended the existing IPM framework to incorporate an additional time delay that arises because flowering demography must be predicted from rosette size in the year before flowering. 4. We found that all main demographic functions (growth, survival probability, flowering probability and fecundity) were strongly size-dependent and there was a pronounced threshold size of flowering. There was good agreement between the predicted distribution of flowering ages obtained from the IPMs and that estimated in the field. Mostly, there was good agreement between the IPM predictions and the direct quantitative field measurements regarding the demographic parameters lambda, R-0 and T. We therefore conclude that the model captures the main demographic features of the field populations. 5. Elasticity analysis indicated that changes in the survival and growth function had the largest effect (c. 80\%) on lambda and this was considerably larger than in short-lived monocarps. We found only weak selection pressure operating on the observed flowering strategy which was close to the predicted evolutionary stable strategy. 6. Synthesis. The extended IPM accurately described the demography of a long-lived monocarpic perennial using data collected over a relatively short period. We could show that the evolution of flowering strategies in short- and long-lived monocarps seem to follow the same general rules but with a longevity-related emphasis on survival over fecundity.",10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01374.x,NA,0022-0477,1365-2745,ISI:000256635800027,821-832,NA,"Stocklin, Jurg/F-5029-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Object-based classification is a new method that can achieve the same objective based on the segmentation of spectral bands of the image creating homogeneous polygons with regard to spatial or spectral characteristics. The segmentation algorithm does not solely rely on the single pixel value, but also on shape, texture, and pixel spatial continuity. The object-based classification is a knowledge base process where an interpretation key is developed using ground control points and objects are assigned to specific classes according to threshold values of determined spectral and/or spatial attributes. We developed a model using the eCognition software to identify suitable habitats for the Grasshopper Sparrow, a rare and declining species found in southwestern Quebec. The model was developed in a region with known breeding sites and applied on other images covering adjacent regions where potential breeding habitats may be present. We were successful in locating potential habitats in areas where dairy farming prevailed but failed in an adjacent region covered by a distinct Landsat scene and dominated by annual crops. We discuss the added value of this method, such as the possibility to use the contextual information associated to objects and the ability to eliminate unsuitable areas in the segmentation and land cover classification processes, as well as technical and logistical constraints.

Recent modeling studies have shown that different combinations of active conductances can evoke similar firing patterns, but have neglected how morphology might contribute to homeostasis. Parameterizing the morphology of a cylindrical dendrite, we introduce a novel application of mathematical sensitivity analysis that quantifies how dendritic length, diameter, and surface area influence neuronal firing, and compares these effects directly against those of active parameters. The method was applied to a model of neurons from goldfish Area II. These neurons exhibit, and likely contribute to, persistent activity in eye velocity storage, a simple model of working memory. We introduce sensitivity landscapes, defined by local sensitivity analyses of firing rate and gain to each parameter, performed globally across the parameter space. Principal directions over which sensitivity to all parameters varied most revealed intrinsic currents that most controlled model output. We found domains where different groups of parameters had the highest sensitivities, suggesting that interactions within each group shaped firing behaviors within each specific domain. Application of our method, and its characterization of which models were sensitive to general morphologic features, will lead to advances in understanding how realistic morphology participates in functional homeostasis. Significantly, we can predict which active conductances, and how many of them, will compensate for a given age- or development-related structural change, or will offset a morphologic perturbation resulting from trauma or neurodegenerative disorder, to restore normal function. Our method can be adapted to analyze any computational model.

The respective surveys provide a high number of interrelated species occurrence variables. Since often only a limited number of ecological gradients determine species distributions, the data might be represented by much fewer but effectively independent variables. This can be achieved by reducing the dimensionality of the data. Conventional methods are either limited to linear feature extraction (e.g., principal component analysis, and Classical Multidimensional Scaling, CMDS) or require a priori assumptions on the intrinsic data dimensionality (e.g., Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling, NMDS, and self organized maps, SOM). In this study we explored the potential of Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap). This new method of dimensionality reduction is a nonlinear generalization of CMDS. Isomap is based on a nonlinear geodesic inter-point distance matrix. Estimating geodesic distances requires one free threshold parameter, which defines linear geometry to be preserved in the global nonlinear distance structure. We compared Isomap to its linear (CMDS) and nonmetric NMDS) equivalents. Furthermore, the use of geodesic distances allowed also extending NMDS to a version that we called NMDS-G. In addition we investigated a supervised Isomap valiant (S-Isomap) and showed that all these techniques are interpretable within a single methodical framework. As an example we investigated seven plots (subdivided in 456 subplots) in different secondary tropical montane forests with 773 species of vascular plants. A key problem for the study of tropical vegetation data is the heterogeneous small scale variability implying large ranges of beta-diversity. The CMDS and NMDS methods did not reduce the data dimensionality reasonably. On the contrary, Isomap, explained 95\% of the data variance in the first five dimensions and provided ecologically interpretable visualizations; NMDS-G yielded similar results. The main shortcoming of the latter was the high computational cost and the requirement to predefine the dimension of the embedding space. The S-Isomap learning scheme did not improve the Isomap variant for an optimal threshold parameter but substantially improved the nonoptimal solutions. We conclude that Isomap as a new ordination method allows effective representations of high dimensional vegetation data sets. The method is promising since it does not require a priori assumptions, and is computationally highly effective.",10.1016/j.ecoinf.2007.05.002,NA,1574-9541,1878-0512,ISI:000249940600010,138-149,"Mahecha, Miguel/0000-0003-3031-613X Lischeid, Gunnar/0000-0003-3700-6062","Mahecha, Miguel/F-2443-2010 Lischeid, Gunnar/F-9383-2016",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We shall examine an optimal impulsive control problem in the management of an epidemic to control a pest population. We introduce a small amount of pathogen into a pest population with the expectation that it will generate an epidemic and that it will subsequently be endemic such that the number of pests is no larger than the given economic threshold (ET), so that the pests cannot cause economic damage. This is the biological control strategy given in the present paper. The combination strategy of pulse capturing (susceptible individuals) and pulse releasing (infective individuals) is implemented in the model if the number of pests (susceptible) reaches the ET. Firstly, the impulsive control problem is to drive the pest population below a given pest level and to do so in a manner which minimizes a weighted sum of the cost of using the control. Hence, for a one time impulsive effect we obtain the optimal strategy in terms of total cost such that the number of pests is no larger than the given ET. Secondly, we show the existence of periodic solution with the number of pests no larger than ET, and by using the Analogue of the Poincare Criterion we prove that it is asymptotically stable under a planned impulsive control strategy. Further, the period T of the periodic solution is calculated, which can be used to estimate how long the pest population will take to return back to its pre-control level.

Thus, protocols based on intensive resampling of empirical data have been proposed to assess guild structure. Such protocols obtain the frequency distribution of a given functional similarity metric, and identify a threshold value (often the 95th percentile) beyond which clusters in a functional dendrogram are considered as significant guilds (using one-tailed tests). An alternative approach sequentially searches for significant differences between clusters at decreasing levels of similarity in a dendrogram until one is detected, then assumes that all subsequent nodes should also be significant. Nevertheless, these protocols do not test both the significance and sign of deviations from random at all levels of functional similarity within a dendrogram. Here, we propose a new bootstrapping approach that: (1) overcomes such pitfalls by performing two-tailed tests for each node in a dendrogram of functional similarity after separately determining their respective sample distributions, and (2) enables the quantification of the relative contribution of guild aggregation and functional divergence to the overall functional structure of the entire assemblage. We exemplify this approach by using long-term data on guild dynamics in a vertebrate predator assemblage of central Chile.

The data of various retroviral insertional mutagenesis screens are compiled in the publicly available Retroviral Tagged Cancer Gene Database (RTCGD). Integrally analyzing these screens for the presence of common insertion sites (CISs, i.e., regions in the genome that have been hit by viral insertions in multiple independent tumors significantly more than expected by chance) requires an approach that corrects for the increased probability of finding false CISs as the amount of available data increases. Moreover, significance estimates of CISs should be established taking into account both the noise, arising from the random nature of the insertion process, as well as the bias, stemming from preferential insertion sites present in the genome and the data retrieval methodology. We introduce a framework, the kernel convolution (KC) framework, to find CISs in a noisy and biased environment using a predefined significance level while controlling the family-wise error (FWE) (the probability of detecting false CISs). Where previous methods use one, two, or three predetermined fixed scales, our method is capable of operating at any biologically relevant scale. This creates the possibility to analyze the CISs in a scale space by varying the width of the CISs, providing new insights in the behavior of CISs across multiple scales. Our method also features the possibility of including models for background bias. Using simulated data, we evaluate the KC framework using three kernel functions, the Gaussian, triangular, and rectangular kernel function. We applied the Gaussian KC to the data from the combined set of screens in the RTCGD and found that 53\% of the CISs do not reach the significance threshold in this combined setting.

The main feature of the SIE is that below an upper size threshold an increase of species number with increase of area in small islands is not observed. Location Species richness patterns from different taxa and insular systems are analysed. Methods Sixteen different data sets from 12 studies are analysed. Path analysis was used for the estimation of the upper limit of the SIE. We studied each data set in order to detect whether there was a certain island size under which the direct effects of area were eliminated. This detection was carried out through the sequential exclusion of islands from the largest to the smallest. For the cases where an SIE was detected, a log-log plot of species number against area is presented. The relationships between habitat diversity, species number and area are studied within the limits of the SIE. In previous studies only area was used for the detection of the SIE, whereas we also encompass habitat diversity, a parameter with well documented influence on species richness, especially at small scales. Results An SIE was detected in six out of the 16 studied cases. The upper limit of the SIE varies, depending on the characteristics of the taxon and the archipelago under study. In general, the values of the upper limit of the SIE calculated according to the approach undertaken in our study differ from the values calculated in previous studies. Main conclusions Although the classical species-area models have been used to estimate the upper limit of the SIE, we propose that the detection of this phenomenon should be undertaken independently from the species-area relationship, so that the net effects of area are calculated excluding the surrogate action of area on other variables, such as environmental heterogeneity. The SIE appears when and where area ceases to influence species richness directly. There are two distinct SIE patterns: (1) the classical SIE where both the direct and indirect effects of area are eliminated and (2) the cryptic SIE where area affects species richness indirectly. Our approach offers the opportunity of studying the different factors influencing biodiversity on small scales more accurately. The SIE cannot be considered a general pattern with fixed behaviour that can be described by the same model for different island groups and taxa.

An objective function is formed in terms of projected loss of individual fish, the projected profit of killing a pest and the cost of spraying insecticide for a finite time period. Next the corresponding pest management model is formed by considering the growth equations of paddy, pest, and fish of the soil water. The model is analyzed by control theoretic means to determine the threshold limits of pesticide to be used. Lastly, the optimal value of pesticide is obtained. It is shown that the optimal value lies within the threshold limits. Finally corresponding to this optimal threshold value of pesticide, the optimal values of the biomass of paddy and that of the fish of the soil water are also obtained. The results are finally verified numerically by special choice of parameters compatible with the model.",10.1142/S0218339005001422,NA,0218-3390,1793-6470,ISI:000230151800002,117-130,NA,NA,"Workshop and Conference on Differential Equations in Biology and Medicine, Bedlewo, POLAND, SEP 29-OCT 03, 2003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we describe two improvements to Marshall's method. First, we show that more precise estimates of the position of such a boundary may be obtained using range extensions with confidence levels of less than 50\% (e.g., 20\%). Second, we introduce a new method of calculating confidence intervals that explicitly takes into account the position of the highest fossil find. Incorporating these improvements leads to confidence intervals for simulated data sets that are approximately four times more precise than those obtained by using Marshall's (1995) original method and approximately twice as precise as those using other published methods. We provide a look-up table that shows for different numbers of taxa the confidence level that should be used to maximize the precision of the estimated position of the extinction boundary, while ensuring that the boundary still lies within the stratigraphic interval bounded by at least one range extension. Unlike some other methods, our method is nonparametric and does not make the restrictive assumption of uniform preservation and recovery potential.

To detect significant features occurring at specific levels of organization in a landscape, two steps are required. First, a multiscale dataset must be generated from which these features can emerge. Second, a procedure must be developed to delineate individual image-objects and identify them as they change through scale. In this paper, we introduce a framework for the automatic definition of multiscale landscape features using object-specific techniques and marker-controlled watershed segmentation. By applying this framework to a high-resolution satellite scene, image-objects of varying size and shape can be delineated and studied individually at their characteristic scale of expression. This framework involves three main steps: 1) multiscale dataset generation using an object-specific analysis and upscaling technique, 2) marker-controlled watershed transformation to automatically delineate individual image-objects as they evolve through scale, and 3) landscape feature identification to assess the significance of these image-objects in terms of meaningful landscape features. This study was conducted on an agro-forested region in southwest Quebec, Canada, using IKONOS satellite data. Results show that image-objects tend to persist within one or two scale domains, and then suddenly disappear at the next, while new image-objects emerge at coarser scale domains. We suggest that these patterns are associated to sudden shifts in the entire image structure at certain scale domains, which may correspond to critical landscape thresholds.",10.1023/B:LAND.0000018371.43447.1f,NA,0921-2973,NA,ISI:000189394100005,59-76,"Hall, Ola/0000-0002-9231-4028",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I introduce briefly both types of thresholds. First, I discuss the Allee effect in the context of eradication strategies of alien species. Then, I consider an example of parametric threshold: the critical amount of suitable habitat below which a metapopulation goes deterministically extinct. I review how this spatial threshold changes in relation to the level of spatial detail and the complexity of the food web. Since classical metapopulation models assume an infinite number of patches, I proceed by considering how the extinction threshold is affected by environmental variability acting on a small number of patches. Finally, I consider recent work suggesting that if the network of connectivity among patches is not random but highly heterogeneous, the extinction threshold may disappear.",NA,NA,0003-455X,NA,ISI:000183295600004,99-114,"Bascompte, Jordi/0000-0002-0108-6411 CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602","Bascompte, Jordi/B-7596-2008 CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011","Conference on Extinction Thresholds, UNIV HELSINKI, DEPT ECOL SYSTEMAT, HELSINKI, FINLAND, SEP 02-05, 2002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Endangered Species Act (ESA) mandates that recovery plans include specific criteria to determine when a species should be removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. To meet this mandate, we developed a new approach to determining classification criteria for long-lived vertebrates The key idea is that endangerment depends on two critical aspects of a population: population size and trends in population size due to intrinsic variability in population growth rates. The way to combine these features is to identify a population size and range of population growth rates (where lambda denotes the annual multiplicative rate of change of a population) above which there is a negligible probability of extinction. To do so, (1) information on the current population size and its variance is specified; (2) available information on vital rates or changes in abundance over time is used to generate a probability distribution for the population's lambda; (3) the lower fifth percentile value for lambda (denoted as lambda((0.05)))is obtained from the frequency distribution of lambda s and (4) if lambda((0.05)) is <1.0, a backwards population trajectory starting at 500 individuals for a period of 10 years is performed and the resulting population size is designated as the threshold for listing a species as endangered, or if lambda((0.05)) is greater than or equal to 1.0, the threshold for endangerment is set at 500 animals. A similar approach can be used to determine the threshold for listing a species as threatened under the ESA. We applied this approach to North Pacific humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and used Monte Carlo simulations to produce a frequency distribution of lambda s for the whales under three different scenarios. Using lambda((0.05)) it was determined that the best estimates of current abundance for the central population of North Pacific humpback whales were larger than the estimated threshold for endangered status but less than the estimated threshold for threatened status if accepted by the responsible management agency this analysis would be consistent with a recommendation to downlist the central stock of humpback whales to a status of threatened, whereas the status of eastern and western stocks would remain endangered.",10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.98277.x,NA,0888-8892,1523-1739,ISI:000082821400032,1203-1214,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Each block fulfils a given minimum criterion regarding its density. With a density threshold of e.g. 50 \%, blocks are formed with only those species that are present in at least 50 \% of the block's releves, while at the same time the block's releves comprise at least 50 \% of the block's species. The procedure starts with the complete table and iteratively masks species and releves with the smallest densities. This is performed step by step with species and releves and continues until the given density threshold for all species and releves is exceeded. Without any further parameters other than the minimum density, species-releve groups of gradually decreasing size are formed. Data processing is performed with a computer program (ESPRESSO). The main application of the method is found in an effective pre-sorting of releve data.

The exponent b (allometric factor) seemed to be the main parameter, performing a key role in the equation W = aL(b), where W = weight, a is a constant and L = length. The parameters a (condition factor) and K (ponderal index; K = 10(3) W/L3) were judged to be less important in comparative studies, since these parameters were closely correlated with b. It is recommended that the assumed theoretical value of b = 3 not be used in applied ichthyological surveys, since this value was rarely obtained in the studies, and since a much wider range is usually seen. These analyses led to a new working hypothesis - not yet verified - which opens a new approach to understanding the biological significance of the allometric factor.
