Abstract = {{Monitoring and adaptive management are fundamental concepts to rangeland
   management across land management agencies and embodied as best
   management practices for private landowners. Historically, rangeland
   monitoring was limited to determining impacts or maximizing the
   potential of specific land uses-typically grazing. Over the past several
   decades, though, the uses of and disturbances to rangelands have
   increased dramatically against a backdrop of global climate change that
   adds uncertainty to predictions of future rangeland conditions. Thus,
   today's monitoring needs are more complex (or multidimensional) and yet
   still must be reconciled with the realities of costs to collect
   requisite data. However, conceptual advances in rangeland ecology and
   management and changes in natural resource policies and societal values
   over the past 25 years have facilitated new approaches to monitoring
   that can support rangeland management's diverse information needs.
   Additionally, advances in sensor technologies and remote-sensing
   techniques have broadened the suite of rangeland attributes that can be
   monitored and the temporal and spatial scales at which they can be
   monitored. We review some of the conceptual and technological
   advancements and provide examples of how they have influenced rangeland
   monitoring. We then discuss implications of these developments for
   rangeland management and highlight what we see as challenges and
   opportunities for implementing effective rangeland monitoring. We
   conclude with a vision for how monitoring can contribute to rangeland
   information needs in the future.}},

Title = {{A management experiment reveals the difficulty of altering seedling
   growth and palatable plant biomass by culling invasive deer}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{623-636}},
Abstract = {{Context. There is concern that deer are shifting forests towards
   undesirable trajectories, and culling of deer is often advocated to
   mitigate these impacts. However, culling deer is expensive and sometimes
   controversial. To reliably ascertain whether such action is beneficial,
   management-scale experiments are needed. We conducted a management
   experiment to evaluate the benefits of culling deer in four New Zealand
   forests.
   Aims. Our experiment tested the predictions that culling deer should
   increase (1) canopy tree seedling height relative growth rate (SHRGR),
   and (2) the foliar biomass of understorey species palatable to deer
   (FBP).
   Methods. Each forest was divided into two 3600-ha areas, with deer
   culling randomly assigned to one area. Deer abundances were indexed
   using faecal pellet counts, and forest variables were measured at the
   start and end of the 8-year experiment. Deer were already at low
   abundance in one forest and were not culled there. We used structural
   equation modelling (SEM) with Bayesian variable selection to update our
   a priori graphical forest-deer model with data from all four forests.
   Key results. Deer abundances were significantly reduced in one forest
   but increased or did not change in the other two forests in which deer
   culling occurred. Culling deer did not increase seedling height relative
   growth rate (SHRGR) or the foliar biomass of understorey species
   palatable to deer (FBP) in the three areas subject to deer culling
   compared with the three areas not subject to deer culling. SEM revealed
   no significant relationships between local-scale deer abundance and
   either SHRGR or FBP. Rather, tree basal area and the foliar biomass of
   unpalatable understorey species were important predictors of FBP and
   SHRGR, respectively, in some forests.
   Conclusions. Our study revealed that culling deer, as currently
   practiced by New Zealand land managers, did not generate the desired
   responses in New Zealand forests, possibly due to deer not being culled
   to sufficiently low densities and/or because forest dynamics and abiotic
   drivers determined plant growth more than deer.}},

Abstract = {{Principles underpinning the goals of nature conservation and ecological
   restoration have traditionally involved preventing ecological change or
   restoring ecosystems or populations towards preferred historical states.
   Under global climate change, it is increasingly recognised that this may
   no longer be achievable, but there has been limited debate regarding new
   principles that can help guide goal-setting for nature conservation and
   ecological restoration in dynamic environments. To stimulate such
   debate, we established a framework of human motivations implicit in
   historically focussed nature conservation approaches. We drew on this
   and a literature survey to propose a palette of five principles to guide
   goal-setting for nature conservation and ecological restoration in a
   changing climate. Our framework proposes three broad sets of human
   motivations relevant to nature conservation: (1) basic survival and
   material needs (akin to provisioning and regulating ecosystem services),
   (2) psychological and cultural needs such as a sense of place
   (reflecting cultural ecosystem services), and (3) the need to fulfil
   moral or ethical obligations (e.g. intergenerational and interspecies
   equity). Meeting basic needs for current and future generations is
   supported by a commonly proposed principle to optimise ecological
   processes and functions (Principle 1); which in turn is dependent on
   maintaining the ongoing evolutionary potential in the world's biota
   (Principle 2). Beyond this, motivations relating to psychological,
   cultural and moral needs demand not only an emphasis on healthy
   ecosystem functioning, but on the character and diversity of the
   ecosystems and species that contribute to these functions. Our
   subsequent three principles, minimise native species losses (Principle
   3), maintain the evolutionary character and biogeographic structuring of
   the biota (Principle 4), and maintain wild natural ecosystems (Principle
   5) contribute to these further goals. Although these principles can
   sometimes be conflicting, we argue that by connecting directly with
   underlying motivations, this broader palette will help take us forward
   towards more effective nature conservation in a rapidly changing world.}},

Abstract = {{Land clearing across southern Australia since European settlement has
   fundamentally changed the amount and distribution of native vegetation;
   it has also substantially reduced genetic diversity in plant species
   throughout Australia, especially in agricultural regions. The most
   recent State of the Environment report indicates that Australian
   biodiversity continues to decline. Many approaches to restoration are
   used in Australia including re-establishing plant populations using tube
   stock or by direct seeding. Native seed for these projects is often
   assumed to be plentiful and available for the majority of species we
   wish to restore but these assumptions are rarely true. We also rely on a
   small number of species for the majority of restoration projects despite
   the vast number of species required to fully restore complex plant
   communities. The majority of seed for restoration is still primarily
   collected from native vegetation despite longstanding concerns regarding
   the sustainability of this practice and the globally recognised impacts
   of vegetation fragmentation on seed production and genetic diversity.
   Climate change is also expected to challenge seed production as
   temperatures rise and water availability becomes more limited; changes
   to current planting practices may also be required. Until now native
   seed collection has relied on market forces to build a strong and
   efficient industry sector, but in reality the Australian native seed
   market is primarily driven by Federal, State and Territory funding. In
   addition, unlike other seed-based agri-businesses native seed collection
   lacks national industry standards. A new approach is required to support
   development of the native seed collection and use sector into an
   innovative industry.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic ecosystems are impacted by climate change. However, the level of
   impacts, especially on macroinvertebrates, are not well known, which is
   the goal of this study. Here, three biotic indices were used. The
   Saginaw River Basin, the largest watershed in Michigan was selected for
   this study. Since no know modeling package exists to evaluate the
   impacts of climate change on these biotic indices, a coupled modeling
   approach was proposed. First, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)
   was setup to estimate streamflow and water quality for all stream
   segments. Next, the results from the SWAT model in combination with
   long-term biological monitoring data were used to develop biotic indices
   predictive models using a two-phase approach. An assemblage of 42
   climate scenarios (2040-2060) were obtained from the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration, which are biased corrected and
   statistically downscaled. The dataset provides two extreme
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to account for best (RCP
   4.5) and worst (RCP 8.5) case scenarios. The climate data were
   incorporated in SWAT and biotic indices predictive models to understand
   stream health conditions in the watershed. Results showed that the
   majority of streams have a probability of declining in values of biotic
   indices while streams that currently have excellent conditions are the
   most vulnerable streams to the climate change. This modeling approach
   provides a new mean to link more strongly biota indicators with flow
   regime indicators, which is of prime interest for the implementation of
   ecohydrology principles. (C) 2016 European Regional Centre for

Abstract = {{In the context of global environmental and social change, with

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Abstract = {{Plant growth in cold climates is not limited by carbon assimilation
   (source activity) but rather by reduced carbon investment into new
   tissues (sink limitation). It has been hypothesized that all
   cold-adapted plants face similar growth constraints at low temperature
   mainly associated with the formation of new tissues. To explore the
   thermal limitation of plant tissue formation, we studied root growth and
   anatomical root tissue characteristics in four cold-adapted alpine
   species (Ranunculus glacialis, Rumex alpinus, Tussilago farfara, Poa
   alpina), grown in thermostated soils with a vertical temperature
   gradient approaching 1 degrees C. Above-ground plant organs were exposed
   to typical alpine climate conditions (high solar radiation and cool
   nights) at 2440 m a.s.l. in the Swiss Alps to assure continuous source
   activity. Image-based measurements of root growth (root elongation rates
   at 12-h intervals, RERs) were combined with anatomical examinations in
   thermally constrained root tips as well as with a functional growth
   analysis of entire plants. Temperatures in the range 0.8 to 1.4 degrees
   C were denoted as critically low temperature thresholds for root
   formation across the four species. The RERs per 12 h revealed that roots
   kept extending at low rates at 0.7-1.2 degrees C but cell elongation and
   xylem lignification were clearly inhibited in the terminal zones of root
   tips. Roots exposed to temperatures between 1 and 5 degrees C showed
   strongly reduced elongation rates so that these roots contributed very
   little to the entire root system compared to control roots grown at 10
   degrees C. Hardly any secondary roots were formed at temperatures below
   5 degrees C and total root mass was substantially lower (74 \% reduction
   in comparison to control), also the above-ground biomass was reduced by
   23 \%. Cell elongation and differentiation rather than cell division

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Land-use change is increasingly influenced by complex socioeconomic and
   environmental interactions that transcend spatial, institutional, and
   temporal scales. These interactions challenge classical place-based land
   system analysis and require new analytical approaches equipped for
   tackling processes, flows, and feedbacks over distance. The recently
   proposed telecoupling framework offers interesting perspectives for
   bringing place-based and process-oriented research together in the study
   of land-use change. However, few studies have explored the influence and
   implications of telecouplings in local land-use changes. One reason for
   this is that the framework still faces challenges for application in
   empirical research. Here, we offer a qualitative operationalization of
   the telecoupling framework to explore its relevance and applicability in
   a case of local land-use change. Investigating the case of a recent boom
   in commercial banana cultivation in Luang Namtha Province, Lao PDR, we
   use a grounded empirical approach starting with the observed land-use
   change at the village level. We then trace flows and distal processes
   influencing the conversion to banana cultivation from the perspectives
   and experiences of the local actors involved. The results identify four
   prominent material and immaterial telecouplings at various spatial and
   temporal scales, as well as some potential feedbacks. This complexity
   points to the need for interdisciplinary research because the processes
   involved in creating telecoupled land-use change transcend the
   boundaries of any one discipline. Overall, however, telecoupling
   presents a strong heuristic lens for examining and describing distal
   causal relations in land-use change in a manner that does not favor a
   specific analytical scale or type of interaction.}},

   the spatial subsidies approach to examine ecosystem services provided by
   Mexican free-tailed bats}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Drivers of environmental change in one location can have profound
   effects on ecosystem services and human well-being in distant locations,
   often across international borders. The telecoupling provides a
   conceptual framework for describing these interactions-for example,
   locations can be defined as sending areas (sources of flows of ecosystem
   services, energy, or information) or receiving areas (recipients of
   flows). However, the ability to quantify feedbacks between ecosystem
   change in one area and societal benefits in other areas requires
   analytical approaches. We use spatial subsidies-an approach developed to
   measure the degree to which a migratory species' ability to provide
   services in one location depends on habitat in another location-as an
   example of how telecoupling can be operationalized. Using the cotton
   pest control and ecotourism services of Mexican free-tailed bats as an
   example, we determined that of the 16 states in the United States and
   Mexico where the species resides, three states (Texas, New Mexico, and
   Colorado) are receiving areas, while the rest of the states are sending
   areas. In addition, the magnitude of spatial subsidy can be used as an
   indicator of the degree to which different locations are telecoupled to
   other locations. In this example, the Mexican free-tailed bat ecosystem
   services to cotton production and ecotourism in Texas and New Mexico are
   heavily dependent on winter habitat in four states in central and
   southern Mexico. In sum, spatial subsidies can be used to operationalize
   the telecoupling conceptual framework by identifying sending and
   receiving areas, and by indicating the degree to which locations are
   telecoupled to other locations.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of a new method for assessing resilience in urban aquatic
   social-ecological systems}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Urban aquatic social-ecological systems (SESs) comprise socio-technical
   elements, the built environment and its management, and natural elements
   (water bodies) that provide ecosystem services. Changed hydrology, poor
   stormwater quality, and the modification of water bodies associated with
   urban development brings challenges for maintaining ecosystem services
   provision in an urban aquatic SES. Water sensitive urban design (WSUD)
   has emerged as a form of development that aims to better support the
   provision of ecosystem services. Resilience concepts provide a basis for
   discriminating between WSUD and conventional development approaches.
   Building on an existing decision support system, a new, preliminary
   method for assessing resilience based on the combination of the
   socio-technical capacity (STC) and natural capacity (NC) of urban
   aquatic SESs has been developed. The STC score reflects a multicriteria
   assessment of the characteristics of stormwater infrastructure and
   management. The NC score reflects an assessment of the state and
   trajectory of biophysical attributes of the system associated with the
   provision of ecosystem services. By modeling a series of future urban
   development scenarios in Auckland, New Zealand, the method has been
   shown to discriminate between scenario outcomes within constraints
   associated with the biophysical and built characteristics modeled.
   Results are consistent with key concepts of resilience theory: outcomes
   are grouped in regimes and exhibit hysteresis, with the ability of WSUD
   to improve the state of the system strongly influenced by the presence
   of legacy effects. The method provides a source of additional, valuable
   information that complements other indicators by providing a snapshot of
   the interaction of catchment management effort and outcomes and
   indicating the likely future state of the SES. Recognizing that the
   method is limited to providing a relative assessment of resilience and
   adopts certain simplistic assumptions, further research aims to
   investigate assessment methods that consider other, fundamental
   biophysical and social properties of urban aquatic SESs.}},

   Beagle Channel with regional and global processes that affect
   environmental conservation and social-ecological sustainability}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Human-wildlife dynamics exhibit novel characteristics in the
   Anthropocene, given the unprecedented degree of globalization that has
   increased the linkages between habitats and people across space and
   time. This is largely caused by transnational mobility and migration,
   international labor, resource markets, and trade. Understanding the
   relationship between humans and wildlife, and their associated
   telecoupling processes, helps to promote better management practices and
   governance for reconciling socioeconomic and conservation interests.
   Even remote places on the globe exhibit these features. For example, in
   southern Patagonia's coastal and marine ecosystems, seabirds are not
   only very abundant and charismatic members of the wildlife community,
   nowadays, their colonies are a main tourism attraction of global
   significance, and in the past they were used for consumptive and
   scientific purposes that also linked the ``uttermost ends of the
   Earth{''} with distant places. Thus, in this study, we review
   human-seabird interactions in the iconic Beagle Channel (BC) in the
   Argentine portion of the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago. We adapted and
   employed the coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) approach and
   telecoupling framework to integrate disparate social and biological
   information and obtain a more holistic understanding of current
   human-seabird dynamics and trends in the BC. Although our assessment
   includes the temporal scale of human-seabird relationships, we centered
   the CHANS and telecoupling analysis on the modern seabird-tourism
   interaction, focused on the channel's Argentine sector, in which tourism
   is most intensively developed. Our synthesis of the BC's telecoupled
   CHANS allowed us to recognize the strong historical local-to-global
   interactions between both human and natural subsystems and the sharp
   increase in distance telecoupling during the 20th century. Despite this
   globalizing trend in seabirds connecting the BC's local ecosystems to
   distant places, ironically we found few linkages between Argentina and
   Chile, despite both countries sharing political sovereignty over this
   single biogeographical unit. Recognizing and studying the telecouplings
   identified in this study would help multilateral efforts to incorporate
   the spillover systems (especially with Chile) and sending systems (i.e.,
   transnational tourists' countries of origin) into extant regional
   policies (e.g., state protected areas) and global initiatives (e.g., the
   United Nations' sustainable development goals). It would also enable
   more informed decisions regarding specific proposals based on
   market-based incentives (e.g., payment for ecosystem services),
   certification schemes (e.g., Distintivo Onashaga) and participatory
   approaches (e.g., comanagement of natural resources with local
   communities). Integrating these scales into the management of the BC
   would help ensure that humans continue to enjoy meaningful relationships
   with this unique and charismatic wildlife and at the same time reinforce
   responsible tourism as a local-global strategy for sustainable
   development and global conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate quantification of ecosystem services (ES) at regional scales is
   increasingly important for making informed decisions in the face of
   environmental change. We linked terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem
   process models to simulate the spatial and temporal distribution of
   hydrological and water quality characteristics related to ecosystem
   services. The linked model integrates two existing models (a forest
   ecosystem model and a river network model) to establish consistent
   responses to changing drivers across climate, terrestrial, and aquatic
   domains. The linked model is spatially distributed, accounts for
   terrestrial-aquatic and upstreamdownstream linkages, and operates on a
   daily time-step, all characteristics needed to understand regional
   responses. The model was applied to the diverse landscapes of the Upper
   Merrimack River watershed, New Hampshire, USA. Potential changes in
   future environmental functions were evaluated using statistically
   downscaled global climate model simulations (both a high and low
   emission scenario) coupled with scenarios of changing land cover
   (centralized vs. dispersed land development) for the time period of
   1980-2099. Projections of climate, land cover, and water quality were
   translated into a suite of environmental indicators that represent
   conditions relevant to important ecosystem services and were designed to
   be readily understood by the public. Model projections show that climate
   will have a greater influence on future aquatic ecosystem services
   (flooding, drinking water, fish habitat, and nitrogen export) than
   plausible changes in land cover. Minimal changes in aquatic
   environmental indicators are predicted through 2050, after which the
   high emissions scenarios show intensifying impacts. The spatially
   distributed modeling approach indicates that heavily populated portions
   of the watershed will show the strongest responses. Management of land
   cover could attenuate some of the changes associated with climate change
   and should be considered in future planning for the region.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Resilience thinking appears to offer a holistic approach that can be
   used by social researchers to interpret past and contemporary conditions
   and identify possible futures for social-ecological systems (SES).
   Resilience thinking is shaping contemporary environmental policy and its
   implementation in Australia, Europe, and North America. At the same
   time, social researchers have raised concerns about the limitations of
   resilience thinking, particularly in its handling of human agency, power
   relationships, social thresholds, and the social construction of SES
   definitions. We argue for a reflexive turn in resilience thinking as a
   way to address these concerns. We draw on lessons from three Australian
   case studies where a reflexive application of resilience thinking
   generated insights for research and practice. We propose six areas for
   reflexive inquiry: (1) focal scale and level, (2) SES definition, (3)
   narratives of change, (4) processes of knowledge production, (5) social
   transition trajectories, and (6) social thresholds. In so doing, the
   assumptions of resilience thinking are politicized and problematized,
   which improves its theoretical analytical utility, and in practice
   generates new insights into social processes. Reflexivity offers
   opportunity for greater cross-disciplinary dialogue between resilience
   thinking and the social sciences, while allowing methodologies with
   differing ontologies and epistemologies to be applied in a complementary
   manner.}},

Abstract = {{Future changes in ecosystem services will depend heavily on changes in
   land cover and land use, which, in turn, are shaped by human activities.
   Given the challenges of predicting long-term changes in human behaviors
   and activities, scenarios provide a framework for simulating the
   long-term consequences of land-cover change on ecosystem function. As
   input for process-based models of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem
   function, we developed scenarios for land cover, population density, and
   impervious cover for the state of New Hampshire for 2020-2100. Key
   drivers of change were identified through information gathered from six
   sources: historical trends, existing plans relating to New Hampshire's
   land-cover future, surveys, existing population scenarios, key informant
   interviews with diverse stakeholders, and input from subject-matter
   experts. Scenarios were developed in parallel with information
   gathering, with details added iteratively as new questions emerged. The
   final scenarios span a continuum from spatially dispersed development
   with a low value placed on ecosystem services (Backyard Amenities) to
   concentrated development with a high value placed on ecosystem services
   (the Community Amenities family). The Community family includes two
   population scenarios (Large Community and Small Community), to be
   combined with two scenarios for land cover (Protection of Wildlands and
   Promotion of Local Food), producing combinations that bring the total
   number of scenarios to six. Between Backyard Amenities and Community
   Amenities is a scenario based on linear extrapolations of current trends
   (Linear Trends). Custom models were used to simulate decadal change in
   land cover, population density, and impervious cover. We present raster
   maps and proportion of impervious cover for HUC10 watersheds under each
   scenario and discuss the trade-offs of our translation and modeling
   approach within the context of contemporary scenario projects.}},

Title = {{A framework for modeling adaptive forest management and decision making

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Adapting the management of forest resources to climate change involves
   addressing several crucial aspects to provide a valid basis for decision
   making. These include the knowledge and belief of decision makers, the
   mapping of management options for the current as well as anticipated
   future bioclimatic and socioeconomic conditions, and the ways decisions
   are evaluated and made. We investigate the adaptive management process
   and develop a framework including these three aspects, thus providing a
   structured way to analyze the challenges and opportunities of managing
   forests in the face of climate change. We apply the framework for a
   range of case studies that differ in the way climate and its impacts are
   projected to change, the available management options, and how decision
   makers develop, update, and use their beliefs about climate change
   scenarios to select among adaptation options, each being optimal for a
   certain climate change scenario. We describe four stylized types of
   decision-making processes that differ in how they (1) take into account
   uncertainty and new information on the state and development of the
   climate and (2) evaluate alternative management decisions: the
   ``no-change,{''} the ``reactive,{''} the ``trend-adaptive,{''} and the
   ``forward-looking adaptive{''} decision-making types. Accordingly, we
   evaluate the experiences with alternative management strategies and
   recent publications on using Bayesian optimization methods that account
   for different simulated learning schemes based on varying knowledge,
   belief, and information. Finally, our proposed framework for identifying
   adaptation strategies provides solutions for enhancing forest structure
   and diversity, biomass and timber production, and reducing climate
   change-induced damages. They are spatially heterogeneous, reflecting the
   diversity in growing conditions and socioeconomic settings within

Title = {{Increasing the effectiveness of participatory scenario development

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Developing scenarios to explore possible environmental futures is a
   widely used tool in social-ecological research. Scenario planners
   working in environmental systems increasingly enlist stakeholders to
   help develop scenarios, but effectively integrating stakeholder
   participation with scenario analyses and modeling remains a challenge.
   Using the New England Landscape Futures project as a case study, we
   explore how a method for codesigning a scenario elicitation process can
   be used to help balance the needs of both stakeholders and scientists.
   To illustrate the design process, we document eight influential
   decisions made with stakeholder input, describe the competing demands
   that we negotiated, and outline the rationale for the selected approach.
   We find that three priorities drove most of our decisions: maximizing
   stakeholder involvement in the scenario development process, efficient
   use of stakeholder time, and research needs. The outcome was a robust,
   intense, and highly structured one-day scenario development protocol
   that engaged stakeholders in the full scenario development process from
   initial orientation and identification of driving forces through to
   fleshedout scenarios narratives and quantitative inputs able to inform
   land-use simulations. Its deployment in six state-specific workshops was
   successful in eliciting divergent scenarios that stakeholders perceived
   as being plausible and relevant. Stakeholder responses to the process
   were positive, though also reflected the compromises made during the
   codesign process. Research needs were largely met, though initial
   expectations likely exceeded what could reasonably be elicited from a
   stakeholder group in one day. Our experiences highlight the importance
   of process design and how selection of scenario development techniques
   should follow from the project objectives, problem context, and
   stakeholder preferences for engagement activities. The use of a codesign
   framework that recognizes the challenges involved and engages
   stakeholders in the design process can act as a shared learning
   experience and contribute to greater effectiveness and impact for
   participatory social-ecological scenario processes.}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Although ecosystem services research has become common, few efforts are
   directed toward in-depth understanding of the specific ecological
   quantities people value. The theoretical framework of final ecosystem
   services focuses attention on such measurable attributes, as a common
   currency for social-ecological systems research. Environmental
   communications as well as ecological monitoring and analysis efforts
   could be enhanced through increased documentation of final ecosystem
   services. For example, small changes in the way ecosystems are described
   could strongly influence relevance to the public and improve the
   foundation for environmental decision making. Focusing on rivers and
   streams, we conducted a content analysis of existing publications to
   document the breadth and frequency with which various measurable
   attributes, such as flooding, water quality characteristics, and
   wildlife appeared in different news sources over a multiyear timeline.
   In addition to attributes, motivations for human interest in
   river-related resources were also coded, such as recreation or
   preservation for future generations. To allow testing of differences
   between materials written for different audiences, three sources were
   sampled: a blog hosted by National Geographic, New York Times articles,
   and Wall Street Journal articles. The coding approach was rigorously
   tested in a pilot phase, with measures developed to ensure high data
   quality, including use of two independent coders. Results show numerous
   similarities across sources with some notable differences in emphasis.
   Significant relationships between groups of attribute and motivation
   codes were also found, one outcome of which is further support for the
   importance of nonuse values for fish and wildlife. Besides offering
   insight on ecosystem services, the project demonstrates an in-depth

Title = {{The oak or the reed: how resilience theories are translated into
   disaster management policies}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Although many researchers explore disaster resilience as an ongoing
   process or as a measurable property with indicators, few study whether
   disaster resilience policies are likely to lead to outcomes that are
   adaptive over the longer term. Some measures intended to increase local
   resilience may actually decrease the ability to cope with large-scale
   disasters. In the context of flood management, this work looks at
   activities supported in the name of resilience and whether they will
   result in long-term adaptive outcomes. It is proposed that the
   interpretation of ``resilience{''} in emergency management has been
   influenced by pre-existing disaster management concepts, such as the
   prevent-prepare-respond-recover (PPRR) framework. These have not been
   adequately reassessed in the light of resilience theories. Disaster
   resilience was examined using the PPRR framework as a lens. With a focus
   on flooding, national disaster resilience policy documents from four
   countries and the global arena were studied to find out which activities
   were linked to resilience and whether this varies between countries.
   Subnational policies were also examined in areas that had recently
   experienced major flooding. Resilience interpretations in some countries
   were found to support resistance strategies while others were more
   accommodating. The continued development of floodplains, facilitated by
   structural mitigation, is an example of a highly resilient but
   maladaptive feedback loop. This results in risk accumulation and higher
   consequences during extreme floods. Research explores ways interventions
   could alter feedbacks and transform to more desirable resilience
   regimes. It is proposed that negotiating long-term adaptation pathways
   should be the ultimate aim for planners and emergency managers rather
   than resilience, which tends to support the status quo. Emergency
   management concepts and frameworks need to be amended in the light of
   resilience theories to make it easier to achieve adaptive outcomes.}},

Title = {{Identifying peaks in bat activity: a new application of SaTScan's
   space-time scan statistic}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{392-399}},
Abstract = {{Context. Identifying key spatio-temporal periods of an organism's
   activity is an important focus of many ecological studies. Bat activity,
   as assessed by passive acoustic monitoring, can be extremely variable
   and currently there exists no agreed-upon method for identifying periods
   of high activity.
   Aims. We proposed a new application for the space-time scan statistic
   (SaTScan) as an objective technique for identifying peak periods of bat
   activity. We aimed to test the validity of SaTScan as a method for
   identifying peaks in bat activity and demonstrate its use for assessing
   species-specific temporal patterns of activity.
   Methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of SaTScan for detecting peaks in
   activity, we compared SaTScan to peaks identified with percentile
   thresholds. We evaluated peaks in activity across three scales: within
   nights; among nights at a site; and among sites. We applied SaTScan to
   demonstrate analysis of species-specific activity as further use of this
   technique.
   Key results. SaTScan was effective at identifying peak time periods that
   included the majority of the high activity minutes. Timing of peaks of
   activity was most consistent for Myotis lucifugus during swarming and
   Lasiurus borealis during migration. All other activity for five species
   at three sites was indicative of foraging activity, with peaks in the
   first 5 h after sunset.
   Conclusions. SaTScan can be a valuable tool for quickly identifying
   peaks in acoustic activity of bats, with an objective, replicable and
   statistically sound method that can be applied at many temporal and
   spatial scales.
   Implications. This tool has the potential for many more applications in
   ecology. Beyond acoustic analyses of bat activity, this technique could
   easily identify peaks in a research or management context, such as study
   activity among habitats, commercial developments or years at a single
   site.}},

Abstract = {{The essential biodiversity variables (EBV) framework was developed
   primarily to improve the detection of significant changes in global
   biodiversity. Its application at national level must support
   county-specific policy and management needs as well as allowing
   comparisons of estimates of biodiversity change between countries and
   their aggregation for reporting at regional, continental and global
   scales.
   Here we outline a process for prioritising biodiversity variables at
   national scale using the EBV framework. The process involves separately
   identifying candidate EBVs that are useful for tracking important
   changes in biodiversity in each major ecological feature in each
   ecoregion within a country. The list is then prioritised based on the
   proportion of ecological feature ecoregion combinations using each
   variable within and across terrestrial, marine and freshwater realms.
   We showcased this process in Australian state of New South Wales (NSW)
   using terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecoregions of the world as
   bioregional strata; vegetation formations as terrestrial ecological
   features, and broad aquatic ecosystem types as marine and freshwater
   ecological features. There was sufficient knowledge of ecological
   processes to identify useful variables for 85\% of the ecological
   feature ecoregion combinations in NSW. Eleven candidate EBVs covering
   all six EBV classes, were useful in all three environmental realms.
   Our structured, stepwise approach to variable selection provides a
   transparent process for identifying important elements of ecological
   theory underpinning biodiversity monitoring within countries. Worldwide
   adoption of a process for prioritising biodiversity variables such as
   the one we propose here would help ensure consistency of national
   contributions to global biodiversity assessments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A critical requirement in assessing progress towards global biodiversity
   targets is improving our capacity to measure changes in biodiversity.
   Global biodiversity declined between 2000 and 2010, and there are
   indications that the decline was greater in freshwater than in
   terrestrial or marine systems. However, the data, tools and methods
   available during that decade were inadequate to reliably quantify this
   decline. Recent advances in freshwater monitoring make a global
   assessment now close to becoming feasible. Here we identify priorities
   for freshwater biodiversity assessment for 2020 and 2030, based on the
   Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) framework. We identify 22
   priority activities for 2020 under three of the EBV classes (species
   populations, community composition, and ecosystem structure), which
   include: a globally systematic approach to collecting and assessing
   species data, collating existing and new data within global platforms,
   coordinated effort towards mapping wetland extent at high spatial
   resolution, linking in-situ data to modelling across regions, and
   mobilising citizen science for the collection and verification of data.
   Accomplishing these will allow the state of global biodiversity to be
   assessed according to a Red List Index with expanded geographic and
   taxonomic cover, an improved freshwater Living Planet Index with a
   greater number and phylogenetic range of species, measures of alpha and
   beta diversity, and globally-consistent estimates of wetland extent. To
   assess variables in the other EBV classes (genetic composition, species
   traits, and ecosystem function) we identify 15 priorities, which include
   development of environmental DNA methods, species-traits databases,
   eco-informatics and modelling over the next 15 years. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Designing a solution to enable agency-academic scientific collaboration
   for disasters}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{As large-scale environmental disasters become increasingly frequent and
   more severe globally, people and organizations that prepare for and
   respond to these crises need efficient and effective ways to integrate
   sound science into their decision making. Experience has shown that
   integrating nongovernmental scientific expertise into disaster decision
   making can improve the quality of the response, and is most effective if
   the integration occurs before, during, and after a crisis, not just
   during a crisis. However, collaboration between academic, government,
   and industry scientists, decision makers, and responders is frequently
   difficult because of cultural differences, misaligned incentives, time
   pressures, and legal constraints. Our study addressed this challenge by
   using the Deep Change Method, a design methodology developed by Stanford
   ChangeLabs, which combines human-centered design, systems analysis, and
   behavioral psychology. We investigated underlying needs and motivations
   of government agency staff and academic scientists, mapped the root
   causes underlying the relationship failures between these two
   communities based on their experiences, and identified leverage points
   for shifting deeply rooted perceptions that impede collaboration. We
   found that building trust and creating mutual value between multiple
   stakeholders before crises occur is likely to increase the effectiveness
   of problem solving. We propose a solution, the Science Action Network,
   which is designed to address barriers to scientific collaboration by
   providing new mechanisms to build and improve trust and communication
   between government administrators and scientists, industry
   representatives, and academic scientists. The Science Action Network has
   the potential to ensure cross-disaster preparedness and science-based
   decision making through novel partnerships and scientific coordination.}},

Title = {{The concept of the Anthropocene as a game-changer: a new context for
   social innovation and transformations to sustainability}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{After tracing the antecedents of the concept and considering its
   intersection in social innovation research, we put forward the argument
   that the Anthropocene concept points to three areas of thought that are
   strategically imperative and must be accelerated if social innovation
   theory and practice is to prove transformative and respond to the
   challenges associated with the Anthropocene. First, we contend that the
   current debate on social innovation for sustainability lacks a deeper
   focus on human-environmental interactions and the related feedbacks,
   which will be necessary to understand and achieve large-scale change and
   transformations to global sustainability. Many innovations focus on only
   the social or the ecological, and we believe a more integrated approach
   will be needed moving forward. Second, social innovation research must
   confront the path-dependencies embedded within systems, and we propose
   that the act of ``bricolage,{''} which recombines existing elements in
   novel ways, will be essential, rather than single variable solutions,
   which currently dominate social innovation discussions. Finally, we put
   forward the idea that confronting the cross-scalar nature of the
   Anthropocene requires revisiting both the scope and temporal nature of
   social innovations that are most typically focused upon by scholars and
   funders alike. We believe the concept of the Anthropocene creates new
   opportunities for social innovation scholars to imagine new
   possibilities.}},

Pages = {{138-153}},
Abstract = {{Land use is shaped by human activities. Traditional methods of measuring
   land uses (e.g. surveys and remote sensing techniques) often have
   difficulties in capturing human activities. The near-ubiquitous coverage
   of mobile phones opens up a new way to investigate land use through
   human activities. We propose to analyze land use by characterizing human
   activity patterns based on the aggregated call volume, and apply
   non-negative matrix factorization to identify fundamental behavioral
   classes. Using tower-based call data from Dakar, Senegal, we discover
   two fundamental land use patterns: commercial/business/industrial
   (C/B/I) and residential. Then, the land use of the reception area of
   each cell tower can be inferred based on the weights obtained for each
   basis vector. To evaluate the proposed approach, the results are
   compared with two points-of-interest (POI) data sets obtained from
   OpenStreetMap and Facebook's Graph API. We have found that a majority of
   POIs like embassies, offices, and hotels are located in the predicted
   C/B/I areas; specifically, there is a strong positive correlation
   between estimated land use weights and the number of related POIs.
   Furthermore, we have shown analyzing 24-h call pattern matrix can track
   daily land use changes.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{We use the simulation model Envision to analyze long-term wildfire
   dynamics and the effects of different fuel management scenarios in
   central Oregon, USA. We simulated a 50-year future where fuel management
   activities were increased by doubling and tripling the current area
   treated while retaining existing treatment strategies in terms of
   spatial distribution and treatment type. We modeled forest succession
   using a state-and-transition approach and simulated wildfires based on
   the contemporary fire regime of the region. We tested for the presence
   of temporal trends and overall differences in burned area among four
   fuel management scenarios. Results showed that when the forest was
   managed to reduce fuels it burned less: over the course of 50 years
   there was up to a 40\% reduction in area burned. However, simulation
   outputs did not reveal the expected temporal trend, i.e., area burned
   did not decrease progressively with time, nor did the absence of
   management lead to its increase. These results can be explained as the
   consequence of an existing wildfire deficit and vegetation succession
   paths that led to closed canopy, and heavy fuels forest types that are
   unlikely to burn under average fire weather. Fire (and management)
   remained relatively rare disturbances and, given our assumptions, were
   unable to alter long-term vegetation patterns and consequently unable to
   alter long-term wildfire dynamics. Doubling and tripling current
   management targets were effective in the near term but not sustainable
   through time because of a scarcity of stands eligible to treat according
   to the modeled management constraints. These results provide new
   insights into the long-term dynamics between fuel management programs
   and wildfire and demonstrate that treatment prioritization strategies
   have limited effect on fire activity if they are too narrowly focused on
   particular forest conditions.}},

Title = {{The role of law in adaptive governance}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{The term ``governance{''} encompasses both governmental and
   nongovernmental participation in collective choice and action. Law
   dictates the structure, boundaries, rules, and processes within which
   governmental action takes place, and in doing so becomes one of the
   focal points for analysis of barriers to adaptation as the effects of
   climate change are felt. Adaptive governance must therefore contemplate
   a level of flexibility and evolution in governmental action beyond that
   currently found in the heavily administrative governments of many
   democracies. Nevertheless, over time, law itself has proven highly
   adaptive in western systems of government, evolving to address and even
   facilitate the emergence of new social norms (such as the rights of
   women and minorities) or to provide remedies for emerging problems (such
   as pollution). Thus, there is no question that law can adapt, evolve,
   and be reformed to make room for adaptive governance. In doing this, not
   only may barriers be removed, but law may be adjusted to facilitate
   adaptive governance and to aid in institutionalizing new and emerging
   approaches to governance. The key is to do so in a way that also
   enhances legitimacy, accountability, and justice, or else such reforms
   will never be adopted by democratic societies, or if adopted, will
   destabilize those societies. By identifying those aspects of the
   frameworks for adaptive governance reviewed in the introduction to this
   special feature relevant to the legal system, we present guidelines for
   evaluating the role of law in environmental governance to identify the
   ways in which law can be used, adapted, and reformed to facilitate
   adaptive governance and to do so in a way that enhances the legitimacy
   of governmental action.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Resilient communities promote trust, have well-developed networks, and
   can adapt to change. For rural communities in fire-prone landscapes,
   current resilience strategies may prove insufficient in light of
   increasing wildfire risks due to climate change. It is argued that,
   given the complexity of climate change, adaptations are best addressed
   at local levels where specific social, cultural, political, and economic
   conditions are matched with local risks and opportunities. Despite the
   importance of social networks as key attributes of community resilience,
   research using social network analysis on coupled human and natural
   systems is scarce. Furthermore, the extent to which local communities in
   fire-prone areas understand climate change risks, accept the likelihood
   of potential changes, and have the capacity to develop collaborative
   mitigation strategies is underexamined, yet these factors are imperative
   to community resiliency. We apply a social network framework to examine
   information networks that affect perceptions of wildfire and climate
   change in Central Oregon. Data were collected using a mailed
   questionnaire. Analysis focused on the residents' information networks
   that are used to gain awareness of governmental activities and measures
   of community social capital. A two-mode network analysis was used to
   uncover information exchanges. Results suggest that the general public
   develops perceptions about climate change based on complex social and
   cultural systems rather than as patrons of scientific inquiry and
   understanding. It appears that perceptions about climate change itself
   may not be the limiting factor in these communities' adaptive capacity,
   but rather how they perceive local risks. We provide a novel
   methodological approach in understanding rural community adaptation and
   resilience in fire-prone landscapes and offer a framework for future

Pages = {{310-314}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The northeastern United States is currently experiencing a decline in
   forested lands, primarily due to the expansion of human development Of
   particular concern is the loss of ``core areas{''} or the areas within
   forests that are not influenced by other land cover types. Core areas
   are of significant importance to native flora and fauna, since they
   generally are less vulnerable to invasion by exotics and are more
   resilient to the effects of climate change. However, the exact reduction
   of core area in the northeast is still unknown. Current methods of
   estimation are not particularly precise, since areas of edge influence
   are quite variable and situational. Therefore, the purpose of this study
   is to devise a new method for identifying edge influence areas using
   remote sensing techniques. Eight transects were sampled perpendicular to
   the edge of an abandoned golf course within Harvard Forest in Petersham,
   MA. Vegetation inventories as well as Photosynthetically Active
   Radiation (PAR) at different heights within the canopy were used to
   determine edge depth in the field. Small-footprint discrete aerial LiDAR
   datasets were comparatively used to identify edge depths. LiDAR returns
   were binned and transformed into canopy height profiles before the sum
   of squared differences was used to determine where edge influence
   diminished, creating a LiDAR derived edge depth. LiDAR estimated edge
   depths were not significantly different from the field identified edge
   depths, indicating it might be a low-cost method for estimating edge
   depths. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Growing attention to novel and designed ecosystems, and the confusion
   that follows from the overlap of these distinct ecosystem approaches,
   risks a loss of focus on ecological values at the core of restoration
   ecology. Novel ecosystems originate in ecosystems that are transformed
   beyond which the practical efforts of conventional restoration are
   feasible. They are also self-sustaining in the sense that they take time
   to form, and do not typically receive regular management. In this
   respect, they arise differently than designed ecosystems, which are
   assembled with specific goals in mind and are often heavily managed.
   Designed (or engineered) ecosystems comprise a variety of ecological
   approaches including reclamation (return a degraded ecosystem to
   productive capacity), green infrastructure, and agroecological systems.
   There are three elements that distinguish novel and designed ecosystems.
   Designed ecosystems typically require intensive intervention to create
   them, and ongoing management to sustain them; novel ecosystems do not.
   Second, the human intentions behind designed and novel ecosystems are
   usually different. Designed ecosystems exist in the service of human
   interests, including specific services (e.g. filtration, cooling, nature
   appreciation), aesthetics, and shifting value commitments toward green
   infrastructure; novel ecosystems arise typically through inadvertent
   human activity. Third, designed and novel ecosystems have different
   developmental pathways. Historical ecosystems are the starting point for
   restored, hybrid, and novel ecosystems; designed ecosystems are
   intentionally created. Designed ecosystems stand apart as providing a
   new origin for ecosystems of the future, including those that become
   novel ecosystems.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{82-91}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Restoring the flooding-related disturbance regime by removing and
   setting back flood defenses (channel widening) is the most efficient
   strategy for recovering riparian plant communities in floodplains
   formerly impacted by human activities such as agriculture, mining, and
   forestry. Removing flood defenses is generally not socially accepted,
   and alternative recovery strategies must be explored. We assessed
   vegetation establishment on 33 sites in the floodplains of the Middle
   Ebro River and three of its tributaries (NE Spain) where restoration
   approaches applied in the last 20 years include channel widening,
   floodplain excavation, and abandonment of agriculture, gravel
   extraction, and hybrid poplar plantations, with and without plantation
   of native species. Using analysis of similarity and ordinations, we
   found that channel widening led to plant communities closely resembling
   those found on natural gravel bars, including new recruits of keystone
   tree species. Excavation of the floodplain as the restoration approach
   resulted in pioneer, non-strictly riparian communities. Abandonment of
   agricultural land or clearing of poplar plantations resulted in
   alternative stable states predominating, regardless of time elapsed
   since restoration and whether poles of native species were planted.
   However, forest-like communities relatively similar to mature, natural
   riparian references were attainable when hybrid poplars were allowed to
   resprout after clear-cutting, or after the human activities were
   abandoned and trees were not cut. Combining channel widening and
   assisted revegetation where flood defenses cannot be altered may
   partially reproduce a mosaic of habitats typical of natural floodplains.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{28-39}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Questions: Californian grasslands have a long history of invasion,
   starting with the introduction of exotic forage species a century ago,
   and followed by newer waves of invaders. Both exotic and invasive
   species produce large amounts of litter, but the importance of litter
   accumulation on the growth and expansion of these species has not been
   rigorously assessed. We addressed the following questions: (1) do litter
   type (exotic or invasive species) and litter quantity affect exotic and
   invasive plant performance; (2) at which plant life stages does litter
   accumulation effects occur; and (3) is litter accumulation impacting
   native species recruitment and diversity?
   Location: Semi-natural grasslands, northern California.
   Methods: We created litter quantity gradients (0, 62.5, 125, 250 or 500
   g.m(-2)) of three litter types (exotic or invasive species litter or a
   mixture of both). We evaluated litter effects on the germination,
   recruitment, production of flowers and biomass production of the exotic
   Avena fatua, the invasive Elymus caput-medusae and a mixture of native
   species. We used litter depth as a proxy for litter accumulation and
   measured litter impacts on light availability at ground level,
   soilmoisture, soil andmicrobial C and N.
   Results: We found a significant litter depth impact on all species, but
   no litter type effects. Litter accumulation principally reduced light
   availability at ground level and positively affected exotic and invasive
   species at different life-history stages. Above-ground biomass
   production of the exotic species Avena increased with increased litter
   depth, suggesting a litter accumulation feedback. The invasive species
   Elymus responded to increased litter with increased seed production,
   rather than biomass production. In contrast, litter negatively affected
   the recruitment and diversity of native species.
   Conclusion: Overall, our findings point to cascading effects in invasion
   with positive litter accumulation feedbacks of an exotic species
   simultaneously reducing native diversity and promoting seed production
   of a more recent invasive arrival. These results have strong
   consequences for invasion management and suggest that litter removal
   practices, such as burning and grazing, would better succeed at limiting
   the growth and spread of invasive species than herbicide application or
   seeding.}},

Abstract = {{There is mounting evidence that many taxa respond in non-linear ways to
   perturbation (i.e. deviations from a natural trajectory brought on by an
   external agent), and many statistical, physical and ecological methods
   have been developed to detect the critical points or thresholds of
   perturbation. The majority of these methods define thresholds as the
   perturbation points causing abrupt ecological response, but in reality
   most species or ecosystems do not show a break point response but more
   gradual transitional change to perturbation. We develop a new method
   which delineates thresholds as a region in which the slope of the
   relationship between ecological response (y) and perturbation (x; e.g.
   habitat loss) is larger than 1: vertical bar|dy/dx vertical bar >= 1,
   where both x-and y-axes are scaled to (0, 1) range. The lower end of
   threshold zones so defined is of particular ecological interest because
   it is the smallest x that may trigger impending catastrophic response to
   a small change in x. We derived two landscape models (edge length and
   the number of patches of species distribution) and two biodiversity
   models (endemics-area relationship and half-population curve) to test
   this method. We applied our zonal thresholding method to these four
   models fit to empirical data of two forest plots to detect thresholds of
   species distribution to habitat loss. The two landscape metric models
   predict that no species could tolerate more than 40\% of habitat loss
   and these thresholds can be much lower for relatively rare species with
   occupancy <0.4 and for aggregated habitat loss compared to random
   habitat loss. The half-population model leads to a similar threshold
   level of 40\% habitat loss. Overall, we suggest the maximum permissible
   habitat loss threshold to be between 0-40\%, depending on the
   pre-disturbed occupancy (or abundance) of a species. This habitat loss
   threshold falls within the otherwise wide range of thresholds calculated
   from conventional methods. Our study contributes novel methods and
   models to quantify the effect of habitat loss on species distribution
   and diversity in landscapes with potential for conservation
   applications.}},

Title = {{Spatial variation in Allee effects influences patterns of range
   expansion}},
Journal = {{ECOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{179-188}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Allee effects are thought to slow range expansion and contribute to
   stable range boundaries. Recent studies have shown Allee effects to vary
   spatiotemporally due to influences of environmental heterogeneity on
   population processes. Gradients in Allee effects might occur as a
   species' range approaches suboptimal conditions while expanding into new
   territory. Allee effects could exhibit patchiness if drivers of positive
   density dependence (e.g. mate finding rates) are influenced by habitat
   patchiness. However, theoretical studies have largely assumed Allee
   effects to be spatially constant. The goal of this study was to evaluate
   how spatiotemporal patterns of range expansion respond to spatial
   variations in Allee effects. We simulated spread in landscapes that
   differed in the spatial configuration and range of Allee thresholds. We
   compared spread with a constant Allee effect to spread in landscapes
   where the Allee threshold varied along a gradient or in a patchy
   fashion. Landscape configuration affected patterns of range expansion
   when Allee thresholds were near or exceeded the number of colonizing
   immigrants. In gradient landscapes, spread decelerated as the range edge
   approached higher Allee thresholds. In patchy landscapes, spread
   advanced quickly through areas with lower Allee thresholds and stalled
   in areas with higher Allee thresholds. Both focal and neighboring
   locations influenced spread. Spatial variation in Allee effects may be
   an underappreciated source of heterogeneity in patterns of range
   expansion. When Allee effects vary, spread estimates based on a
   spatially averaged Allee threshold may not accurately predict realized
   rates of spread. Our findings suggest that spread can occur despite
   generally high Allee thresholds if Allee thresholds are low in a subset
   of patches. This result has negative implications for controlling the
   spread of invasive species, but it also suggests range shifts by native
   species in response to climate change may be possible with even sparsely
   distributed refugia from Allee effects.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patterns of change in ecomorphological traits have
   traditionally been studied using data from the fossil record. Recent
   advances in molecular phylogenetics created new opportunities for
   inferring ancestral character states and estimating the modes and rates
   of trait evolution from phylogenetic hypotheses of extant organisms.
   However, without fossil taxa useful information is potentially discarded
   and, in the worst case, results from extant taxa only may be misleading,
   in particular if extinction rates have been high and directional
   selection has acted.
   Question: How does the integration of fossil information affect our
   understanding of macro-evolutionary dynamics?
   Organisms: Extant species of the superfamily Musteloidea (Carnivora -
   weasels and allies); extinct lineages of this clade (c. 30 to 2 Ma)
   sampled predominantly throughout the northern hemisphere.
   Experiments: We focus on the evolutionary dynamics of carnivoran
   ecometric traits (three index ratios associated with locomotor habit and
   posture calculated from the osteological measurements), and we highlight
   the impact of using extant-only phylogenies versus integrated analyses
   when evaluating modes and rates of trait evolution.
   Methods: We integrated extinct taxa into a molecular phylogeny of the
   extant species based on taxonomic knowledge (association with a
   particular family/subfamily) and sampling from the estimated times of
   speciation and extinction of each fossil lineage. We repeated the
   procedure for each of 500 trees from the posterior distribution of a
   Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. We compared the fit of different
   macroevolutionary models (Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,
   accelerating/decelerating evolution, and Brownian motion with a
   directional trend) for all trees (with and without fossils), using AIC
   regression.
   Results: The integration of fossil data into the analyses of trait
   evolution significantly affected model selection, evolutionary rates, as
   well as estimated trait values at the root of the phylogeny. In the case
   of the metatarsal III-to-femur ratio, the integrated analyses provided
   strong support for a Trend model, whereas the different
   macroevolutionary models could not be distinguished with strong
   statistical support when only extant taxa were considered. Furthermore,
   our analyses indicated substantial variation of evolutionary rates
   across the phylogeny, with high rates of evolution of locomotor traits
   along the backbone of the Mustelidae tree and within the Lutrinae clade
   in particular, reconciling complex evolutionary dynamics with more
   realistic root node estimates than obtained under the Trend model. Thus,
   the integration of fossils and molecular data has implications not only
   for our interpretation of evolutionary dynamics, but also for ancestral
   character reconstructions. Importantly, even in cases where extant-only
   and integrated analyses are in agreement, fossils remain essential
   because they provide additional support for inferred patterns of trait
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The mesosphytic forests of eastern North America represent a forest
   region characterized by dramatic 20th century changes in disturbance
   regimes, notably the exclusion of fire. Tree-ring reconstructions of
   forest disturbance can inform restoration and management plans by
   placing these changes into a historical context. This study examined
   forest disturbance with regard to land use change and drought in the New
   River Gorge region of West Virginia. I developed a 182-year pitch pine
   (Pinus rigida) growth chronology (1833-2014) using samples collected
   from 33 trees along 2 km of south-and southwest-facing slopes at Babcock
   State Park. Samples cut from fire-scarred pitch and Virginia pine (Pinus
   virginiana) were used to generate a fire chronology for the site.
   Temporal trends in pitch pine growth variability were assessed using
   regime shift and growth release detection methods. There was no change
   in pitch pine growth during the transition from the early settlement to
   industrial era (ca. 1885), while a significant decrease in annual growth
   variability characterized the post-industrial era (1963-2014). Seventeen
   fire events were recorded between 1887 and 1968. Growth releases
   displayed a temporal relationship with fire and there was a strong, but
   not significant, association between drought and fire years. These
   results suggest a coupled system in which anthropogenic fires driven by
   periodic drought maintained pitch pine before and during
   industrialization. Reintroducing fire to the post-industrial forest may
   not meet management objectives as decades of fire exclusion have altered
   forest fuels and species composition such that its effects would be
   difficult to predict.}},

   nutrient and sediment gradients for limit setting}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{469-484}},
Abstract = {{The setting of numeric instream objectives (effects-based criteria) and
   catchment limits for major agricultural stressors, such as nutrients and
   fine sediment, is a promising policy instrument to prevent or reduce
   degradation of stream ecosystem health. We explored the suitability of
   assemblage thresholds, defined as a point at which a small increase in a
   stressor will result in a disproportionally large change in assemblage
   structure relative to other points across the stressor gradient, to
   inform instream nutrient and sediment objectives. Identification and
   comparison of thresholds for macroinvertebrate, periphyton, and
   bacterial assemblages aimed at making the setting of objectives more
   robust and may further provide a better understanding of the underlying
   mechanisms of nutrient and fine sediment effects. Gradient forest, a
   novel approach to assemblage threshold identification based on
   regression-tree-based random forest models for individual taxa, allowed
   inclusion of multiple predictors to strengthen the evidence of cause and
   effect between stressors and multispecies responses. The most prominent
   macroinvertebrate and periphyton assemblage threshold across the
   nitrogen (N) gradient was located at very low levels and mainly
   attributed to declines of multiple taxa. This provided strong evidence
   for stream assemblages being significantly affected when N
   concentrations exceed reference conditions and for effects cascading
   through the ecosystem. The most prominent macroinvertebrate assemblage
   threshold across a gradient of suspended fine sediment was also located
   at very low levels and attributed to declines of multiple taxa. However,
   this threshold did not correspond with periphyton assemblage thresholds,
   suggesting that the sensitivity of macroinvertebrate assemblages is
   unrelated to sediment effects on periphyton assemblages. Overall, the
   spectrum of N concentrations and fine sediment levels within which these
   stream assemblages changed most dramatically were relatively narrow
   given the wide gradients tested. We conclude that assemblage thresholds
   can inform the setting of generic instream nutrient and sediment
   objectives for stream ecosystem health. For example, the most stringent
   objective for instream N concentration should be set at values similar
   to reference concentrations for full protection of sensitive taxa or
   overall stream biodiversity. To avoid severe degradation of stream
   biodiversity, the least stringent N objective should stay well below the
   point where significant turnover subsided.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Connectivity is essential to organisms for dispersal, mate finding, and
   resource access. Management conflicts may arise if the attempts to
   maintain connectivity in the face of habitat loss result in opening up
   dispersal corridors to invasive species and disease vectors to
   already-threatened native species. Using the mule deer (Odocoileus
   hemionus) and American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) as examples in
   a network of surface waters in the Sonoran Desert, we illustrate and
   propose a resolution to these conflicts. We used structural and
   functional metrics from graph and circuit theory to quantify landscape
   connectivity within a spatially nested framework under current and
   future climate-based scenarios at regional and local scales to project
   structural and functional climate impacts for both species. Results
   indicated that climate impacts may reduce both structural and functional
   potential connectivity for each species. Mule deer, however, will be
   impacted to a lesser degree, and the proposed management mitigation of
   exclusion areas will have a potential lesser impact on this species.
   From our results, we propose a method to create exclusion areas and site
   new waters to help mitigate increasing spread of invasive species like
   the bullfrog while maintaining resource availability and local
   connectivity for economically important species like the mule deer. The
   isolation of local clusters from invasive species may be a successful
   and useful way to reduce management conflicts in the Sonoran Desert

Abstract = {{Alteration of natural river flow regimes is a major threat to freshwater
   biodiversity. Restoration of natural flow regimes requires an
   understanding of linked hydrological and ecological processes. In this
   study, we investigated how annual seasonal flow characteristics and
   physical habitat attributes could interact to explain yearly changes in
   brown trout population densities (for 0+ fish, corresponding to the
   young of the year, and for the >0+ age class) in 112 sites widespread in
   France. Using an information theoretic approach and general linear
   modeling, we identified the physical habitat attributes and seasonal
   hydrological variables which explained 0+ proportion, total, >0+ and 0+
   brown trout density dynamics. A decrease in total and 0+ brown trout
   densities were mainly linked to high water levels in both high and low
   flows during the emergence period and to a lesser extent, to physical
   habitat attributes reflecting the river size. 0+ proportions were only
   linked to the level of low flows, and to a lesser extent to high flows,

Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{23-33}},
Abstract = {{Effective biodiversity conservation in lowland New Zealand requires an
   understanding of the relative benefits of managing impacts of native
   forest loss versus controlling invasive species. We used bird count data
   from 195 locations across mainland northern New Zealand to examine how
   the abundance and richness of native forest birds varied across wide
   gradients of native forest cover (c. 0-100\%) and intensity of invasive
   species control (`eradication', `high-intensity rat and possum',
   `low-intensity rat and possum', `periodic possum' and `none'). Most
   response variables were significantly affected by forest cover, and this
   effect was typically non-linear: response variables declined rapidly
   below c. 5-10\% forest cover, but were relatively invariant to forest
   cover above this point. Pest control was found to affect surprisingly
   few species, with only kereru (Herniphaganovaeseelandiae) and tui
   (Prosthemadera novaeseel andiae) being more abundant at pest controlled
   than uncontrolled sites for any pest control category. Species richness
   and `total abundance' (abundance of all species combined) also increased
   at pest controlled sites, but effects were largely driven by responses
   `of tui and kereru. Effects of eradication were far larger than effects
   of other pest control categories, while it was unclear whether
   `low-intensity rat and possum' or `periodic possum' control had any
   effects at all. Our results suggest that both managing levels of forest
   cover and controlling invasive mammals can benefit native forest birds,
   but the occurrence and magnitude of these benefits will be
   context-dependent. Managing forest cover may be relatively unimportant
   in landscapes with >5-10\% forest cover, while benefits of pest control
   may be limited unless intensive methods are used. Moreover, even
   intensive pest control may only benefit a small subset of species unless
   coupled with reintroduction of locally-extinct species. Combining these
   results with knowledge of the financial, ethical, and social constraints
   of different management options should provide a solid foundation for
   effective conservation decision-making in lowland environments.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{75-87}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{AimLek-mating species, in which males congregate to display and copulate
   with females, are of long-standing behavioural, economic and
   conservation interest. Monitoring programs often target areas in which
   these species aggregate for mating (lek arenas) because of the often
   cryptic behaviours of these species when away from lek arenas. Due to
   survey methodologies and the ecology of many lek-mating species, the
   building of species distribution models (SDMs) requires researchers to
   consider issues that are generally absent when modelling distributions
   of non-lek-mating species. We describe these considerations and
   illustrate the advantages of employing dynamic SDMs to address
   non-equilibrium between a lek-mating species (Lesser Prairie-Chicken
   Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) and its environment.
   LocationNew Mexico, U.S.A.
   MethodsWe employed a 27-year data set of 2771 lek surveys from a T.
   pallidicinctus metapopulation to build dynamic SDMs using multi-season
   occupancy modelling. We considered covariates (1) indexing past
   abundance and distribution patterns expected to influence dispersal and
   local persistence, (2) describing landscape and weather dynamics
   expected to influence local recruitment, and (3) describing survey-level
   conditions expected to influence lek attendance.
   ResultsThe most supported dynamic SDM indicated an overall decline in
   occurrence and an ending distribution more restricted to the northern
   part of the 1222km(2) study area. Local colonization was best predicted
   by weather and landscape dynamics, while local extinction was best
   predicted by population processes and weather.
   Main conclusionsConservation of T. pallidicinctus will likely face
   challenges from (1) the reduced likelihood of colonization in areas of
   historical shrub-targeting herbicide application and (2) projected
   patterns of seasonal temperature and precipitation under climate change.
   In considering lek-mating species in general, we recommend the use of
   dynamic SDMs for an improved understanding of factors influencing
   distributions through time. Our approach and related efforts represent
   an important step in forecasting distributions under projected scenarios
   of environmental change to assist the conservation of these species.}},

Abstract = {{Canopy transpiration (E-C) is a large fraction of evapotranspiration,
   integrating physical and biological processes within the energy, water,
   and carbon cycles of forests. Quantifying E-C is of both scientific and
   practical importance, providing information relevant to questions
   ranging from energy partitioning to ecosystem services, such as primary
   productivity and water yield. We estimated E-C of four pine stands
   differing in age and growing on sandy soils. The stands consisted of two
   wide-ranging conifer species: Pinus taeda and Pinus sylvestris, in
   temperate and boreal zones, respectively. Combining results from these
   and published studies on all soil types, we derived an approach to
   estimate daily E-C of pine forests, representing a wide range of
   conditions from 35 degrees S to 64 degrees N latitude. During the
   growing season and under moist soils, maximum daily E-C (E-Cm) at
   day-length normalized vapor pressure deficit of 1 kPa (ECm-ref)
   increased by 0.55 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE) mm/d for each unit increase of
   leaf area index (L) up to L = similar to 5, showing no sign of
   saturation within this range of quickly rising mutual shading. The
   initial rise of E-Cm with atmospheric demand was linearly related to
   ECm-ref. Both relations were unaffected by soil type. Consistent with
   theoretical prediction, daily E-C was sensitive to decreasing soil
   moisture at an earlier point of relative extractable water in loamy than
   sandy soils. Our finding facilitates the estimation of daily E-C of
   wide-ranging pine forests using remotely sensed L and meteorological
   data. We advocate an assembly of worldwide sap flux database for further
   evaluation of this approach.}},

Abstract = {{Many factors may affect daily nest survival. We present a novel
   multi-state, multi-stage model to estimate daily survival for each nest
   stage, daily hatching probability and probability that a failed nest
   died during a specific stage when stage of failure is unknown. The model
   does not require that hatching date be known. We used data from a large
   citizen science dataset to demonstrate the application of this approach,
   exploring the impact of laying dates, weather conditions, conserved soil
   moisture, soil carbon, habitat type and urbanization on failure rates of
   common blackbird (Turdus merula) nests. Models selected and estimates of
   nest success were similar to those of the simpler logistic exposure
   method, but accounted for additional uncertainty. Simulations suggest
   the multi-state approach performs better when incubation mortality is
   affected by nest age, but not when incubation mortality is assumed
   constant. Both approaches worked best when date of incubation initiation
   was known for all nests first visited during the incubation stage. Daily
   blackbird survival probabilities were higher in human rural habitat than
   in urban or countryside habitats supporting the hypothesis that these
   intermediate habitats offer a better balance between low food
   availability in urban areas and high predation rates in the wider
   countryside. Nest success was influenced more by recent precipitation in
   urban habitats, but by a longer-term measure of water availability, soil
   moisture, in non-human dominated habitats, indicating that climatic
   change is likely to alter relationships between habitat and breeding
   success (and their temporal scale) by influencing the trade-off between
   food availability and predation rates. The multi-state, multi-stage
   model developed here may be helpful to other researchers modelling
   ecological processes in which transition probabilities between multiple

Abstract = {{1. Assessing the conservation status of protected species needs
   quantitative population data, generally obtained using
   Capture-Mark-Recapture methods (CMR). The exploitation of natural
   marking (e.g. individual morphological traits) offers an interesting
   alternative, based on image analyses, which may result in a less
   manipulation of protected species compared to the typical artificial
   marking method.
   2. In our 2-year CMR study, we tested for the first time in the natural
   setting the feasibility and the application of the computer-aided
   photographic identification method of Rosalia alpina using the
   individual elytral spots as the natural marking. The (ISC)-S-3 software
   was used for the photographic analysis.
   3. Data were collected from populations of two National Parks of central
   Italy during July-August in 2014 and 2015. We developed a standard
   procedure in order to optimise the image acquisition in the field and to
   acquire clear and comparable images, facilitating the (ISC)-S-3
   screening process.
   4. The results demonstrated that the computer-aided photographic
   identification of natural markings can be implemented in a CMR
   population study of R. alpina. Our image processing approach showed that
   using only the elytral central spot contours made the tracing contour
   process less time-consuming obtaining reliable results. Furthermore,
   (ISC)-S-3 output scores were used to identify a threshold value for the
   identification of new individuals or recaptures, facilitating the final
   identification proposed by operators.
   5. Finally, we assessed the possibility of performing the methodology
   using a Citizen Science approach.}},

Title = {{Reducing soil fertility to enable ecological restoration: A new method
   to test the efficacy of Full-Inversion Tillage}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{257-263}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Ecological restoration of high-quality, semi-natural communities of
   conservation value on ex-arable soils with raised fertility has been a
   major problem in northern Europe. One suggested way of tackling this
   problem is to use Full-Inversion Tillage (FIT) where the fertile
   top-soil is moved below infertile subsurface layers. This should provide
   infertile conditions at least in the short- to medium-term for the
   establishment of communities that require these conditions. Here, we
   pioneer a rigorous test of the efficacy of this approach. Our new
   method, using Principal Response Curves (PRCs), overcomes the difficulty
   in testing for change in soil physico-chemical properties down soil
   profiles with the inherent problem of autocorrelations between soil
   layers. Principal Response Curves (PRCs) is a multivariate technique,
   usually used to test for effects of treatment effects through time on a
   community matrix. We propose an extension of their use for the
   multivariate analysis of properties down a soil-depth profile. We tested
   the effects of FIT in two contrasting soils, before and after treatment.
   In a clay loam soil, FIT was effective in reducing the soil fertility in
   the surface 12 cm. Indeed the soil available P concentration, a key
   variable, was more than halved in the surface layers, and was below the
   lowest literature target threshold for the establishment of semi-natural
   grassland. In contrast, in the sandy soil, soil properties increased
   throughout the profile after FIT, primarily because of the pre-treatment
   nutrient distribution within the soil. Before FIT treatment, the maximum
   concentrations of most measured variables were at mid-depth and FIT
   redistributed these to the surface and bottom layers. Our results
   demonstrate the potential for FIT in ecological restoration, but
   indicate that its efficacy depends on soil type and the site history. We
   recommend that in future a pre-treatment assessment of soil properties
   with depth is undertaken before FIT is implemented, and that afterwards
   our PRC approach can be used to test efficacy immediately after
   treatment, and has the potential for measuring soil resilience to
   perturbation through time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Accounting for genetic differences among unknown parents in
   microevolutionary studies: how to include genetic groups in quantitative
   genetic animal models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{7-20}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Quantifying and predicting microevolutionary responses to
   environmental change requires unbiased estimation of quantitative
   genetic parameters in wild populations. `Animal models', which utilize
   pedigree data to separate genetic and environmental effects on
   phenotypes, provide powerful means to estimate key parameters and have
   revolutionized quantitative genetic analyses of wild populations.
   2. However, pedigrees collected in wild populations commonly contain
   many individuals with unknown parents. When unknown parents are
   non-randomly associated with genetic values for focal traits, animal
   model parameter estimates can be severely biased. Yet, such bias has not
   previously been highlighted and statistical methods designed to minimize
   such biases have not been implemented in evolutionary ecology.
   3. We first illustrate how the occurrence of non-random unknown parents
   in population pedigrees can substantially bias animal model predictions
   of breeding values and estimates of additive genetic variance, and
   create spurious temporal trends in predicted breeding values in the
   absence of local selection. We then introduce `genetic group' methods,
   which were developed in agricultural science, and explain how these
   methods can minimize bias in quantitative genetic parameter estimates
   stemming from genetic heterogeneity among individuals with unknown
   parents.
   4. We summarize the conceptual foundations of genetic group animal
   models and provide extensive, step-by-step tutorials that demonstrate
   how to fit such models in a variety of software programs. Furthermore,
   we provide new functions in R that extend current software capabilities
   and provide a standardized approach across software programs to
   implement genetic group methods.
   5. Beyond simply alleviating bias, genetic group animal models can
   directly estimate new parameters pertaining to key biological processes.
   We discuss one such example, where genetic group methods potentially
   allow the microevolutionary consequences of local selection to be
   distinguished from effects of immigration and resulting gene flow.
   6. We highlight some remaining limitations of genetic group models and
   discuss opportunities for further development and application in
   evolutionary ecology. We suggest that genetic group methods should no
   longer be overlooked by evolutionary ecologists, but should become
   standard components of the toolkit for animal model analyses of wild
   population data sets.}},

Title = {{Pervasive human-mediated large-scale invasion: analysis of spread
   patterns and their underlying mechanisms in 17 of China's worst invasive
   plants}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{85-94}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Biological invasions constitute a major component of human-induced
   environmental change and have become a world-wide problem threatening
   global biodiversity and incurring massive economic costs. Consequently,
   research on biological invasions proliferates, placing a major emphasis
   on species traits and habitat characteristics associated with successful
   invasion. Yet, the mechanisms underlying rapid spread and the resulting
   patterns remain largely unexplored.
   2. Using data collected since 1980 and earlier at the county level all
   over China, we studied the contribution of potential dispersal vectors -
   railroads, rail stations, roads, general human activity, rivers and
   winds - to the spread of 17 of China's worst invasive plant species.
   Focusing on long-distance dispersal events, we calculated the minimal
   arrival speed for the first record of each species in each county. We
   also developed and applied a new method to account for observation bias
   due to the proximity to roads, using observational data of 776 native
   (non-invasive) plant species throughout China.
   3. We found that human-related vectors are accountable for the vast
   spread of all 17 invasive plant species we examined. Spread patterns
   were characterized by long jumps of tens to hundreds of kilometres and
   extremely fast average spread rates of roughly 2-4 km per year, and a
   very broad range (0.1-128.2 km per year) with high variability between
   years. These rates are much higher than those expected from classic
   dispersal vectors such as water, wind or animals. Commonly used
   fat-tailed dispersal kernels did not fit the observed distribution of
   long jumps for any species.
   4. Synthesis. We found pervasive empirical evidence for the overriding
   role of humans in the large-scale spread of invasive plants from
   multiple taxa. The observed spread patterns differ significantly from
   those portrayed in the literature, emphasizing the need to develop new
   frameworks to explore large-scale spread in general and invasive spread
   in particular. With public data sets of invasive species observations
   becoming increasingly more available, the time is ripe to go beyond
   exploration of species traits and habitat suitability and to examine the
   actual patterns and the mechanisms of large-scale invasive spread, even
   at a scale of thousands of kilometres over land.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{95-110}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Historical conceptual divisions in ecology are dissolving as
   ecologists seek general currencies for understanding plant function,
   population dynamics, species interactions and ecosystem processes.
   Foremost among such synthetic approaches are population-ecosystem models
   (PEMs), which treat the biomass dynamics of individuals as a foundation
   for coupled demographic and biogeochemical processes.
   2. Because plant productivity and tissue composition drive terrestrial
   energy and nutrient cycling, and plant growth itself is often used as a
   fitness proxy, PEMs predict that phenomena related to population
   dynamics, such as species coexistence, are associated with processes at
   the ecosystem level. I argue that this line of thought reflects a
   persistent misunderstanding of the relationship of plant growth-the
   creation of new structural biomass- and individual fitness.
   3. A survey of measured energetic costs of a wide variety of plant
   functions suggests that the majority of assimilated energy for many
   plants is allocated to survival rather than growth processes. This
   diversion of assimilate to survival-such as fighting infection, reducing
   potential tissue damage, or storing reserves in the face of defoliation
   risk-contributes to individual fitness but may not impact the flow of
   energy and nutrients in the environment or to other trophic levels.
   4. Synthesis. Using simple models of plant energy budgets, I demonstrate
   how incorporating survival allocation into PEMs using a bet-hedging
   approach can decouple population and ecosystem dynamics. In revisiting
   what little is known about how individual plants use energy, I suggest
   that recasting plant strategy theory in an energetic-demographic
   framework may offer a useful way forward in the drive to unify
   population and ecosystem processes.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal communities worldwide are faced with climate change effects that
   include sea level rise and increases in the severity and frequency of
   storms. We present a framework for coastal adaptation to these impacts
   in planning efforts, using the landscape of the Toms River-Barnegat Bay
   ecosystem in New Jersey (eastern coast of United States, 90 km south of
   New York City) as a case study. This plan is a proof-of-concept, showing
   that collaborative design can improve the ability of shore regions in
   many regions to recover from storms and sea level rise if it uses a
   broad concept of the shore's ecological and geomorphological structures.
   Ecological connections are maintained or restored from the sand beach
   through the tidal bay to the mainland Pine Barrens, allowing species to
   migrate inland as their ecosystems change over time. This plan also
   re-envisions shore tourism by attracting visitors to the larger and
   wider shore area, an approach that can maintain or even increase social
   and economic activity as sea level changes. Transportation routes
   connecting the changing shoreline area to inland sites help to integrate
   social activities throughout the region. Watershed based projects to
   handle stormwater runoff from severe inland storms are also required.
   These principles can be applied in any coastal landscape where sea level
   rise is expected. This approach was fostered and supported by a USHUD
   program - Rebuild by Design - to incorporate unique, collaborative,
   architectural and ecological approaches to changing climate and sea
   level rise in Hurricane Sandy-affected states. These ecological concepts
   can be adapted for use to maintain biotic and economic processes in

Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{Arid environments are characterized by resource pulses that cause
   spatio-temporal variability in species abundance, which can make
   population assessments difficult. Mobile acoustic methods may improve
   survey success by maximizing geographic extent, characterizing landscape
   distribution patterns, and improving encounter rates. Bats exemplify
   survey challenges in arid environments as they are highly mobile and
   aggregate around spatio-temporal resource hotspots. We compared bat
   detection success of stationary acoustic methods to that of mobile
   acoustic transects. In a semi-arid landscape, we recorded bat
   echolocation calls and compared three different sampling methods along
   the same 24 km route: a driven transect; a set of five, permanent
   ten-minute point counts; and a set of point counts at nightly randomized
   locations. The effect of method on the number of bat passes was analyzed

   number of passes for the mobile method was 2.14 (CI: 1.45-2.99) and 0.98

   driven transects more effectively measure bat activity in arid and open

Abstract = {{Among the environmental stresses experienced by bacteria, temperature
   shifts are one of the most important. In this study, we discovered a
   novel cold adaptation mechanism in Shewanella oneidensis that occurs at
   the DNA level and is regulated by cryptic prophage excision. Previous
   studies on bacterial cold tolerance mainly focus on the structural
   change of cell membrane and changes at the RNA and protein levels.
   Whether or not genomic change can also contribute to this process has
   not been explored. Here we employed a whole-genome deep-sequencing
   method to probe the changes at DNA level in a model psychrotrophic
   bacteria strain. We found that temperature downshift induced a 10
   000-fold increase of the excision of a novel P4-like cryptic prophage.
   Importantly, although prophage excision only occurred in a relatively
   small population of bacteria, it was able to facilitate biofilm
   formation and promote the survival of the entire population. This
   prophage excision affected cell physiology by disrupting a critical gene
   encoding transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA). In addition, we found that the
   histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) could silence prophage
   excision via binding to the promoter of the putative excisionase gene at
   warm temperatures. H-NS level was reduced at cold temperatures, leading
   to de-repression of prophage excision. Collectively, our results reveal
   that cryptic prophage excision acts as a regulatory switch to enable the
   survival of the host at low temperature by controlling the activity of
   tmRNA and biofilm formation.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Annual counts of migrating raptors at fixed observation points are a
   widespread practice, and changes in numbers counted over time, adjusted
   for survey effort, are commonly used as indices of trends in population
   size. Unmodeled year-to-year variation in detectability may introduce
   bias, reduce precision of trend estimates, and reduce power to detect
   trends. We conducted dependent double-observer surveys at the annual
   fall raptor migration count at Lucky Peak, Idaho, in 2009 and 2010 and
   applied Huggins closed-capture removal models and information-theoretic
   model selection to determine the relative importance of factors
   affecting detectability. The most parsimonious model included effects of
   observer team identity, distance, species, and day of the season. We
   then simulated 30 years of counts with heterogeneous individual
   detectability, a population decline (lambda = 0.964), and unexplained
   random variation in the number of available birds. Imperfect
   detectability did not bias trend estimation, and increased the time
   required to achieve 80\% power by less than 11\%. Results suggested that
   availability is a greater source of variance in annual counts than
   detectability; thus, efforts to account for availability would improve
   the monitoring value of migration counts. According to our models,
   long-term trends in observer efficiency or migratory flight distance may
   introduce substantial bias to trend estimates. Estimating detectability
   with a novel count protocol like our double-observer method is just one
   potential means of controlling such effects. The traditional approach of
   modeling the effects of covariates and adjusting the index may also be
   effective if ancillary data is collected consistently.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological shifts in shallow lakes from clear-water macrophyte-dominated
   to turbid-water phytoplankton-dominated are generally thought of as
   rapid short-term transitions. Diatom remains in sediment records from
   shallow lakes in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America provide new
   evidence that the long-term ecological stability of these lakes is
   defined by the legacy of large regime shifts. We examine the modern and
   historical stability of 11 shallow lakes. Currently, four of the lakes
   are in a clear-water state, three are consistently turbid-water, and
   four have been observed to change state from year to year
   (transitional). Lake sediment records spanning the past 150-200 yr
   suggest that (1) the diatom assemblage is characteristic of either clear
   or turbid lakes, (2) prior to significant landscape alteration, all of
   the lakes existed in a regime of a stable clear-water state, (3) lakes
   that are currently classified as turbid or transitional have experienced
   one strong regime shift over the past 150-200 yr and have since remained
   in a regime where turbid-water predominates, and (4) top-down impacts to
   the lake food-web from fish introductions appear to be the dominant
   driver of strong regime shifts and not increased nutrient availability.
   Based on our findings we demonstrate a method that could be used by lake
   managers to identify lakes that have an ecological history close to the
   clear-turbid regime threshold; such lakes might more easily be returned
   to a clear-water state through biomanipulation. The unfortunate reality
   is that many of these lakes are now part of a managed landscape and will
   likely require continued intervention.}},

   `developments,' and 11 `changing' sites where ongoing development
   converted forests to single-family residential neighborhoods. In the
   first few years of clearing, building, and occupation of new
   neighborhoods by humans avian communities shifted from those typical of
   second-growth forest to those more characteristic of developments.
   During this time avian diversity increased and numerical dominance by
   abundant birds declined. Species that adapted and exploited development
   reproduced more successfully there than did forest-dependent species
   that avoided development. Adults of species that thrived in developments
   attained equal annual survival across reserved to developed landscapes,
   while species that avoided neighborhoods tended to survive poorly
   outside of reserves. The humans living in our study areas frequently fed
   birds and provided nest boxes. These actions were positively correlated
   with increases in secondary cavity nesting and seed eating birds. Humans
   also maintained outdoor cats and 11 \% of humans both fed birds and let
   their cats outside. These actions were negatively correlated with the
   abundance of birds regularly using feeders. We suggest that a key
   management goal in urban ecosystems is the maintenance of avian
   diversity because a diverse avifauna engages a diversity of humans.}},

Abstract = {{In mountainous areas, cold air drainage from high to low elevations has
   pronounced effects on local temperature, which is a critical driver of
   many ecosystem processes, including carbon uptake and storage. Here, we
   leverage new approaches for interpreting ecosystem carbon flux
   observations in complex terrain to quantify the links between
   macro-climate condition, drainage flows, local microclimate, and
   ecosystem carbon cycling in a southern Appalachian valley. Data from
   multiple long-running climate stations and multiple eddy covariance flux
   towers are combined with simple models for ecosystem carbon fluxes. We
   show that cold air drainage into the valley suppresses local temperature
   by several degrees at night and for several hours before and after
   sunset, leading to reductions in growing season respiration on the order
   of similar to 8\%. As a result, we estimate that drainage flows increase
   growing season and annual net carbon uptake in the valley by >10\% and
   >15\%, respectively, via effects on microclimate that are not be
   adequately represented in regional- and global-scale terrestrial
   ecosystem models. Analyses driven by chamber-based estimates of soil and
   plant respiration reveal cold air drainage effects on ecosystem
   respiration are dominated by reductions to the respiration of
   aboveground biomass. We further show that cold air drainage proceeds
   more readily when cloud cover and humidity are low, resulting in the
   greatest enhancements to net carbon uptake in the valley under clear,
   cloud-free (i.e., drought-like) conditions. This is a counterintuitive
   result that is neither observed nor predicted outside of the valley,
   where nocturnal temperature and respiration increase during dry periods.
   This result should motivate efforts to explore how topographic flows may
   buffer eco-physiological processes from macroscale climate change.}},

Abstract = {{European Union (EU) Member States have agreed to limit their greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions from sectors not covered by the EU Emissions Trading
   Scheme, including emissions from agricultural sector. The aggregated GHG
   emission rate (i.e. t CO2 eq. from agricultural sector per country) is
   commonly used to measure the overall size of agriculture's influence on
   climate. And indeed, since 2005, EU has managed to decrease its
   aggregated GHG emissions by 3.1\%. However, the question is does that
   mean that EU's agriculture has become less emission intensive? This
   paper answers the question by providing a different perspective for the
   assessment and comparison of the agricultural GHG emissions in 28 EU
   Member States. It is done by applying three different approaches,
   including creation of derived indicators and application of
   multi-criteria analysis (TOPSIS), which is a novel approach for
   comparison of agricultural GHG emission mitigation performance. The
   results show that each EU Member State performs very differently in
   emission intensities. Even more, the emission intensity results show an
   alarming tendency of increase in most of the EU Member States, which
   indicates that the measured changes in aggregate agricultural GHG
   emission rates are misleading. Therefore, the paper suggests
   reconsidering the policy targets for GHG emission limits. (C) 2016

Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{368-376}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Biodiversity loss can be accelerated by human consumption in regions
   that are far removed from habitat degradation because of economic
   globalization, but no study has directly quantified the effects of
   global trade on extinction risks at a global scale with consideration
   for species differences. We propose a novel biodiversity footprint index
   based on bird extinction risks to evaluate the effects of global wood
   production and trade on biodiversity. Using 536 endangered bird species
   threatened by wood harvesting and logging, we calculated the
   ``quasi-extinction{''} probabilities, that is, the probabilities that
   population sizes become lower than an extinction threshold after habitat
   loss based on initial population sizes and forest habitat loss rates. We
   then used bilateral wood trade data to link the biodiversity impacts in
   wood exporters to wood importers. We found that if recent trends in
   forest cover loss continue until 2100, bird species in Brazil would be
   the most rapidly and heavily affected by wood production and trade,
   followed by those in Indonesia; these two countries alone would account
   for about half of all global bird extinctions. Large-scale wood
   importers (i.e., China, Japan, and the United States) significantly
   elevate overseas extinction risks and, simultaneously, reduce domestic
   impacts, indicating a heavy responsibility of these countries for global
   biodiversity loss. We also conducted a scenario analysis, which showed
   that the total projected number of extinct species would not decrease if
   each country produced the amount of wood materials necessary to meet
   current consumption levels. This is because bird extinction risks in
   tropical wood importers, such as Mexico and the Philippines, as well as
   Japan and China will increase if these countries increase domestic wood
   production. Our biodiversity footprint index is useful to identify
   countries whose bird species are highly affected by wood production and
   trade, and to quantify the role of wood trade in bird species
   extinctions. Additional scenario analyses are needed to establish
   effective patterns of wood production and consumption for bird
   biodiversity conservation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The urbanization of watersheds is a highly dynamic global phenomenon
   that must be monitored. With consequences for the environment, the
   population, and the economy, accurate products at adequate spatial and
   temporal resolutions are required and demanded by the science community
   and stakeholders alike. To address these needs, a new Impervious Surface
   Area (ISA) product was created for a Portuguese Watershed (Mondego
   river) from Landsat data (a combination of leaf-on multispectral bands,
   derived products, and NDVI time series), using Regression Tree Models
   (RTM). The product provides 30-m spatial resolution ISA estimates
   (0-100\%) with a Mean Average Error (MAE) of 1.6\% and Root Mean Square
   Error (RMSE) of 5.5\%.
   A strategy to update the baseline product was tested in earlier imagery
   (2001 and 2007) for a subset of the watershed. Instead of updating the
   baseline product, the strategy seeks to identify stable training samples
   and remove those where change was detected in a time series of Change
   Vector Analysis (CVA). The stable samples were then used to create new
   ISA models using RTM. The updated maps were similar to the original
   product in terms of accuracy metrics (MAE: 2001: 2.6\%; 2007:3.6\%).
   The products and methodology offer a new perspective on the urban
   development of the watershed, at a scale previously unavailable. It can
   also be replicated elsewhere at a low cost, leveraging the growing
   Landsat data archive, and provide timely information on relevant land
   cover metrics to the scientific community and stakeholders. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Historical reference conditions have long been used to guide the
   restoration of degraded ecosystems. However, a rapidly changing climate
   and altered disturbance regimes are calling into question the usefulness
   of this approach. As a consequence, restoration goals are increasingly
   focused on creating communities that are resilient to novel
   environmental stressors and emphasis is being placed on defining
   functional targets through the use of plant traits. While changes in
   forest structure and composition have received much attention, long-term
   changes in stand-level functional traits are not well understood. We
   used dendrochronology to reconstruct historical forest structure and
   composition in 1880, the year immediately following the disruption of
   the natural fire regime in a mixed conifer forest in Arizona, USA. We
   analysed the differences in pre-settlement and contemporary forest
   composition, structure and community-weighted mean (CWM) traits, and
   functional diversity metrics (Rao's Q and functional richness) for four
   plant functional traits: leaf nitrogen content (leaf N), specific leaf
   area (SLA), wood density and bark thickness. We observed significant
   shifts in forest composition, structure, CWM traits and functional
   diversity from 1880 to 2011. These changes reflect a reduction in fire
   and drought tolerance, driven largely by increases in the relative
   importance of Abies concolor and Pinus strobiformis. Compositional
   changes were associated with declines in CWM leaf N, SLA, wood density
   and bark thickness. We found lower multitrait functional diversity
   (Rao's Q) in contemporary forests driven primarily by leaf N; however,
   bark thickness variation was greater in contemporary forests than in
   1880.Synthesis and applications. Compositional shifts towards reduced
   average bark thickness and wood density in contemporary forests driven
   by land-use change have likely reduced forest resilience to both fire
   and drought. Managers can manipulate forest structure and species
   composition to achieve functional objectives by increasing stand-level
   bark thickness to promote fire tolerance and increasing stand-level wood
   density to promote drought tolerance. Forecasts for extended fire
   seasons along with declining precipitation are projected for many
   ecosystems around the planet. A focus on restoring optimal functional
   trait combinations may be as important as managing ecosystem structure
   for restoring resilient ecosystems.

Abstract = {{Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a commonly applied solution to coral
   reef degradation, yet coral reefs continue to decline worldwide. We
   argue that expanding the range of MPAs to include degraded reefs

   ecological criteria for MPA design, siting, and management. Rather than
   focusing solely on preserving healthy reefs, our approach focuses on the

   The new criteria would help identify sites with the highest potential
   for recovery and the greatest resistance to future threats (e.g.,
   increased temperature and acidification) and sites that contribute to
   MPA connectivity. The DR-MPA approach is a compliment rather than a
   substitute for traditional MPA design approaches. We believe that the
   DR-MPA approach can enhance the natural, or restoration-assisted,
   recovery of DRs and their ecosystem services; increase total reef area

Abstract = {{Distinguishing the relative influence of historic (i.e. natural) versus
   anthropogenic factors in metapopulation structure is an important but
   often overlooked step in management programs of threatened species.
   Biotas in freshwater wetlands and floodplains, such as those in the
   Murray-Darling Basin (MDB)-one of Australia's most impacted ecosystems,
   are particularly susceptible to anthropogenic fragmentation. Here we
   present a comprehensive multilocus assessment of genetic variation in
   the threatened southern pygmy perch Nannoperca australis (578
   individuals; 45 localities; microsatellite, allozyme and mitochondrial
   DNA datasets), an ecological specialist with low dispersal potential. We
   assess patterns of spatial structure and genetic diversity in
   populations spanning the highly fragmented MDB and test whether recent
   anthropogenic modification has disrupted range-wide connectivity. We
   detected strong and hierarchical population structure, very low genetic
   diversity and lack of contemporary gene flow across the MDB. In
   contrast, the apparent absence of pronounced or long-term
   phylogeographic structure suggests that observed population divergences
   generally do not reflect deeply historic natural fragmentation.
   Coalescent-based analyses supported this inference, revealing that
   divergence times between populations from the upper and lower MDB fall
   into the period of European settlement. It appears that the observed
   contemporary isolation of populations is partly explained by the severe
   modification of the MDB post-dating the onset of European settlement.
   Our integrated approach substantially improves the interpretation of how
   fragmentation impacts present-day biodiversity. It also provides novel
   contributions for risk-assessing management actions in the context of
   captive breeding and translocations of small freshwater fishes, a group
   of increasing global conservation concern.}},

Abstract = {{AimAllochronic speciation occurs when sympatric populations sharing
   similar feeding regimes diverge because they mate at different times.
   Such speciation mode is fascinating because it permits the study of
   subsequent adaptations and/or geographic range shifts undergone by the
   populations that face new ecological constraints. Moreover, exploring
   whether intraspecific differentiation is accompanied by niche divergence
   is crucial for planning efficient biodiversity management and invasive
   species control. Here, we address the topic of potential climatic niche
   divergence between two sympatric populations of the pine processionary
   moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (PPM) that diverged under allochrony. The
   larval development of a PPM population recently discovered in coastal
   regions of Portugal, referred to as the summer population (SP), occurs
   in the spring-summer instead of the autumn-winter as for all other
   populations of this species.
   LocationPortugal.
   MethodsWe carried out intensive field sampling in the area where both
   populations are sympatric and calibrated spread (MigClim approach) and
   species distribution models (ensemble forecasting approach) to depict
   the response of SP to environment and predict its potential range under
   current and future climatic conditions.
   ResultsSince its discovery in 1997, the distribution of SP has been
   expanding along the Western coasts of Portugal. Still, its establishment
   in inland regions failed, even though suitable hosts occur. Our models
   identify maximal temperatures as the main constraint explaining SP
   absence from inland regions. The coastal area where winter populations
   and SP co-occur displays unique climatic conditions (moderate maximal
   and minimal temperatures), which enable the coexistence of these
   populations with totally different phenologies. The models predict a
   future decrease of SP range due to climate warming.
   Main conclusionsWe show here that a climatic niche shift occurred
   following allochronic divergence. This study highlights how climate
   differentially affects allochronic populations and how considering
   intraspecific diversity is crucial when predicting species responses to
   climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate assessment of forest carbon storage and uptake is central to
   policymaking aimed at mitigating climate change and understanding the
   role forests play in the global carbon cycle. Disturbances have highly
   diverse impacts on forest carbon dynamics, making them a challenge to
   quantify and report. Time since disturbance is a key intermediate
   determinant that aids the assessment of disturbance-driven carbon
   emissions and removals legacies. We propose a new methodology of
   quantifying time since disturbance and carbon flux across forested
   landscapes in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) at a fine scale (30 m) by
   combining remote sensing (RS)-based disturbance year, disturbance type,
   and above-ground biomass with forest inventory data. When a recent
   disturbance is detected, time since disturbance can be directly
   determined by combining three RS-derived disturbance products, or time
   since the last stand clearing can be inferred from a RS-derived 30m
   biomass map and field inventory-derived species-specific biomass
   accumulation curves. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is further mapped
   based on carbon stock and flux trajectories derived from the
   Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model in our prior work that
   described how NEP changes with time following harvest, fire, or bark
   beetle disturbances of varying severity. Uncertainties from biomass map
   and forest inventory data were propagated by probabilistic sampling to
   provide a statistical distribution of stand age and NEP for each forest
   pixel. We mapped mean, standard deviation, and statistical distribution
   of stand age and NEP at 30m in the PNW region. Our map indicated a net
   ecosystem productivity of 5.9 Tg C yr(-1) for forestlands circa 2010 in
   the study area, with net uptake in relatively mature (>24 years old)
   forests (13.6 Tg C yr(-1)) overwhelming net negative NEP from tracts
   that had recent harvests (-6.4 TgC yr(-1)), fires (-0.5 TgC yr(-1)), and
   bark beetle outbreaks (-0.8 TgC yr(-1)). The approach will be applied to
   forestlands in other regions of the conterminous US to advance a more

Abstract = {{Background: A key innovation may allow one group of species to radiate
   and replace another, but the role of competition and background
   extinctions for the replacement process is vigorously debated and
   unclear.
   Questions: Is a minimum competitive advantage necessary to initiate
   replacement? Are background extinctions of the incumbent species
   necessary? What speciation and extinction dynamics characterize the
   replacement process and how do they differ from radiation into an empty
   niche space?
   Model features: We used a classic eco-evolutionary model describing
   asexual species competing for resources distributed along a single niche
   axis. Successive evolutionary branching generated an adaptively
   radiating community. Evolutionary innovation was introduced as an
   increased carrying capacity. Externally driven extinctions were also
   added.
   Mathematical methods: The model was studied using individual-based
   simulations. We monitored the radiation of the new group into the niche
   space of the original group and recorded the time to near-complete
   (90\%) and complete (100\%) replacement, along with rates of extinction
   and speciation of new and old groups.
   Results and conclusions: We demonstrate that replacement may occur by
   the radiation of a competitively superior group. Increasing the
   competitive advantage shortened replacement times, but there was no
   particular threshold advantage. Origination rates in new groups were
   comparable to extinction rates of the original groups, keeping the total
   number of species approximately constant - tentatively a result of niche
   widths and overall available niche space in the underlying model being
   unaffected by these innovations. Extra background extinctions speeded up
   the process, consistent with observed patterns in the fossil record that
   replacement is sped up during mass extinctions, but an increased
   extinction rate also introduced uncertainty and a higher risk of global
   extinction of the superior group.
   The replacement process was mainly driven by evolutionary competitive
   exclusion. The old, inferior type had an elevated rate of extinction
   matched by an increased speciation rate of the superior type. Incumbency
   also played a role, but we found little support for a strict incumbent
   replacement scenario, where replacement is driven entirely by background
   extinctions of the old group and opportunistic speciations of the new
   group.
   Compared with adaptive radiation into an empty niche space, replacement
   was slow and relict species from the original group could linger in
   marginal and previously unexploited niche space that provided a niche
   refuge and prevented complete replacement. Similar patterns are also
   found in the fossil record.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Populations are often subject to changes in their
   environments (either locally or due to movement of a population), which,
   if large enough, require them to adapt in order to persist. This is
   `evolutionary rescue'.
   Questions: What factors affect the ability of a population to recover
   after a sudden change in its environment? What can be measured about an
   initial population, prior to the environmental change, that can improve
   the predictability of evolutionary rescue?
   Methods: A deterministic model and simulations of an individual-based
   model (IBM).
   Results: Heritability that decreases with decreasing population size
   could prevent evolutionary rescue in the deterministic model. For the
   IBM, the probability of rescue decreased with increasing magnitude of
   the environmental change and with decreasing initial population size. At
   times, heritability of a trait can increase as selection occurs. Most
   extinctions occurred shortly after the change. Rescue depended
   significantly on the genetics of the population at the time of the
   environmental change, and predictive power about which populations go
   extinct, or persist, is improved by knowing the mean genotypic value and
   genetic variance in the initial population. However, there remains
   considerable uncertainty in such predictions.
   Conclusions: Persistence after a sudden environmental change was greater
   in populations with more individuals and more genetic variance at the
   time of the change, and depended on rapid adaptation soon after the
   change, without which extinction was likely. Understanding the amount
   and dynamics of genetic variation can improve predictability of
   persistence, but there is inescapable randomness in evolution and
   ecology that will always, we believe, preclude tight predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and reliable predictions of invasive species distributions are
   urgently needed by land managers for developing management plans and
   monitoring new potential areas of establishment. Presence-only species
   distribution models are commonly used in these evaluations, however they
   are rarely tested with independent data over time or compared with
   presence-absence models fit with the same presence data. Using Maxent,
   we developed a presence-only model of invasive cheatgrass (Bromus
   tectorum L) distribution in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA
   in 2007 fit with limited data, and then tested the model with
   independent presence and absence data collected between 2008 and 2013.
   This model was verified using threshold dependent and threshold
   independent evaluation metrics. Next we developed a Maxent model with
   cheatgrass presence data from 2007 through 2013 (i.e. Maxent 2013), and
   compared this model to a presence-absence method (i.e., generalized
   linear model; GLM 2013) using the same data. Threshold dependent and
   threshold independent evaluation metrics suggested Maxent 2013
   outperformed GLM 2013, and a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test
   indicated relative probability outputs were not significantly different
   between the models in geographic space. Based on known presences and
   absences of cheatgrass collected in the field, the Maxent 2013 and GLM
   2013 relative probability outputs were highly correlated at absence
   locations but less correlated at presence locations. A Kappa comparison
   of Maxent 2007 and Maxent 2013 binary output provides evidence that
   Maxent is robust when fit with limited data. Our results indicate Maxent
   is an appropriate model for use when land management objectives are
   supported by limited resources and thus require a conservative, but
   highly accurate estimate of habitat suitability for invasive species on
   the landscape. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is

Abstract = {{The metacommunity concept studies the processes that structure
   communities on local and regional scales. This concept is useful to
   assess spatial variability. However, temporal patterns (e.g., ecological
   succession and colonization) are neglected in metacommunity studies,
   since such patterns require temporally extensive, and hard to execute
   studies. We used experimental habitats in temporary streams located
   within the Brazilian Cerrado to evaluate the importance of succession
   for the aquatic insect metacommunity. Five artificial habitats
   consisting of wrapped crushed rock were set transversally to the water
   flow in five streams. The habitats were sampled weekly to assess
   community composition, and replaced after sampling to identify new
   potential colonizers. We analyzed the accumulation of new colonizers
   after each week using a logistic model. We selected pairs of
   experimental habitats and estimated the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index
   to assess the community composition trajectory during the experiment We
   used the dissimilarity values in ANOVA tests, identifying the importance
   of time and space for the community. The number of new taxa stabilized
   in the third week, and we estimated a weekly increase of 1.61 new taxa
   in the community after stabilization. The overall pattern was a small
   change on community composition, but one stream had a higher weekly
   turnover. Our results showed a relevant influence of time in the initial
   communities of aquatic insects of temporary streams. However, we must
   observe the temporal pattern in a spatial context, once different
   streams have different successional history regarding number of taxa and
   community turnover. We highlight the importance of aerial dispersal and
   movement to seek oviposition sites as an important factor in determining
   colonization patterns. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Volume = {{203}},
Pages = {{43-54}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Clearing forests for oil palm plantations is a major threat to tropical
   terrestrial biodiversity, and may potentially have large impacts on
   downstream marine ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs). However, little is
   known about the impacts of runoff from oil palm plantations, so it is
   not clear how oil palm development should be modified to minimize the
   risk of degrading marine ecosystems, or how marine conservation plans
   should be modified to account for the impacts of oil palm development.
   We coupled terrestrial and marine biophysical models to simulate changes
   in sediment/nutrient composition on reefs as a result of oil palm
   development in Papua New Guinea, and predicted the response of coral and
   seagrass ecosystems to different land-use scenarios. The condition of
   almost 60\% of coastal ecosystems were predicted to be substantially
   degraded (more than a 50\% decline from their initial state) after 5
   years if all suitable land was converted to oil palm, with only 4\% of
   coastal ecosystems improving in condition as trees matured. We evaluated
   marine ecosystem condition if the oil palm developments were consistent
   with global sustainability guidelines and found that there were only
   slight improvements in ecosystems condition compared to the scenario
   with complete conversion of forest to oil palm. Substantially reducing
   the impact of oil palm development on marine ecosystems required
   limiting new plantings to hill slopes below 15, a more stringent
   restriction than currently allowed for in the sustainability guidelines.
   We evaluated priority marine conservation areas given current land-use
   and found reef ecosystems in these areas will likely be heavily degraded
   in the future from runoff. We find that marine conservation plans should
   be modified to prioritize turbid areas where coral communities may be
   more tolerant of increased suspended sediment in the water. The approach
   developed here provides guidelines for modifying marine conservation
   priorities in areas with oil palm development. Importantly, oil palm
   development guidelines cannot be truly ecologically sustainable unless
   they are modified to account for the impacts of oil palm on coastal
   marine ecosystems. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately monitoring of tree phenological dynamics is crucial for
   understanding how forest ecosystems respond to various climate changes,
   and a variety of methods recently have been established for
   accomplishing this task. However, efficient techniques for featuring
   conifer phenology are still lacking. In fact, characterizing conifer
   phenological variations have long been an issue, because conifers tend
   to show hard-to-discern changes in terms of no matter color or crown
   morphology for different seasons. To address this conventional ``conifer
   issue{''}, this study attempted the state-of-the-art remote sensing
   technology of mobile terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR)
   (also termed as mobile terrestrial laser scanning, MLS) to reflect the
   seasonal-scale phenological variations of conifers, specifically in a
   case of Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris) growing under the Mediterranean
   climate in Perth, Australia. The MLS-collected data shows that for the
   conifers growing under different temperature and precipitation
   conditions, lasers, in a statistical sense, behave with different
   penetrations into their crowns. In light of this phenomenon, a new
   seasonal-scale conifer phenological indicator (CsPI) was proposed, i.e.
   the ratio between the average of the horizontal penetration distances
   for the entire laser points backscattered from a crown and its diameter
   calculated along with the horizontal direction of laser incidence. The
   performance of the newly-proposed CsPI was assessed by the means of
   meta-analysis, i.e. comparing the CsPI-indicated conifer response to
   seasonal climate changes in Perth with the derived rule of stem radial
   growth rates at different seasons in Mesic, Spain, both in the
   Mediterranean climate scenarios. The correlations with positive results
   showed that the proposed schematic plan of applying MLS and the
   developed phenological indicator both are validated, and this study has
   opened a new way for reflecting the seasonal-scale phenological
   variations of conifers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Comparing geographically referenced maps has become an important aspect
   of spatial ecology (e.g. assessing change in distribution over time).
   Whilst humans are adept at recognising and extracting structure from
   maps (i.e. identifying spatial patterns), quantifying these structures
   can be difficult. Here, we show how the Structural Similarity (SSIM)
   index, a spatial comparison method adapted from techniques developed in
   computer science to determine the quality of image compression, can be
   used to extract additional information from spatial ecological data. We
   enhance the SSIM index to incorporate uncertainty from the underlying
   spatial models, and provide a software algorithm to correct for internal
   edge effects so that loss of spatial information from the map comparison
   is limited. The SSIM index uses a spatially-local window to calculate
   statistics based on local mean, variance, and covariance between the
   maps being compared. A number of statistics can be calculated using the
   SSIM index, ranging from a single summary statistic to quantify
   similarities between two maps, to maps of similarities in mean,
   variance, and covariance that can provide additional insight into
   underlying biological processes. We demonstrate the applicability of the
   SSIM approach using a case study of sperm whales in the Mediterranean
   Sea and identify areas where local-scale differences in space-use
   between groups and singleton whales occur. We show how novel insights
   into spatial structure can be extracted, which could not be obtained by
   visual inspection or cell-by-cell subtraction. As an approach, SSIM is
   applicable to a broad range of spatial ecological data, providing a
   novel, implementable tool for map comparison. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Abstract = {{Impacts of human civilization on ecosystems threaten global
   biodiversity. In a changing environment, traditional in situ approaches
   to biodiversity monitoring have made significant steps forward to
   quantify and evaluate BD at many scales but still, these methods are
   limited to comparatively small areas. Earth observation (EO) techniques
   may provide a solution to overcome this shortcoming by measuring
   entities of interest at different spatial and temporal scales.
   This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the role of EO to
   detect, describe, explain, predict and assess biodiversity. Here, we
   focus on three main aspects related to biodiversity taxonomic diversity,
   functional diversity and structural diversity, which integrate different
   levels of organization molecular, genetic, individual, species,
   populations, communities, biomes, ecosystems and landscapes. In
   particular, we discuss the recording of taxonomic elements of
   biodiversity through the identification of animal and plant species. We
   highlight the importance of the spectral traits (ST) and spectral trait
   variations (STV) concept for EO-based biodiversity research. Furthermore
   we provide examples of spectral traits/spectral trait variations used in
   EO applications for quantifying taxonomic diversity, functional
   diversity and structural diversity. We discuss the use of EO to monitor
   biodiversity and habitat quality using different remote-sensing
   techniques. Finally, we suggest specifically important steps for a
   better integration of EO in biodiversity research.
   EO methods represent an affordable, repeatable and comparable method for
   measuring, describing, explaining and modelling taxonomic, functional
   and structural diversity. Upcoming sensor developments will provide
   opportunities to quantify spectral traits, currently not detectable with
   EO, and will surely help to describe biodiversity in more detail.
   Therefore, new concepts are needed to tightly integrate EO sensor
   networks with the identification of biodiversity. This will mean taking
   completely new directions in the future to link complex, large data,
   different approaches and models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Biomes are important constructs for organizing understanding of how the
   worlds' major terrestrial ecosystems differ from one another and for
   monitoring change in these ecosystems. Yet existing biome classification
   schemes have been criticized for being overly subjective and for
   explicitly or implicitly invoking climate. We propose a new biome map
   and classification scheme that uses information on (i) an index of
   vegetation productivity, (ii) whether the minimum of vegetation activity
   is in the driest or coldest part of the year, and (iii) vegetation
   height. Although biomes produced on the basis of this classification
   show a strong spatial coherence, they show little congruence with
   existing biome classification schemes. Our biome map provides an
   alternative classification scheme for comparing the biogeochemical rates
   of terrestrial ecosystems. We use this new biome classification scheme
   to analyse the patterns of biome change observed over recent decades.
   Overall, 13\% to 14\% of analysed pixels shifted in biome state over the
   30-year study period. A wide range of biome transitions were observed.
   For example, biomes with tall vegetation and minimum vegetation activity
   in the cold season shifted to higher productivity biome states. Biomes
   with short vegetation and low seasonality shifted to seasonally
   moisture-limited biome states. Our findings and method provide a new
   source of data for rigorously monitoring global vegetation change,

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We examined the dynamics of stand structure and composition over 60
   years in two natural secondary forest plots in central Hokkaido, Japan,
   that had been severely disturbed by a stand-replacing windthrow in 1954.
   We determined temporal trends in tree density, species richness, species
   diversity, successional composition, and stand developmental stage. One
   of the plots contained a coniferous stand prior to the disturbance; the
   second plot contained a mixed stand. Tree density and species richness
   increased after the windthrow, and peaked in both stands in 1991, 37
   years after the windthrow. Based on the dynamics of tree density and
   species richness, the stand development phase of both plots remained
   within the stand initiation stage until 1991, and then progressed to the
   stem exclusion stage by 2014, 60 years after the windthrow. Based on
   patterns of increasing tree density by species in both plots, vegetative
   regeneration was presumed to have contributed abundantly to the recovery
   of the stand after the windthrow. Species diversity increased after the
   windthrow as species richness increased in both stands; diversities
   peaked 23 or 32 years after the windthrow and declined slightly
   thereafter. Although the successional composition of the pre-disturbance
   coniferous stand regressed to an early stage under the influence of the
   windthrow, the relative importance of late-successional species
   approached the pre-disturbance value as the plot recovered. In contrast,
   the successional composition of the mixed conifer/hardwood plot was
   unaffected by the windthrow, but gradually changed to an early stage
   over several decades following the windthrow. The difference in
   successional composition between plots was likely a result of
   differences in pre-disturbance stand conditions between stands. Our
   60-year permanent plot study determined stand and population dynamics,
   the duration of the stand initiation stage, and the interrelationships
   between diversity and species richness. Long-term permanent plot studies
   contribute crucial data for the interpretation of forest dynamics

Abstract = {{Climate changes are expected to increase fire frequency, fire season
   length, and cumulative area burned in the western United States. We
   focus on the potential impact of mid-21st-century climate changes on
   annual burn probability, fire season length, and large fire
   characteristics including number and size for a study area in the
   Northern Rocky Mountains. Although large fires are rare they account for
   most of the area burned in western North America, burn under extreme
   weather conditions, and exhibit behaviors that preclude methods of
   direct control. Allocation of resources, development of management
   plans, and assessment of fire effects on ecosystems all require an
   understanding of when and where fires are likely to burn, particularly
   under altered climate regimes that may increase large fire occurrence.
   We used the large fire simulation model FSim to model ignition, growth,
   and containment of wildfires under two climate scenarios: contemporary
   (based on instrumental weather) and mid-century (based on an ensemble
   average of global climate models driven by the A1B SRES emissions
   scenario). Modeled changes in fire patterns include increased annual
   burn probability, particularly in areas of the study region with
   relatively short contemporary fire return intervals; increased
   individual fire size and annual area burned; and fewer years without
   large fires. High fire danger days, represented by threshold values of

   fire managers, ERC is an indicator of fire intensity potential and fire
   economics, with higher ERC thresholds often associated with larger, more
   expensive fires. Longer periods of elevated ERC may significantly
   increase the cost and complexity of fire management activities,
   requiring new strategies to maintain desired ecological conditions and
   limit fire risk. Increased fire activity (within the historical range of
   frequency and severity, and depending on the extent to which ecosystems
   are adapted) may maintain or restore ecosystem functionality; however,
   in areas that are highly departed from historical fire regimes or where
   there is disequilibrium between climate and vegetation, ecosystems may
   be rapidly and persistently altered by wildfires, especially those that

Abstract = {{Aquatic ecological models can effectively simulate material flows and
   structural changes in complex ecosystems, and are thus widely used for
   pollution control and ecosystem management of wetlands. The
   emergent-macrophyte-dominated wetland is an important wetland type, but
   the ecological model researches for this wetland type are relatively
   limited. The Hanshiqiao wetland, located in the riparian floodplain of
   the Chaobai River, is a typical emergent-macrophyte-dominated wetland.
   In this research, it was adopted as the study case to develop an aquatic
   ecological model. In this model, the emergent macrophyte (Phragmites
   australis) was specifically considered. Two key processes were taken
   into account: the uptake nutrients of this emergent macrophyte, and its
   artificial harvesting. The results showed that the simulation effects
   using the new aquatic ecological model considering emergent aquatic
   plants are more accurate than those from previous models. Furthermore,
   using the proposed method, the ecological effects of four ecological
   restoration measures were compared. Results showed that the effect of
   biomass enhancement on ecological restoration was not obvious in the
   wetland and that increasing the water supplement was a little more
   effective than improving the water quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Natural resource agencies are increasingly required to prioritise
   management of multiple non-native aquatic plants (macrophytes) in
   freshwater ecosystems. Characterising the consequences of invasions for
   ecological processes and corresponding ecosystem services is fundamental
   to this decision-making process, but requires an understanding of
   impacts across physical, chemical, and biological responses.
   Accordingly, we evaluated the multi-trophic impacts of the invasive
   macrophyte Myriophyllum aquaticum (Haloragaceae; parrotfeather) along
   the mainstem Chehalis River, Washington, U.S.A. Weexamined invertebrate,
   plant and fish community responses to varying degrees of parrotfeather
   abundance and simultaneously characterised variation in physical
   structure and dissolved oxygen (DO) across the dominant native and
   non-native plant species. DO concentrations were significantly reduced
   and approached hypoxic levels in areas dominated by parrotfeather
   compared with native vegetation. Increased structural complexity, volume
   and biomass of parrotfeather was associated with increased diversity of
   epiphytic invertebrates. However, these more diverse invertebrate
   assemblages were dominated by amphipods, whereas native macrophytes were
   characterised by cladocerans, chironomids and gastropods. Non-native
   fishes (primarily centrarchid species) were more strongly associated
   with sites where parrotfeather was present and diversity of non-native
   fishes was positively correlated along a gradient of parrotfeather
   abundance. Native fish associated with parrotfeather areas were those
   that tend to be tolerant of degraded or lower quality habitats. We saw
   little evidence of exclusion of other macrophytes; native and non-native
   plant diversity and abundance were positively correlated with the
   parrotfeather gradient. This may reflect that analysis was done at a
   site level, and competitive dominance might be apparent by changes in
   species richness at smaller (plot) scales or over longer periods.
   Alternatively, parrotfeather may demonstrate minimal effects on native
   plant composition. Given the effects observed across multiple habitat
   characteristics and biota, parrotfeather appears to be a highly
   impactful invader where it establishes. Many of the changes we observed
   appear to derive from the emergent leaves and dense mat formation of
   parrotfeather compared with a submersed structure more typical of the
   native community. Our results suggest that managers should specifically
   consider contrasting characteristics between non-native and native
   physical structure when assessing and prioritising threats of invasive
   macrophytes.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1662-1672}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Alternate stable states (ASS) theory is a dominant conceptual framework
   for understanding processes that support resilience of ecological
   communities in the face of multiple anthropogenic disturbances. For
   decades, coral reefs have been cited as a classic example of ASS, yet
   this position remains highly controversial, largely because convincing
   empirical evaluations have been elusive.
   Using a combination of empirical measurements of positive feedback
   processes and simulation modelling, we assessed ASS in coral reefs of
   the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) by identifying the potential for
   multiple basins of attraction from a mechanistic perspective.
   Using bioassays of algal growth and consumption, we quantified two
   spatially localized positive feedback mechanisms on coral reefs:
   increasing herbivore activity associated with higher coral abundances
   and amelioration of nutrient limitation leading to higher algal growth
   in areas with higher algal abundance.
   Analysis of a model of benthic community dynamics incorporating these
   feedbacks showed they were central to producing hysteresis and
   bistability in the model, two hallmarks of ASS. Further, reefs simulated
   with conditions matching those measured at Isla Contadora, Panama,
   displayed ASS dynamics while producing spatial patterns matching field
   observations. This provides model-derived support, based on empirically
   measured conditions of ETP reefs, for the presence of ASS.
   Synthesis. The combination of experimental bioassays to measure feedback
   strengths and simulation models to evaluate the influence of those
   feedbacks provides a novel, non-destructive approach to evaluating ASS
   dynamics that can be applied in threatened ecosystems where classic
   approaches are not viable.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 150 years dams have been constructed and water diverted
   from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers to provide water for the San
   Francisco Bay area, the Central Valley and Southern California. Together
   with land reclamation and sedimentation from hydraulic mining practices
   during the gold rush, this has led to major changes in the delta
   environment. In 1994 the Federal and State Governments established the
   CALFED program, which had as its objectives: (1) to attempt to ensure
   the reliability of water supplies; (2) to improve the water quality of
   the Delta; (3) to attempt to restore the Delta ecosystem; and (4) to
   improve levee protection. More recently CALFED has been superseded by
   the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Reform Act to manage all activities in
   the Delta in support of the ``two co-equal goals'' of water supply
   reliability and ecosystem restoration, with the Bay-Delta Conservation
   Plan (BDCP) drafted with the intent to guide both the operation of water
   infrastructure and the ecosystem restoration activities. The act also
   created a new administrative agency, the Delta Stewardship Council with
   the mandate to develop a comprehensive management plan for the Delta,

Abstract = {{Arid rangelands have been severely degraded over the past century.
   Multi-temporal remote sensing techniques are ideally suited to detect
   significant changes in ecosystem state; however, considerable
   uncertainty exists regarding the effects of changing image resolution on
   their ability to detect ecologically meaningful change from satellite
   time-series.
   (1) Assess the effects of image resolution in detecting landscape
   spatial heterogeneity. (2) Compare and evaluate the efficacy of coarse
   (MODIS) and moderate (Landsat) resolution satellite time-series for
   detecting ecosystem change.
   Using long-term (similar to 12 year) vegetation monitoring data from
   grassland and shrubland sites in southern New Mexico, USA, we evaluated
   the effects of changing image support using MODIS (250-m) and Landsat
   (30-m) time-series in modeling and detecting significant changes in
   vegetation using time-series decomposition techniques.
   Within our study ecosystem, landscape-scale (> 20-m) spatial
   heterogeneity was low, resulting in a similar ability to detect
   vegetation changes across both satellite sensors and levels of spatial
   image support. While both Landsat and MODIS imagery were effective in
   modeling temporal dynamics in vegetation structure and composition,
   MODIS was more strongly correlated to biomass due to its cleaner (i.e.,
   fewer artifacts/data gaps) 16-day temporal signal.
   The optimization of spatial/temporal scale is critical in ensuring
   adequate detection of change. While the results presented in this study
   are likely specific to arid shrub-grassland ecosystems, the approach
   presented here is generally applicable. Future analysis is needed in
   other ecosystems to assess how scaling relationships will change under
   different vegetation communities that range in their degree of landscape
   heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{We present a case study illustrating a multidisciplinary approach for
   characterizing, mapping and monitoring the bio-ecological properties of
   Mediterranean mountain grasslands in extensive grazing systems. The
   approach was developed to provide the basis for the management plan of a
   cluster of Natura 2000 special conservation areas in the Central
   Apennine mountains, Italy (with a total area of 79,500 ha, including
   22,130 ha of grasslands). It includes a novel methodology for estimating
   sustainable stocking rates of different plant communities, at a detailed
   spatial scale over large areas, based on the integration of: (i) a
   classification of grassland types, based on physical habitat
   stratification and vegetation sampling; (ii) a forage-value assessment
   of each grassland type, obtained from field sampling of botanical
   composition and corrected with remote-sensing information on pasture
   microtopography; (iii) an estimate of primary productivity at a detailed
   spatial scale, obtained from the remote-sensed Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) calibrated with biomass field data.
   Additionally, to obtain a bioclimatic characterization of the grasslands
   and to determine the optimal grazing season for each grassland type,
   intra-annual phenological signatures were obtained from the Enhanced
   Vegetation Index (EVI). Given the inherent limitations in the
   sustainable stocking rates concept, and the particular susceptibility of
   dry grasslands to changes in grazing regimes, we tested two biological
   indicators, the Auchenorrhyncha quality index (AQI) and the
   Arthropod-based biological soil quality index (QBS-ar). These indicators
   take into account above- and below-ground arthropod diversity,
   respectively, and are applied here for the first time to the specific
   purpose of monitoring grazing load effects on ecological quality and
   biodiversity of Natura 2000 dry grasslands. We conclude that: (i) it is
   possible to effectively integrate biomass estimates, obtained from
   publicly available satellite data, with a relatively simple field
   sampling of botanical composition, to achieve a detailed spatialization
   of sustainable stocking rates; (ii) within the same Natura 2000 habitat
   type there can be a large spatial heterogeneity in both sustainable
   stocking rates and optimal stocking season: thus, grazing should be kept
   under careful human control to maintain the habitats in the desired
   conservation status; (iii) while plant species richness was not
   correlated to grazing intensity, both AQI and QBS-ar had a significant
   negative correlation to grazing levels and can thus be useful for
   monitoring the actual ``sustainability{''} of livestock loads on
   different aspects of grassland ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Ongoing climate change is known to cause an increase in the frequency

   regions of the Earth. While gradual changes in the climatological
   conditions have already been shown to strongly influence plant flowering
   dates, the question arises if and how extremes specifically impact the

   calls for the application of statistical methods that are tailored to
   the specific properties of event time series. Here, we employ event
   coincidence analysis, a novel statistical tool that allows assessing
   whether or not two types of events exhibit similar sequences of
   occurrences in order to systematically quantify simultaneities between
   meteorological extremes and the timing of the flowering of four shrub
   species across Germany. Our study confirms previous findings of
   experimental studies by highlighting the impact of early spring
   temperatures on the flowering of the investigated plants. However,
   previous studies solely based on correlation analysis do not allow
   deriving explicit estimates of the strength of such interdependencies
   without further assumptions, a gap that is closed by our analysis. In
   addition to direct impacts of extremely warm and cold spring
   temperatures, our analysis reveals statistically significant indications

Abstract = {{The seasonal availability of water within a tree's rooting zone may be
   an important determinant for individual tree growth and overall forest
   health, particularly in riparian corridors of Mediterranean climate
   zones that are vulnerable to water stress. Here, we present a new method
   that combines dendro-isotopes and isotope modelling for determining how
   water source use varies over 10 consecutive growing seasons (2000-2010)
   for co-occurring species Populus nigra and Fraxinus excelsior, along the
   Rhone River, south-eastern France. We conducted highly resolved delta
   O-18 analysis of cellulose micro-slices within tree-rings and
   back-calculated the delta O-18 signature of source water available at
   the time of growth using a biochemical fractionation model. We related
   these patterns to inferred seasonal hydrological partitioning through
   comparison with delta O-18 of waters from the vadose and phreatic zones,
   precipitation and streamflow. The shallowly rooted Fraxinus displayed
   greater sub-annual source water variability, as well as greater isotopic
   enrichment, reflecting use of precipitation-derived vadose moisture. Its
   earlywood was formed mainly from winter rainfall (delta O-18 depleted)
   whilst the latewood was composed from growing season precipitation
   (delta O-18 enriched). In Populus, the sub-annual source water use was
   relatively depleted, suggesting use of hyporheic water and regional
   groundwater. From 2007, both species converged in their pattern of water
   source uptake which was attributed to a decline in phreatic water access
   for Populus. These results demonstrate that the seasonal variability in
   source water use can be identified retrospectively, a method which may
   prove important for anticipating the future consequences of
   climate-driven changes to the hydrological cycle. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{1. The importance of monitoring biodiversity to detect and understand
   changes throughout time and to inform management is increasingly
   recognized. Monitoring schemes should be globally unified, spatially
   integrated across scales, long term, and cost-efficient.
   2. We propose a framework to design optimized multispecies-targeted
   monitoring networks over large areas. The method builds upon previous
   developments on systematic conservation planning in terms of optimizing
   resource allocation in space, and comprises seven steps: (a) determine
   which questions will be addressed, (b) define species to be monitored,
   (c) compile occurrence data for all defined species, (d) predict the
   overall distribution of each species, (e) collect relevant environmental
   data and identify homogeneous strata, (t) set targets for the minimum
   number of monitoring sites per species and/or stratum and (g) identify
   optimal monitoring sites.
   3. We tested whether the monitoring networks designed with our framework
   have increased performance when compared to networks obtained with
   simple-random or stratified-random sampling by using a set of different
   indicators. To that end, we designed monitoring networks using optimized
   and non-optimized sampling schemes, applied to a case study in Portugal,
   where the goal was to design a monitoring network for amphibians and
   reptiles, to complement the one currently established in Spain.
   4. Results allowed us to conclude that monitoring networks designed with
   our method tend to outperform the non-optimized ones, in terms of higher
   species diversity (i.e. higher number of species and equity across
   monitoring sites), higher representation of environmental strata, and
   particularly higher coverage of rare species, with less survey effort.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We developed a framework to allocate
   monitoring sites for multiple species at broad scales using predictive
   models and optimization algorithms currently applied in systematic
   conservation planning. This framework presents field survey
   cost-efficiency advantages when compared to other standard sampling

Abstract = {{1. Management intervention in ecosystems with degraded environmental
   services requires innovative resource management strategies that go
   beyond conventional restoration and conservation practices. We
   established a unique study that experimentally targeted extreme fire
   conditions during drought in humid subtropical and semi-arid ecoregions.
   2. In the southern Great Plains of North America, conventional
   restoration and conservation practices have been either historically
   ineffective or economically cost-prohibitive at restoring
   grass-dominated ecosystems following conversion to resprouting
   shrublands. Our aim was to assess the potential for extreme fire during
   drought to force the system along an alternate ecological trajectory
   from its current progression towards closed-canopy resprouting shrub
   land, something that conventional fire prescriptions have been unable to
   accomplish.
   3. We first tested the potential for high-intensity fires exhibiting
   extreme behaviour to disrupt the progression from grassland to
   shrubland. In both ecoregions, significant levels of mortality were
   observed for mature woody resprouters. As a result, densities were
   either maintained or reduced 3 years following extreme fire treatments,
   whereas resprouter densities continued to increase in areas that were
   not burned.
   4. A second interventionist approach involving extreme fire and
   herbicide treatment combinations was not supported. Interactions between
   prescribed extreme fire and herbicide did not significantly reduce
   resprouter densities more than using herbicide alone at either site.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Extreme fires during drought resulted in
   exceptionally high levels of mortality across all sizes of woody
   resprouters and limited recruitment, resulting in 35-55\% lower
   densities of resprouters than in areas not burned. These findings
   counter prevailing scientific and management expectations, which are
   based largely on studies that impose tight controls over prescribed fire
   conditions and avoid extreme fire behaviour. Future interventions for
   controlling woody resprouters with fire may require rethinking the
   present ideology that extreme fire behaviour has no place in modern
   social ecological landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{1 High-throughput genomic methods are increasingly used to investigate
   invertebrate thermal responses with greater dimensionality and
   resolution than previously achieved. However, corresponding methods for
   characterizing invertebrate phenotypes are still lacking. To scale up
   the characterization of invertebrate thermal responses, we propose a
   novel use of thermocyclers as temperature-controlled incubators.
   2 Here, we tested the performance of thermocyclers as incubators and
   demonstrated the application of this method to efficiently characterize
   the thermal responses of model and non-model invertebrates.
   3 We found the thermocyclers performed with high precision, accuracy and
   resolution under various and fluctuating ambient conditions. We were
   able to successfully characterize the temperature-dependent development
   of grasshopper eggs (Warramaba virgo), as well as the effects of
   fluctuating temperature cycles on the survival of mosquito eggs (Aedes
   aegypti) and developmental success of Drosophila simulans larvae, all
   with similar survival rates to conventional methods.
   4 Thermocyclers are a general and transferrable means to scale up
   current methods of incubating small invertebrates. They permit rapid
   characterization of high-dimensional physiological responses to natural
   thermal regimes. When combined with existing approaches in thermal and
   evolutionary biology, these methods will advance our understanding of,
   and ability to predict, biological adaptations and responses to
   environmental changes.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. Ecologists and many evolutionary biologists relate the variation in
   physiological, behavioural, life-history, demographic, population and
   community traits to the variation in weather, a key environmental
   driver. However, identifying which weather variables (e.g. rain,
   temperature, El Nino index), over which time period (e.g. recent
   weather, spring or year-round weather) and in what ways (e.g. mean,
   threshold of temperature) they affect biological responses is by no
   means trivial, particularly when traits are expressed at different times
   among individuals.
   2. A literature review shows that a systematic approach for identifying
   weather signals is lacking and that the majority of studies select
   weather variables from a small number of competing hypotheses that are
   founded on unverified a priori assumptions. This is worrying because
   studies that investigate the nature of weather signals in detail suggest
   that signals can be complex. Using suboptimal or wrongly identified
   weather signals may lead to unreliable projections and management
   decisions.
   3. We propose a four-step approach that allows for more rigorous
   identification and quantification of weather signals (or any other
   predictor variable for which data are available at high temporal
   resolution), easily implementable with our new R package `climwin'. We
   compare our approach with conventional approaches and provide worked
   examples.
   4. Although our more exploratory approach also has some drawbacks, such
   as the risk of overfitting and bias that our simulations show can occur
   at low sample and effect sizes, these issues can be addressed with the
   right knowledge and tools.
   5. By developing both the methods to fit critical weather windows to a
   wide range of biological responses and the tools to validate them and
   determine sample size requirements, our approach facilitates the
   exploration and quantification of the biological effects of weather in a
   rigorous, replicable and comparable way, while also providing a
   benchmark performance to compare other approaches to.}},

   for forest restoration}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The restoration of historical fire regimes is often a primary objective
   in the conservation of fire-adapted forests. However, individual
   species' responses to future climate change may uncouple historical
   vegetation-disturbance relationships, producing potentially negative
   ecological consequences to fire restoration. We used a landscape
   simulation model to assess how forest pattern will respond to-future
   climate regimes and whether the restoration of historical fire regimes
   will benefit forest conservation under future climate regimes. Our study
   landscape was the 335,000-ha Kaibab Plateau at the North Rim of the
   Grand Canyon spanning a broad elevation-vegetation gradient of
   pinyon-juniper, ponderosa pine, mixed conifer, and spruce-fir forests
   along with a range of associated fire regimes. We employed a novel
   multimodel landscape simulation approach using the Climate-Forest
   Vegetation Simulator to estimate individual tree species climate
   responses and LANDIS-II to simulate spatial patterns of fire
   disturbance, forest growth, regeneration, succession, and dispersal.
   Model simulations included three climate scenarios (no change, moderate
   change, and high change) and two fire scenarios (fire exclusion and fire
   restoration). The climate change scenarios produced declines in mean
   forest aboveground biomass (AGB) and a compositional turnover equal to
   one or two vegetation zones, approximating the vegetation displacement
   that occurred in this location during the Holocene. Fire restoration
   resulted in earlier, but roughly equivalent, AGB declines and
   compositional change. Uphill species migration in some elevation zones
   produced tree species-fire regime mismatches that promoted state changes
   and increased nonforest area. Regardless of fire management approach,
   our simulations project that the Kaibab Plateau will eventually be
   dominated by pinyon-juniper, oak, and ponderosa pine forest types, with
   a complete loss of mesic conifer species. Our results indicate that fire
   managers will have to be flexible with the application of historical
   fire regimes to avoid regeneration failures and abrupt declines in
   biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Human activities around parks can alter vegetation patterns within them,
   resulting in edge effects that degrade their ability to sustain
   ecological processes and support biodiversity. We quantified vegetation
   patterns and edge effects over a large geographic extent in Murchison
   Falls Conservation Area, Uganda, using freely available remotely sensed
   data. Over a 13-yr period, we quantified seasonal patterns in
   productivity using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),
   comparing the park exterior, a boundary zone <= 10 km from the border
   inside the park, and the park interior. To identify the extent of edge
   effects, we further fit mixed models by vegetation type within 1-km
   bands within the boundary zone. Productivity was higher in the park
   interior than exterior in both wet and dry seasons, and in the wet
   season, it was also lower in the boundary zone than the interior. NDVI
   variability differed between seasons; it declined from exterior to
   interior in the wet season, but was highest in the boundary zone and
   similar between interior and exterior during the dry season. Within the
   boundary zone, edge effects varied by land cover type and extended 4-6
   km into MFCA. Abrupt differences in vegetation patterns between the park
   and adjacent unprotected areas indicated a ``hard edge{''} in this
   system. While hard edges are readily apparent, the subtle changes in
   productivity that extend into and degrade park systems are harder to
   detect. We demonstrated a low-cost and novel approach to detect such
   effects using readily available satellite imagery, which indicated human
   influence affecting 29-40\% of the park. As human populations grow,
   parks will become further isolated, and measuring and managing edge
   effects may be crucial to achieving conservation objectives.}},

Abstract = {{There is intense interest in basic and applied ecology about the effect
   of global change on current and future species distributions.
   Projections based on widely used static modeling methods implicitly
   assume that species are in equilibrium with the environment and that
   detection during surveys is perfect. We used multiseason correlated
   detection occupancy models, which avoid these assumptions, to relate
   climate data to distributional shifts of Louisiana Waterthrush in the
   North American Breeding Bird Survey ( BBS) data. We summarized these
   shifts with indices of range size and position and compared them to the
   same indices obtained using more basic modeling approaches. Detection
   rates during point counts in BBS surveys were low, and models that
   ignored imperfect detection severely underestimated the proportion of
   area occupied and slightly overestimated mean latitude. Static models
   indicated Louisiana Waterthrush distribution was most closely associated
   with moderate temperatures, while dynamic occupancy models indicated
   that initial occupancy was associated with diurnal temperature ranges
   and colonization of sites was associated with moderate precipitation.
   Overall, the proportion of area occupied and mean latitude changed
   little during the 1997-2013 study period. Near-term forecasts of species
   distribution generated by dynamic models were more similar to
   subsequently observed distributions than forecasts from static models.
   Occupancy models incorporating a finite mixture model on detection - a
   new extension to correlated detection occupancy models - were better
   supported and may reduce bias associated with detection heterogeneity.
   We argue that replacing phenomenological static models with more
   mechanistic dynamic models can improve projections of future species
   distributions. In turn, better projections can improve biodiversity
   forecasts, management decisions, and understanding of global change
   biology.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is influencing bird phenology worldwide, but we still

   and productivity at a constant effort mist-netting station in western
   Pennsylvania using a model comparison approach. Several lines of
   evidence point to the sensitivity of 21 breeding passerines to climate
   change over five decades. The trends for temperature and precipitation
   over 53 years were slightly positive due to intraseasonal variation,
   with the greatest temperature increases and precipitation declines in
   early spring. Regardless of broodedness, migration distance, or breeding
   season, 13 species hatched young earlier over time with most advancing >
   3 days per decade. Warm springs were associated with earlier captures of
   juveniles for 14 species, ranging from 1- to 3-day advancement for every
   1 degrees C increase. This timing was less likely to be influenced by
   spring precipitation; nevertheless, higher rainfall was usually
   associated with later appearance of juveniles and breeding condition in
   females. Temperature and precipitation were positively related to
   productivity for seven and eleven species, respectively, with negative
   relations evident for six and eight species. We found that birds fledged
   young earlier with increasing spring temperatures, potentially
   benefiting some multibrooded species. Indeed, some extended the duration
   of breeding in these warm years. Yet, a few species fledged fewer
   juveniles in warmer and wetter seasons, indicating that expected future
   increases could be detrimental to locally breeding populations. Although
   there were no clear relationships between life history traits and
   breeding phenology, species-specific responses to climate found in our
   study provide novel insights into phenological flexibility in songbirds.

Abstract = {{1. Ecological thresholds represent abrupt species responses to minor
   changes in the environment. However, as aquatic organisms are frequently
   exposed to multiple stressors, prediction of taxon occurrence is
   challenging and often associated with much uncertainty. In this study,
   we analysed the response of stream benthic invertebrates to selected
   environmental gradients and determined the frequency and predictability
   of threshold responses.
   2. Re-analysis of taxon-specific change point values for 213 riverine
   benthic invertebrate taxa and nine water quality variables showed that
   the predictive performance was acceptable for 30.4\% and excellent for
   9.6\% of the total number of validated change points (n = 978). In
   total, 48.3\% of the taxa that were predicted to occur (taxon presence
   predicted) and 67\% of the taxa predicted not to occur (taxon absence
   predicted) were correct but with high variability across taxa and
   chemical variables. Predictive performance was the highest for
   stenoecious taxa and for certain chemical variables, such as ammonium
   nitrogen and the daytime dissolved oxygen concentration.
   3. Responses to peak level concentrations of water quality variables
   were less threshold-like compared with relationships with mean values.
   However, model predictions were equal for both of the approaches.
   4. Successful prediction of taxon absence at stress levels beyond the
   change point values showed that the latter can well represent the upper
   limit of the taxon-specific range of occurrence. Thus, change points are
   valuable for establishing and evaluating new water management tools,
   such as water quality criteria. By contrast, prediction of taxon
   presence at low levels of stress was associated with relatively high
   uncertainty, reflecting the limitation of taxon occurrence by stressors

   LocationPacific Islands.
   MethodsWe obtained DNA sequence data from one mitochondrial and three
   nuclear markers for 117 individuals, representing seven of the nine
   species within the ECSG. These data were analysed for concordance with
   the stepping-stone model using estimation of population structure,
   divergence dates, and historical biogeographical range. To assess
   hypotheses of independent lineages within each widespread species, we
   also employed the Bayesian Phylogenetics \& Phylogeography (BPP) program
   to define operational taxonomic units in {*}BEAST.
   ResultsPopulation structure analyses consistently found individuals from
   western island groups representing divergent populations, with central
   and eastern populations demonstrating minimal genetic variation.
   Phylogenetic hypotheses support a western origin for E. cyanura and E.
   impar, while biogeographical and divergence time estimations predict a
   recent and rapid expansion out of the western Pacific. The BPP and
   {*}BEAST analyses found evidence for five independent lineages within E.
   impar and five independent lineages within E. cyanura/E. pseudocyanura.
   Main conclusionsIn contrast to the expectations of a stepping-stone
   model, E. cyanura and E. impar each exhibit the genetic signature of a
   rapid radiation during the mid to late Pleistocene, with evidence for
   newly identified lineages, mainly on western islands. Of these recovered
   lineages, we propose three to be elevated to species status. These

   tackle them. We do so with the aim of contributing new insights to
   theory through answering the following research questions: What
   strategies to tackle wicked environmental problems are prominent in the
   literature?: To what extent do they provide pathways for tackling the
   defining characteristics of wicked environmental problems?; and, How are
   these strategies reflected in examples of practice? Our examples look at
   how emergent strategies have percolated, explicitly or implicitly, in
   the management of four problems in Scotland: (1) Securing sustainability
   and resilience of landscape and land-use systems through spatial
   planning; (2) Addressing population health through livestock disease
   control; (3) Mitigating climate change through woodland planting; and,
   (4) Mitigating rural diffuse pollution in freshwater systems. We present
   a consolidated set of characteristics of wicked problems against which
   we map strategies to tackle wicked problems proposed by a body of
   literature identified through a literature review and analysed using a
   thematic, qualitative approach. We identify fifteen strategies and show
   that most of these are, within the Scottish context, evident in
   practice. The extent to which the actual discourse has influenced praxis
   and how effective it has been is more difficult to determine but we
   conclude that, within a context of `incorrigible' problems, small steps
   have been made towards taming an untameable beast. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In Ait Kaci Azzou et al. (2015) we introduced an Importance Sampling
   (IS) approach for estimating the demographic history of a sample of DNA
   sequences, the skywis plot. More precisely, we proposed a new
   nonparametric estimate of a population size that changes over time. We
   showed on simulated data that the skywis plot can work well in typical
   situations where the effective population size does not undergo very
   steep changes. In this paper, we introduce an iterative procedure which
   extends the previous method and gives good estimates under such rapid
   variations. In the iterative calibrated skywis plot we approximate the
   effective population size by a piecewise constant function, whose values
   are re-estimated at each step. These piecewise constant functions are
   used to generate the waiting times of non homogeneous Poisson processes
   related to a coalescent process with mutation under a variable
   population size model. Moreover, the present IS procedure is based on a
   modified version of the Stephens and Donnelly (2000) proposal
   distribution. Finally, we apply the iterative calibrated skywis plot
   method to a simulated data set from a rapidly expanding exponential
   model, and we show that the method based on this new IS strategy
   correctly reconstructs the demographic history. (C) 2016 Published by

Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Increased availability of high-resolution movement data has led to the
   development of numerous methods for studying changes in animal movement
   behavior. Path segmentation methods provide basics for detecting
   movement changes and the behavioral mechanisms driving them. However,
   available path segmentation methods differ vastly with respect to
   underlying statistical assumptions and output produced. Consequently, it
   is currently difficult for researchers new to path segmentation to gain
   an overview of the different methods, and choose one that is appropriate
   for their data and research questions.
   Here, we provide an overview of different methods for segmenting
   movement paths according to potential changes in underlying behavior. To
   structure our overview, we outline three broad types of research
   questions that are commonly addressed through path segmentation: 1) the
   quantitative description of movement patterns, 2) the detection of
   significant change-points, and 3) the identification of underlying
   processes or `hidden states'. We discuss advantages and limitations of
   different approaches for addressing these research questions using
   path-level movement data, and present general guidelines for choosing
   methods based on data characteristics and questions. Our overview
   illustrates the large diversity of available path segmentation
   approaches, highlights the need for studies that compare the utility of
   different methods, and identifies opportunities for future developments

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},

Volume = {{201}},
Pages = {{69-77}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Return-on-investment (ROI) can help integrate prioritization efforts for
   developers and conservation organizations alike. To examine this
   complementarity and to investigate improving dialogue across these two
   sectors, we conducted paired ROI assessments from the perspective of
   wind development and biodiversity conservation in the northeastern
   United States. Spatially explicit layers defined the three ROI
   components: benefit, cost, and probability of success. For the wind
   development ROI, we modeled turbine suitability using the random forest
   algorithm to develop the benefit surface. We treated biodiversity
   information related to permitting and development as a cost surface and
   applied land conservation status towards the probability of success
   term. The conservation ROI applied biodiversity priorities as the
   benefit surface, applied a higher environmental cost to areas with high
   wind turbine development value, and used estimates of ecosystem
   resilience to define the probability of success. This ROI highlighted
   conservation potential after applying the constraints of wind energy
   development. The analysis suggests that New York State, US, may be able
   to accommodate 16,000 Megawatts of power generation while avoiding
   conservation priorities, more than sufficient landscape to situate
   turbines up to the predicted capacity based on grid reliability (6600
   MW). Further, the two ROI models taken together are more instructive
   than results from either model alone. Sensitivity analyses revealed that
   altering the weightings of the biodiversity input variables rarely
   changed the relationship among the two ROI models from place to place.
   We suggest that applying ROI from different perspectives may help form
   an important communication bridge between conservation and development
   tradeoffs, and prove valuable in the debate over renewable energy
   production options in the context of their environmental impacts. (C)

Abstract = {{With increasing human pressures on wildlife comes a responsibility to
   monitor them effectively, particularly in an environment of declining
   research funds. Scarce funding resources compromise the level and
   efficacy of monitoring possible to detect trends in abundance,
   highlighting the priority for developing cost-effective programs. A
   systematic and rigorous sampling regime was developed to estimate
   abundance of a small, genetically isolated spinner dolphin (Stenella
   longirostris) population exposed to high levels of human activities.
   Five monitoring scenarios to detect trends in abundance were evaluated
   by varying sampling effort, precision, power, and sampling interval.
   Scenario 1 consisted of monthly surveys, each of 12 days, used to obtain
   the initial two consecutive annual abundance estimates. Scenarios 2, 3,
   and 4 consisted of a reduced effort, while Scenario 5 doubled the effort
   of Scenario 1. Scenarios with the greatest effort (1 and 5) produced the
   most precise abundance estimates (CV = 0.09). Using a CV = 0.09 and
   power of 80\%, it would take 9 years to detect a 5\% annual change in
   abundance compared with 12 years at a power of 95\%. Under this
   best-case monitoring scenario, if the trend was a decline, the
   population would have decreased by 37\% and 46\%, respectively, prior to
   detection of a significant decline: With the potential of a large
   decline in a small population prior to detection, the lower power level
   should be used to trigger a management intervention. The approach
   presented here is applicable across taxa for which individuals can be
   identified, including terrestrial and aquatic mammals, birds, and

Title = {{Using Daphnia physiology to drive food web dynamics: A theoretical
   revisit of Lotka-Volterra models}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{29-42}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The Lotka-Volterra model is the most commonly used framework to describe
   the dynamics of ecological systems in which two species interact, one as
   a predator and the other as prey. Theoretical ecologists have since
   built on variants of these equations, frequently applying them to model
   the dynamics of algal-herbivore interactions in aquatic systems. In this
   study, we augment a Lotka-Volterra system by introducing a
   bioenergetically-explicit, ecophysiological model to examine how
   variations in resource allocation affect zooplankton growth and
   subsequently phytoplankton dynamics. Ingested material within a
   zooplankter's gut is separated into distinct internal congener pools
   that are used to support physiological processes occurring in a
   hierarchical direction: neurological functions, energetics,
   osmoregulatory maintenance, waste management, and finally growth.
   Consistent with the predictions of the ``stoichiometric knife edge{''}
   theory, our analysis suggests that a balanced algal congener composition
   is required to optimize zooplankton internal congener saturations,
   resulting in a maximal allocation of energy to growth. In examining the
   advantages rendered by different strategies of minimum and optimum
   somatic quotas when experiencing phosphorus-enrichment conditions, we
   show that herbivores with narrow homeostatic bounds and animals with low
   minimum quotas (or depletion specialists) achieve optimal performance
   first. Our analysis also predicts patterns of multiple stable equilibria
   in which the same environmental conditions can be characterized by
   dramatically different prey-to-predator ratios. Importantly, abrupt
   shifts from one state to another can be induced not only by short-term
   variations in food abundance but also by variations in the nutritional
   quality of the prey. Our predictions have profound implications for
   connecting microscopic processes with macroscopic patterns and offer new
   insights into the multitude of factors that modulate food web dynamics.

Abstract = {{The theory of securitization the so-called Copenhagen school centers the
   concept of security on various identified threats. Security based on the
   collective identity by which a society preserves its essential
   characteristics has been defined as community security, or societal
   security. The underlying principle of the Copenhagen school is that
   state-based, sovereignty-oriented security is ineffective unless the
   other components of security threats are addressed. The concept of human
   security, developed nearly simultaneously to that of securitization,
   identifies threat components at the sub-state level which are not
   traditionally understood as security concerns. Both schools of security
   thought are similar as they offer nontraditional approaches to
   understanding the concept of security. In this article, I explore
   securitization theory and the concept of human security to elaborate
   community perspectives in the understanding of security. In a case
   study, I investigate the security concerns of the indigenous peoples of
   the Arctic. The transformation of the Arctic by climate change and its
   impacts has resulted in new challenges and opportunities, so I explore
   how indigenous peoples in general and the Sami in particular understand
   security which promotes their societal security. Although I show that
   this group of people deserves recognition and the ability to exercise
   greater authority, I conclude that diverse concepts of security do not
   by any means undermine the core traditional concept of security. These
   aspects of security remain subject to scrutiny by states and exist in a
   vertical structure. The Sami, therefore, rely on affirmative actions by
   states to enjoy greater rights to maintain their community security. (C)

Abstract = {{Analogous to the spread of non-native species, shifts in native species'
   ranges resulting from climate and land use change are also creating new
   combinations of species in many ecosystems. These native range shifts
   may be facilitated by similar mechanisms that provide advantages for
   non-native species and may also have comparable impacts on the
   ecosystems they invade. Soil biota, in particular bacteria and fungi,
   are important regulators of plant community composition and below-ground
   ecosystem function. Compared to non-native plant invasions, there have
   been relatively few studies examining how soil biota influence - or are
   influenced by - native species range shifts. Here, we examined how a
   native range-expanding sagebrush species (Artemisia rothrockii) affects
   below-ground abiotic conditions and microbial community structure and
   function using next-generation sequencing coupled with other biotic and
   abiotic soil analyses. We utilized a range-expansion gradient, together
   with a shrub removal experiment and structural equationmodels, to
   determine the direct and indirect drivers of these interconnected
   processes. Sagebrush colonization increased bacterial and archaeal
   richness and diversity and altered community composition across the
   expansion gradient. Soil organic C and N and soil moisture increased
   with sagebrush presence; however, results varied across the expansion
   gradient. We found no relationship between sagebrush and soil pH;
   however, pH strongly influenced microbial richness and diversity.
   Microbial (substrate-induced) respiration was influenced by soil organic
   N, as well as microbial diversity and functional group relative
   abundances, highlighting direct and indirect effects of sagebrush on
   microbial community structure and function. Microbial community
   composition of soils after 4years of sagebrush removal was more similar
   to communities in shrub interspaces than underneath shrubs, suggesting
   microbial community resilience.Synthesis. Our results suggest that
   native range expansions can have important impacts on soil biological
   communities, soil chemistry and hydrology which can further impact
   below-ground ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and litter
   decomposition. The combination of high-throughput sequencing and
   structural equationmodelling used here offers an exciting yet
   underutilized approach to understanding how both native and non-native
   species' range expansions may affect the structure and function of soil

Abstract = {{Physical removal (e.g., harvest via traps or nets) of mature individuals
   may be a cost-effective or socially acceptable alternative to chemical
   control strategies for invasive species, but requires knowledge of the
   spatial distribution of a population over time. We used acoustic
   telemetry to determine the current and possible future role of traps to
   control and assess invasive sea lampreys, Petromyzon marinus, in the St.
   Marys River, the connecting channel between Lake Superior and Lake
   Huron. Exploitation rates (i.e., fractions of an adult sea lamprey
   population removed by traps) at two upstream locations were compared
   among three years and two points of entry to the system. Telemetry
   receivers throughout the drainage allowed trap performance (exploitation
   rate) to be partitioned into two components: proportion of migrating sea
   lampreys that visited trap sites (availability) and proportion of
   available sea lampreys that were caught by traps (local trap
   efficiency). Estimated exploitation rates were well below those needed
   to provide population control in the absence of lampricides and were
   limited by availability and local trap efficiency. Local trap efficiency
   estimates for acoustic-tagged sea lampreys were lower than analogous
   estimates regularly obtained using traditional mark-recapture methods,
   suggesting that abundance had been previously underestimated. Results
   suggested major changes would be required to substantially increase
   catch, including improvements to existing traps, installation of new
   traps, or other modifications to attract and retain more sea lampreys.
   This case study also shows how bias associated with telemetry tags can
   be estimated and incorporated in models to improve inferences about

Abstract = {{Harmful blooms of cyanobacteria (CyanoHABs) have increased globally and
   cyanotoxins associated with some CyanoHAB species pose serious health
   risks for animals and humans. CyanoHABs are sensitive to supply rates of
   both nitrogen and phosphorus, but sensitivity may vary among species
   (e.g., between diazotrophic and non-diazotrophic species) and a range of
   physiographic and environmental factors. A sustainable approach to
   manage CyanoHABs is therefore to limit the supply of nitrogen and
   phosphorus from catchments to receiving waters. Alternative approaches
   of within-lake treatment have increased risks and large capital and
   operational expenditure. The need to manage catchment nutrient loads
   will intensify with climate change, due to expected increases in
   nutrient remineralization rates, alteration in hydrological regimes, and
   increases in lake water temperature and density stratification. Many
   CyanoHAB species have physiological features that enable them to benefit
   from the effects of climate change, including positive buoyancy or
   buoyancy control, high replication rates at elevated water temperature,
   and nutrient uptake strategies adapted for the intermittency of nutrient
   supply with greater hydrological variability expected in the future.
   Greater attention needs to be focused on nonpoint sources of nutrients,
   including source control, particularly maintaining nitrogen and
   phosphorus in agricultural soils at or below agronomic optimum levels,
   and enhancing natural attenuation processes in water and solute
   transport pathways. Efforts to achieve effective catchment management
   and avert the dire ecological, human health and economic consequences of
   CyanoHABs must be intensified in an era of anthropogenically driven
   environmental change arising from increasing human population, climate

Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{122-131}},

Abstract = {{Forest ecosystems play a critical role in protecting water resources;
   yet the neoclassical stated preference assumption is that
   willingness-to-pay (WTP) for forest conservation is solely a function of
   the ecosystem services provided by these lands. Thus, little attention
   has been paid to the importance of policy processes as potentially
   influential drivers of WTP. Using a statewide web-based survey in
   Florida US and a relatively novel valuation approach (i.e., Best-Worst
   Choice), we examine public preferences for clean water benefits (e.g.,
   recreation, drinking water resources) as well as common conservation
   policy processes, such as land acquisition and financial assistance for
   landowners. We found forest/water protection programs provide an annual
   average of \$154-230 million in clean water benefits, and a significant
   portion of that value was associated with the policy process. Attitudes
   and beliefs about whom forests should be managed for, and who should
   manage forests, were also found to influence WTP behaviors. We conclude
   that including policy process information in the valuation survey allows
   respondents to better determine changes in utility among realistic

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Droughts affect many sectors, such as agriculture, economic, social,
   human health, and ecosystems. Many drought indices have been developed;
   yet, none of them quantifies the impacts of drought on stream health.
   The purpose of this study is to define a new drought index capable of
   assessing fish vulnerability. To accomplish this, a hydrological model,
   called the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and the Regional-scale
   Habitat Suitability model were integrated in order to understand the
   state of drought within 13,831 stream segments within the Saginaw Bay
   Watershed. The ReliefF algorithm was used as the variable selection
   method, and partial least squared regression was used to develop two
   sets of predictor models capable of determining current and future
   drought severities. Forty-seven different climate scenarios were used to
   investigate drought model predictability of future climate scenarios.
   The results indicated that the best drought model has a high capability
   for predicting future drought conditions with R-2 values ranging from
   0.86 to 0.89. In general, the majority of reaches (94\%) will experience
   higher drought probability under future climate scenarios compared to
   current conditions. The procedure introduced in this study is
   transferable to other watersheds with regional standards for
   environmental flow to measure the impacts of drought on stream health.

Abstract = {{Often, we think of cities as designed landscapes, where people manage
   everything from water to weeds. But we do not fully understand what
   happens to these extensively managed landscapes when there is an abrupt
   disruption in economic activity. Considering the ability of cities to
   support plant biodiversity and their importance as human habitat, we
   studied pre- and post-recession landscapes across a gradient of human
   influence by asking: How did vegetation change over time from before the
   housing bubble to after the nadir of the Great Recession? And how did
   vegetation vary across sites at regional versus residential scales? This
   investigation used long-term vegetation data to examine diversity trends
   and responses to a novel economic disturbance in, an urban
   social-ecological system. Overall, we found that plant species diversity
   increased through time across scales, while species composition
   homogenized in urban and agricultural areas. Residential yards, however,
   initially had high compositional heterogeneity which then increased over
   time. Changes in residential diversity were driven by substantial
   increases in the role of annual plants. This research improves our
   understanding of spatiotemporal vegetation dynamics in a coupled
   human-natural system, and specifically how urban vegetation dynamics are
   linked to anthropogenic influence. Ultimately, we recommend that city
   planners and managers consider economic trends when approaching
   community projects because of the interconnectedness of ecology and
   socioeconomics in urban landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Mangroves are unique in structure and functionally special, but
   ecologically sensitive to environmental changes. Hence, it is imperative
   to assess their structural and functional characteristics. Bearing this
   in mind, the present study analysed densities of trees, saplings,
   seedlings and sesarmid crab holes, as well as tree height, basal area,
   species diversity in function of the mangrove forest age groups (1-17.5
   year old), and in relation to soil conditions for four different
   seasons. The regenerative potential in terms of density of young plants
   (seedlings+saplings) varied significantly between seasons or forest age.
   A similar trend was observed with density of crab holes. However,
   complex index (a sum of species diversity, tree density total basal
   area, total tree height) varied significantly between forest ages or
   seasons. The density of young plants ranged from 1,647 per hectare in
   summer to 3,058 in post-monsoon; and the density was as high as 2 fold
   in post-monsoon, 38\% in pre-monsoon and 18\% in monsoon than that in
   summer. The number of sesarmid crab holes varied from 1,347 per hectare
   in monsoon to 4,782 in pre-monsoon, and the number of holes was found
   higher in pre- and post-monsoons and lower in extreme seasons (monsoon
   and summer), similar to density of young plants. There was a significant
   positive correlation between the density of young plants and number of
   crab holes or tree density sapling density or complex index. This work
   identified a new method of assessing the eco-functions of mangrove
   forest in a simple way by counting density of young plants and sesarmid

Pages = {{21-30}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We propose alternative fish-populations spatial indicators for use in
   the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Following Commission
   Decision 2010/477, we have applied two different spatial indicators to
   three fish populations with ``slow type{''} life-history traits, i.e.
   slow growing like Helicolenus daclylopterus, or large bodied like
   Merluccius merluccius and Lophius budegassa. We tested their efficiency
   separately and combined. One of these indicators, the presence/absence
   of the population in sampling squares, had already been applied during
   the initial assessment of the MSFD in Spain. Another indicator, the
   geographical spread, is proposed here as a new monitoring tool for the
   MSFD in Spanish waters. `` The results demonstrate for the three
   populations analyzed that neither indicator was sufficient alone to
   describe the population spatial pattern or its evolution. Thus, the
   approach to implementing the MSFD indicated in Commission Decision
   2010/477 is not sufficient to provide integrated information about the
   spatial behavior of the fish populations analyzed. Although numerical
   targets or threshold values cannot be set, directional targets could be
   proposed, based on the results of both indicators, if evaluation of them
   is extended to more species and more geographical areas. The analysis
   could be extended to other ``slow type{''} populations within the fish
   community and also to different ecoregions. We propose an approach
   including the estimation of two different indicators to monitoring both
   the area occupied and the geographical spread of fish populations within
   communities, interpreting them together to generate a more complete
   picture of the spatial patterns of those populations. In spite of the
   difficulties in fixing numerical targets or thresholds, or in
   distinguishing between environmentally and human driven changes in the
   population spatial distributions, this approach helps to summarize fish
   spatial behavior. It improves information from the indicators applied
   alone and reduces the requirement for a large number of maps (except for
   some particular event or population). The proposed indicators can be
   readily used by managers and politicians. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{39-48}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Freshwater stream systems are under immense pressure from various
   anthropogenic impacts, including climate change. Stream systems are
   increasingly being altered by changes to the magnitude, timing,
   frequency, and duration of their thermal regimes, which will have
   profound impacts on the life-history dynamics of resident biota within
   their home range. Although temperature regimes have a significant
   influence on the biology of instream fauna, large spatio-temporal
   temperature datasets are often reduced to a single metric at discrete
   locations and used to describe the thermal regime of a system;
   potentially leading to a significant loss of information crucial to
   stream management. Models are often used to extrapolate these metrics to
   unsampled locations, but it is unclear whether predicting actual daily
   temperatures or an aggregated metric of the temperature regime best
   describes the complexity of the thermal regime. We fit spatial
   statistical stream-network models (SSNMs), random forest and non-spatial
   linear models to stream temperature data from the Upper Condamine River
   in QLD, Australia and used them to semi-continuously predict metrics
   describing the magnitude, duration, and frequency of the thermal regime
   through space and time. We compared both daily and aggregated
   temperature metrics and found that SSNMs always had more predictive
   ability than the random forest models, but both models outperformed the
   non-spatial linear model. For metrics describing thermal magnitude and
   duration, aggregated predictions were most accurate, while metrics
   describing the frequency of heating events were better represented by
   metrics based on daily predictions generated using a SSNM. A more
   comprehensive representation of the spatio-temporal thermal regime
   allows researchers to explore new spatio-temporally explicit questions
   about the thermal regime. It also provides the information needed to
   generate a suite of ecologically meaningful metrics capturing multiple
   aspects of the thermal regime, which will increase our scientific
   understanding of how organisms respond to thermal cues and provide
   much-needed information for more effective management actions. (C) 2016

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{358-366}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Seagrasses worldwide are highly vulnerable to, and at increasing risk
   from reduced light availability, and robust light thresholds are
   required for evaluating future impacts of changing light conditions. We
   tested the morphological response (shoot density and growth) of four
   Indo-West Pacific seagrass species (Cymodocea serrulata, Halodule
   uninervis, Halophila ovalis and Zostera muelleri) to six daily light
   levels ranging from 0 to 23 mol m(-2) d(-1) (0-70\% surface irradiance)
   in cool (-23 degrees C) and warm temperatures (-28 degrees C) over 14
   weeks. The impact of light limitation on shoot densities and growth
   rates was higher at warm than at cool temperatures, and for 1 muelleri
   and H. ovalis than for C. serrulata and H. uninervis, in terms of both
   the time taken for the low light treatment to take effect and the
   predicted time to shoot loss (e.g. 17-143 days at 0 mol m(-2) d(-1)).
   Using fitted curves we estimated temperature-dependent thresholds (with
   estimates of uncertainty) for 50\% and 80\% protection of growth and
   shoot density, defined here as ``potential light thresholds{''} in
   recognition that they were derived under experimental conditions.
   Potential light thresholds that maintained 50\% and 80\% of seagrass
   shoot density fell within the ranges 1.1-5.7 mol m(-2) d(-1) and
   3.8-10.4 mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively, depending on temperature and
   species. Light thresholds calculated in separate in situ studies for two
   of the same species produced comparable results. We propose that the
   upper (rounded) values of 6 mol m(-2) d(-1) and 10 mol m(-2) d(-1) can
   be used as potential light thresholds for protecting 50\% and 80\% of
   shoot density for these four species over 14 weeks. As management
   guidelines should always be more conservative than thresholds for
   biological declines, we used error estimates to provide a quantitative
   method for converting potential light thresholds into guidelines that
   satisfy this criterion. The present study demonstrates a new approach to
   deriving potential light thresholds for acute impacts, describes how
   they can be applied in management guidelines and quantifies the
   timescales of seagrass decline in response to light limitation. This
   method can be used to further quantify cumulative impacts on potential
   light thresholds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   approach to circuit connectivity analysis}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{807-820}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Landscape connectivity analysis is a major tool in supporting
   biodiversity conservation. Several methodologies have been developed to
   tackle it by following two main paths. The first path exploits graph
   approaches and models focal nodes' connections on a
   resistance/conductance matrix depending on focal species' movement
   potential. The second path considers geometrical pattern analyses based
   on the calculation of structural landscape metrics. These approaches
   separately investigate functional and structural features of the
   landscape, and may come short of a total definition if used separately.
   Here we propose a new scalable, modular, participative and open-source
   procedure based on Fuzzy logic to combine the functional and structural
   aspects of connectivity. We applied this method on the highly fragmented
   landscape of the Po Plain, focusing on its rare and endangered plain
   springs named fontanili. We identified an expert panel and involved it
   in the assignation of permeability values of land use classes with
   respect to the capacity of movement of animal species typical of
   fontanili. We concurrently performed a quantitative evaluation of the
   landscape fragmentation with a moving window. We found that the
   functional and structural evaluations were poorly correlated in the area
   under study (Pearson's r= -0.35, p <0.001), We thus integrated these two
   non-overlapping analyses of the landscape by Fuzzy logic using
   thresholds and combination weights obtained from questionnaires proposed
   to the expert panel. The resulting index, termed Fuzzy Functionality
   Index (FFI), improved the level of information associated with landscape
   classification. By merging functional and structural aspects of the
   landscape, the FFI allowed us to discriminate different functional
   values of equally permeable parcels and vice versa. We demonstrate that
   FFI may act as a conductance measure in a circuit theory approach,
   highlighting ecological corridors between focal points of species'
   distribution. We present FFI as an effective predictive index to inspect
   complex and non-linear landscape dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Aim To examine species and trait composition in stream diatoms along
   environmental, climatic and spatial gradients and to ascertain if the
   use of different levels of biological organization is beneficial for
   investigating global environmental changes and the role of history in
   structuring communities.
   Location Global cover with datasets from the Antilles, France, Finland,
   New Zealand, La Reunion and the United States.
   Methods We related diatom species composition, guild composition, total
   richness and richness across guilds to environmental, climatic and
   spatial variables. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)
   with environmental variable fitting, redundancy analysis (RDA) with
   variation partitioning, analysis of similarities and linear mixed models
   as statistical tools.
   Results Species composition differed significantly among the study
   regions, while the differences in guild composition were less
   pronounced. US and French streams shared a large number of species,
   whereas islands shared only a few species with continents. For species
   composition, all predictors showed significant relationships with
   diatoms but pH, longitude, annual temperature and precipitation had the
   strongest impact. Variation partitioning revealed that the local
   environment outperformed climatic and spatial variables. For guild
   composition, there was a substantial overlap across regions in NMDS. The
   results from RDA demonstrated, however, that guild composition was
   better explained than species composition, especially by environmental
   variables. Both species and guild richness were significantly correlated
   with most predictors. Notably, species richness scaled positively with
   latitude.
   Main conclusions Diatom species and guild composition varied
   substantially in response to local environment and climatic and spatial
   variables indicating both environmental and historical effects. Species
   composition discriminated the geographical regions better, while guild
   composition detected the environmental gradients better. This emphasizes
   the need to examine different levels of organization to gain a deeper
   understanding of the roles of environment versus history in structuring
   communities. These findings suggest that diatom species distributions
   are under strong microevolutionary constraints. Conversely, guild
   distributions are less dependent on historic factors and are driven
   primarily by the environment, which makes them better suited for
   research on global environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Forecasting ecological responses to climate change is a common
   objective, but there are few methods for evaluating confidence in such
   predictions. For migratory species, in particular, it is also essential
   to consider the extent of spatial synchrony among separate breeding
   populations in range-wide predictions. We develop a quantitative method
   to evaluate the accuracy of climate-based ecological predictions and use
   this approach to assess the extent of spatio-temporal synchrony among
   distinct regions within the breeding range of a single migratory
   population.
   Location We model weekly site-specific summer abundances (1996-2011) of
   monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in the Midwestern USA as a
   function of climate conditions experienced during a shared spring
   migration/ breeding phase in Texas and separate summer recruitment
   periods in Ohio and Illinois.
   Methods Using negative binomial regression models, we evaluate
   spatio-temporal synchrony between monarchs in the two states and develop
   a novel quantitative assessment approach to determine the temporal
   predictive strength of our model with Bayesian P-values.
   Results Monarchs breeding in the Midwest exhibit spatio-temporal
   synchrony in Ohio and Illinois; cooler spring temperatures, average to
   above average precipitation in Texas and cooler than average summer
   temperatures are associated with higher population abundances in both
   states. At least 10 years of data are needed for adequate model
   predictability of average future counts. Because annual spring weather
   conditions in Texas primarily drive yearly abundances, as opposed to
   localized summer effects, year-specific counts are often difficult to
   predict reliably, specifically when predictive spring conditions are
   outside the range of typical regional conditions.
   Main conclusions Our assessment method can be used in similar analyses
   to more confidently interpret ecological responses to climate change.
   Our results demonstrate the relative importance of climatic drivers in
   predicting abundances of a migratory species and the difficulties in
   producing reliable predictions of animal populations in the face of
   climate change.}},

   data for benchmarking five range (dynamic) models of varying complexity
   including classical SDMs, SDMs coupled with simple dispersal or more
   complex population dynamic models (SDM hybrids), and a hierarchical
   Bayesian process-based dynamic range model (DRM). We specifically test
   the effects of demographic and community processes on model predictive
   performance. Under current climate, DRMs performed best, although only
   marginally. Under climate change, predictive performance varied
   considerably, with no clear winners. Yet, all range dynamic models
   improved predictions under climate change substantially compared to
   purely correlative SDMs, and the population dynamic models also
   predicted reasonable extinction risks for most scenarios. When
   benchmarking data were simulated with more complex demographic and
   community processes, simple SDM hybrids including only dispersal often
   proved most reliable. Finally, we found that structural decisions during
   model building can have great impact on model accuracy, but prior system
   knowledge on important processes can reduce these uncertainties
   considerably. Our results reassure the clear merit in using dynamic
   approaches for modelling species' response to climate change but also
   emphasize several needs for further model and data improvement. We
   propose and discuss perspectives for improving range projections through
   combination of multiple models and for making these approaches
   operational for large numbers of species.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is widely recognized that climate change will require a
   major spatial reorganization of forests, our ability to predict exactly
   how and where forest characteristics and distributions will change has
   been rather limited. Current efforts to predict future distribution of
   forested ecosystems as a function of climate include species
   distribution models (for fine-scale predictions) and potential
   vegetation climate envelope models (for coarse-grained, large-scale
   predictions). Here, we develop and apply an intermediate approach
   wherein we use stand-level tolerances of environmental stressors to
   understand forest distributions and vulnerabilities to anticipated
   climate change. In contrast to other existing models, this approach can
   be applied at a continental scale while maintaining a direct link to
   ecologically relevant, climate-related stressors. We first demonstrate
   that shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerances of forest stands are
   strongly correlated with climate and edaphic conditions in the
   conterminous United States. This discovery allows the development of a
   tolerance distribution model (TDM), a novel quantitative tool to assess
   landscape level impacts of climate change. We then focus on evaluating
   the implications of the drought TDM. Using an ensemble of 17 climate
   change models to drive this TDM, we estimate that 18\% of US ecosystems
   are vulnerable to drought-related stress over the coming century.
   Vulnerable areas include mostly the Midwest United States and Northeast
   United States, as well as high-elevation areas of the Rocky Mountains.
   We also infer stress incurred by shifting climate should create an
   opening for the establishment of forest types not currently seen in the
   conterminous United States.}},

Abstract = {{As biodiversity hotspots are often characterized by high human
   population densities, implementation of conservation management
   practices that focus only on the protection and enlargement of pristine
   habitats is potentially unrealistic. An alternative approach to curb
   species extinction risk involves improving connectivity among existing
   habitat patches. However, evaluation of spatially explicit management
   strategies is challenging, as predictive models must account for the
   process of dispersal, which is difficult in terms of both empirical data
   collection and modelling. Here, we use a novel, individual-based
   modelling platform that couples demographic and mechanistic dispersal
   models to evaluate the effectiveness of realistic management scenarios
   tailored to conserve forest birds in a highly fragmented biodiversity
   hotspot. Scenario performance is evaluated based on the spatial
   population dynamics of a well-studied forest bird species. The largest
   population increase was predicted to occur under scenarios increasing
   habitat area. However, the effectiveness was sensitive to spatial
   planning. Compared to adding one large patch to the habitat network,
   adding several small patches yielded mixed benefits: although overall
   population sizes increased, specific newly created patches acted as
   dispersal sinks, which compromised population persistence in some
   existing patches. Increasing matrix connectivity by the creation of
   stepping stones is likely to result in enhanced dispersal success and
   occupancy of smaller patches.Synthesis and applications. We show that
   the effectiveness of spatial management is strongly driven by patterns
   of individual dispersal across landscapes. For species conservation
   planning, we advocate the use of models that incorporate adequate
   realism in demography and, particularly, in dispersal behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns about loss of biodiversity and structural complexity in managed
   forests have recently increased and led to the development of new
   management strategies focused on restoring or maintaining ecosystem
   functions while also providing wood outputs. Variable retention harvest
   (VRH) systems, in which mature overstorey trees are retained in various
   spatial arrangements across harvested areas, represent one potential
   approach to this problem. However, long-term evaluations of the
   effectiveness of this strategy at sustaining plant community composition
   are needed as this strategy is increasingly applied in managed forest
   landscapes throughout the world. The forest ground layer plays a central
   role in forest ecosystem functioning, and we evaluated the long-term
   (11+ year) dynamics in ground-layer plant communities in response to VRH
   study in Pinus resinosa Aiton. forests. This large-scale, manipulative
   study included four overstorey (control, small gap-aggregated, large
   gap-aggregated and dispersed) and two understorey (ambient and reduced
   shrubs) treatments replicated four times in 16-ha stands. Changes in
   ground-layer community composition were apparent 11years following
   harvest, regardless of live-tree retention pattern. Richness and
   diversity increased and were driven by introduction and colonization of
   ruderal species, while forest interior species continued to persist
   across treatments. All life-forms responded positively to harvest with
   the exception of moss and clubmoss species. The lack of effect of
   spatial pattern of retention on ground-layer plant communities was
   likely related to the presence of a dense and persistent shrub layer, a
   result of decades of fire suppression. In particular, the greatest
   responses to overstorey retention pattern occurred in areas receiving
   shrub reduction treatments, indicating this recalcitrant layer likely
   filtered response to retention pattern.Synthesis and applications.
   Overall, this work highlights flexibility in choosing a variable
   retention harvest approach when sustaining ground-layer plant community
   diversity and composition are goals, but altered disturbance regimes
   (e.g. fire suppression, timber harvesting) that have facilitated the
   presence or formation of recalcitrant understories, need to be
   considered. The legacy effects of historical land use and alterations to
   natural disturbance regimes on the understorey in northern temperate
   forests are of equal, if not greater, importance to overstorey retention
   patterns in eliciting desired responses to variable retention harvest
   and need to be more carefully considered in future applications of this
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling the spread of invasive species, pests, and pathogens is
   often logistically limited to interventions that target specific
   locations at specific periods. However, in complex, highly connected
   systems, such as marine environments connected by ocean currents,
   populations spread dynamically in both space and time via transient
   connectivity links. This results in nondeterministic future
   distributions of species in which local populations emerge dynamically
   and concurrently over a large area. The challenge, therefore, is to
   choose intervention locations that will maximize the effectiveness of
   the control efforts. We propose a novel method to manage dynamic species
   invasions and outbreaks that identifies the intervention locations most
   likely to curtail population expansion by selectively targeting local
   populations most likely to expand their future range. Critically, at any
   point during the development of the invasion or outbreak, the method
   identifies the local intervention that maximizes the long-term benefit
   across the ecosystem by restricting species' potential to spread. In so
   doing, the method adaptively selects the intervention targets under
   dynamically changing circumstances. To illustrate the effectiveness of
   the method we applied it to controlling the spread of crown-of-thorns
   starfish (Acanthaster sp.) outbreaks across Australia's Great Barrier
   Reef. Application of our method resulted in an 18-fold relative
   improvement in management outcomes compared with a random targeting of
   reefs in putative starfish control scenarios. Although we focused on
   applying the method to reducing the spread of an unwanted species, it
   can also be used to facilitate the spread of desirable species through
   connectivity networks. For example, the method could be used to select
   those fragments of habitat most likely to rebuild a population if they
   were sufficiently well protected.
   Control de la Expansion de la Extension en las Redes de Habitats al
   Enfocarse Adaptativamente en las Poblaciones Fuente El control de la
   dispersion de las especies invasoras, las plagas y los patogenos
   generalmente esta limitado logisticamente a las intervenciones que se
   enfocan en localidades especificas durante periodos especificos. Sin
   embargo, en sistemas complejos y muy bien conectados, como los ambientes
   marinos conectados por las corrientes oceanicas, las poblaciones se
   dispersan de manera dinamica tanto en el espacio como en el tiempo a
   traves de enlaces transitorios de conectividad. Lo anterior resulta en
   una distribucion futura no-determinista de las especies, en la que las
   poblaciones locales emergen dinamica y concurrentemente en toda la
   cobertura de un area grande. Por lo tanto, el reto es elegir localidades
   de intervencion que maximizaran la efectividad de los esfuerzos de
   control. Proponemos un metodo novedoso para manejar las invasiones
   dinamicas de las especies y los brotes, el cual identifica las
   localidades de intervencion con mayor probabilidad de restringir las
   expansiones poblacionales al enfocarse selectivamente en las poblaciones
   locales con mayor probabilidad de expandir su extension futura. En
   cualquier momento del desarrollo de la invasion o el brote, el metodo
   identifica de manera critica a la intervencion local que maximiza el
   beneficio a largo plazo en todo el ecosistema al restringir el potencial
   de dispersion de la especie. Al hacer esto, el metodo selecciona
   adaptativamente a los objetivos de la intervencion bajo circunstancias
   cambiantes de forma dinamica. Para ilustrar la efectividad del metodo,
   lo aplicamos al control de la dispersion de los brotes de la estrella de
   mar Acanthaster sp. en la Gran Barrera Arrecifal. La aplicacion de
   nuestro metodo resulto en una mejora relativa 18 veces mayor en los
   resultados de manejo, en comparacion con el enfoque al azar sobre los
   arrecifes en escenarios putativos de control de estrellas de mar. Aunque
   nos enfocamos en aplicar el metodo para reducir la dispersion de
   especies no deseadas, tambien puede usarse para facilitar la dispersion
   de especies deseables en las redes de conectividad. Por ejemplo, el
   metodo podria usarse para seleccionar aquellos fragmentos de habitat con
   mayor probabilidad de reconstruir una poblacion si es protegida
   adecuadamente.

Abstract = {{Rivers and streams that do not flow permanently (herein intermittent
   rivers; IRs) make up a large proportion of the world's inland waters and
   are gaining widespread attention. We review the research on IRs from its
   early focus on natural history through to current application in
   management and policy. The few early studies of the ecology of IRs were
   largely descriptive. Nevertheless, in the 1970s, synthesis of this
   sparse research complemented work on temporary standing waters to found
   a powerful framework for much of the subsequent research on IRs.
   Research on the ecology and biogeochemistry of IRs continues to fuel our
   understanding of resistance and resilience to drying and flooding as
   disturbances. Syntheses of the growing literature, including
   cross-continental and cross-climate comparisons, are revealing the
   generality and individuality of ecological and ecosystem responses to
   flow cessation and surface water loss. Meanwhile, increasing numbers of
   experiments test the causality of these responses. Much of the increased
   consideration of IRs in research, management and policy is driven by the
   observed and projected shifts in flow regimes from perennial to
   intermittent associated with changes in land and water use and climate,
   superimposed on the high incidence of natural intermittency. The need to
   protect and better manage IRs is prompting researchers to develop new or
   modified methods to monitor flow status and assess the ecological
   condition of these systems. Intermittent river research and management
   will benefit from greater exploration of aquatic-terrestrial linkages,
   wet-dry cycling and temporal dynamics, more-detailed mapping and
   predictive modelling of flow intermittency and the application of
   metapopulation and metacommunity concepts alongside multiple-stressors
   and novel-ecosystems research. By building on existing knowledge,
   continuing to develop quantitative models and distribution maps and
   using experiments to test hypotheses and concepts, we can further
   ecological understanding and wise management of these ubiquitous
   ecosystems.}},

   to sudden changes of influent organic load: A modeling study}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{242-249}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Horizontal flow constructed wetlands (HF CWs) have shown a good
   efficiency in the treatment of highly variable influent loads (e.g.
   touristic facilities, stormwater). However, recent studies have
   highlighted the possibilities of HF CW failure in treatment of high
   sudden loads. In order to limit excessive overestimation of the required
   surface area to face sudden loads, a more indepth understanding of HF
   response to time-variable loads is needed. With this objective in mind,
   the response of HF CWs to time-variable loads is investigated using a
   modeling approach. A validated process-based numerical model of a
   laboratory HF CW (1.1 m x 0.76 m x 0.3 m) is used to study the response
   to both hourly and daily sudden loads, according to the specifications
   for the daily load pattern given in the European Standards for testing
   small wastewater treatment plants. During nominal load, the system was
   loaded with 101 of artificial wastewater per day with 954 mg(COD)/l and
   21 mg(NH4-N)/l. In addition to nominal load phase, high and low load
   phases with periods of 2 weeks with 50\% higher and lower organic loads
   were simulated, respectively. The HF CW showed a good capacity to cope
   with the hourly variations, as concentrations at the outlet were
   constant (effluent concentrations of 319 mg COD/l and 108 mg NH4-N/l,
   respectively). During the high load phase, the COD effluent
   concentration was increased by 16\% whereas the NH4-N effluent
   concentrations were decreased by 5\%, respectively. During the low load
   phase, the COD effluent concentrations was decreased by 16\% and the
   NH4-N effluent concentrations increased by 3\%, respectively. After the
   end of the high and low load events, the system was able to recover
   original removal performances. The results of this work provide novel
   insights into the internal processes of a HF CW facing time-variable
   loads, as well as providing interesting insights for future designers.

Abstract = {{Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution continues to be the leading cause of US
   surface water degradation, especially in agricultural areas. In humid
   regions where variable source area (VSA) hydrology dominates storm
   runoff, NPS pollution is generated where VSAs coincide with polluting
   activities. Mapping storm runoff generating areas could allow for more
   precise and informed targeting of NPS pollution mitigation practices in
   agricultural landscapes. Previous efforts to do this have relied on
   simulation models or potentially over-simplifying assumptions about the
   interactions between rainfall and landscape features that generate storm
   runoff. We surveyed volumetric water content (VWC) across five
   agricultural field sites in central New York over two years (2012 to
   2014) and converted these into VWC probability maps based on a soil
   topographic index (STI). We assumed that the threshold for runoff
   occurred when the combination of antecedent soil water and rainfall were
   sufficient to saturate the soil. We combined VWC probability
   distributions with rainfall frequency to determine saturation-excess
   runoff probability. This analysis indicated that the risk of NPS
   pollution in runoff can be reduced by 40\% to 97\% by taking 10\% of the
   highest-runoff-risk agricultural land out of production or halting
   polluting activities in these areas. This approach will be most
   effective if applied to watersheds rather than field-by-field. This
   analysis can be used to determine the optimal placement of conservation
   easements or management practices for the protection of water quality.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{428-439}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Water quality indicators can be used to characterize the status and
   quantify and qualify the change of aquatic ecosystems under different
   disturbance regimes. Although many studies have been done to develop and
   assess indicators and discuss interactions among them, few studies have
   focused on how to improve the predicted indicators and explore their
   variations in receiving water bodies. Accurate and effective predictions
   of ecological indictors are critical to better understand changes of
   water quality in aquatic ecosystems, especially for the real-time
   forecasting. Process-based water quality models can predict the
   spatiotemporal variations of the water quality indicators and provide
   useful information for policy-makers on sound management of water
   resources. Given their inherent constraints, however, such process
   models alone cannot actually guarantee perfect results since water
   quality models generally have a large number of parameters and involve
   many processes which are too complex to be efficiently calibrated. To
   overcome these limitations and explore a fast and efficient forecasting
   method for the change of water quality indictors, we proposed a new
   framework which combines the process-based models and data assimilation
   technique. Unlike most traditional approaches in which only the model
   parameters or initial conditions are updated or corrected and the models
   are run online, this framework allows the information extracted from
   observations and outputs of process models to be directly used in a
   data-driven local/modified local model. The results from the data-driven
   model are then assimilated into the original process model to further
   improve its forecasting ability. This approach can be efficiently run
   offline to directly correct and update the output of water quality
   models. We applied this framework in a real case study in Singapore. Two
   of the water quality indicators, namely salinity and oxygen were
   selected and tested against the observations, suggesting that a good
   performance of improving the model results and reducing computation time
   can be obtained. This approach is simple and efficient, especially
   suitable for real-time forecasting systems. Thus, it can enhance
   forecasting of water quality indictors and thereby facilitate the
   effective management of water resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Aim Much of our current understanding of ecological and evolutionary
   processes comes from island research. With the increasing availability
   of data on distributions and phylogenetic relationships and new
   analytical approaches to understanding the processes that shape species
   distributions and interactions, a re-evaluation of this ever-interesting
   topic is timely.
   Location Islands globally.
   Methods We start by arguing that the reasons why island research has
   achieved so much in the past also apply to the future. We then
   critically assess the current state of island biogeography, focusing on
   recent changes in emphasis, including research featured in this special
   issue of Global Ecology and Biogeography. Finally, we suggest promising
   themes for the future. We cover both ecological and evolutionary topics,
   although the greater emphasis on island ecology reflects our own
   backgrounds and interests.
   Results Much ecological theory has been directly or indirectly
   influenced by research on island biotas. Currently, island biogeography
   is renascent, with research focusing on, among other things, patterns
   and processes underlying species interaction networks, species
   coexistence and the assembly of island communities through ecological
   and evolutionary time. Continuing island research should provide
   additional insight into biological invasions and other impacts of human
   activities, functional diversity and ecosystem functioning, extinction
   and diversification, species pools and more. Deeper understanding of the
   similarities and differences between island and mainland systems will
   aid transferability of island theory to continental regions.
   Main conclusions As research in biogeography and related fields expands
   in new directions, islands continue to provide opportunities for
   developing insights, both as natural laboratories for ecology and
   evolution and because of the exceptions islands often present to the
   usual `rules' of ecology. New data collection initiatives are needed on
   islands world-wide and should be directed towards filling gaps in our
   knowledge of within-island distributions of species, as well as the
   functional traits and phylogenetic relationships of island species.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensors such as Doppler radars are providing novel insights into
   the migrations of diverse animal taxa, but limits in scope and
   sensitivity can hamper the utility of these tools. For example, studies
   investigating whether songbirds compensate effectively for wind
   displacement during nocturnal migration have been challenged by the need
   to assess behavior on a large scale. In addition, these studies
   typically overlook the potential role low-altitude diurnal flights play
   in dealing with unfavorable winds. In such cases, a combination of
   approaches-new and traditional-may be necessary to understand behavior
   more completely. Here, we unite ground-based visual observations with a
   new radar analysis method to investigate how songbirds deal with
   crosswinds over the northeast United States. We find that nocturnally
   migrating birds experienced significant wind drift, even though they
   often flew at 90A degrees or more to the wind direction. Significantly,
   more birds undertook reoriented diurnal flights after nocturnal wind
   drift, and wind influence, nocturnal migration intensity, and time of
   season together explained the majority of variation in counts of these
   ``morning flights.{''} This study shows that bird behavior during
   migration can be strongly shaped by the danger of wind drift and that
   some songbird species respond to drift with reoriented diurnal migratory
   flights. Knowledge of birds' interactions with wind is essential for
   successfully modeling migratory behavior and assessing the risks
   associated with changing habitats and meteorological patterns.
   Furthermore, an understanding of the degree to which drift defines
   migratory behaviors may have value across animal taxa.}},

Abstract = {{The primary purpose of this study was to assess the chironomid species
   diversity of a high-gradient sandy-bottom watershed along the Colorado
   Front Range. Adult male Chironomidae were collected concurrently in 2007
   and 2008 from 14 sites in the Fountain Creek Watershed (FCW), south
   central Colorado, USA, using ultraviolet night lights and sweep netting
   methods. Species-level identifications resulted in 151 species including
   24 new species from 65 genera and 6 subfamilies. Forty species are
   reported here as new Colorado records, and many North American range
   extensions were recorded. Some species had geographical ranges that
   included the Neotropical, Afrotropical or Oriental regions. Species from
   high elevations and northern latitudes were common. Individual species
   accounts include annotated North American distributions, associated
   water quality and sediment (particle size) analyses for each site, and
   ecological notes. Species richness calculations using Jaccard and
   Sorensen similarity indices indicated, with some exceptions, that sites
   in closest proximity shared the most common species. Chironomus decorus
   was the most commonly collected species in the FCW, occurring at 13 of
   14 sites; the orthoclad Cricotopus infuscatus was collected at 12 of the
   sites. In 2007-2008, the FCW had a very diverse chironomid species
   assemblage. How species composition changes in the watershed will be
   influenced by urbanization, global warming, and increased base flows

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{867-874}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Matrix models or integral projection models (IPMs) are commonly used to
   study the dynamics of structured populations, where discrete or
   continuous traits influence survival, growth or reproduction. When a
   population's size is small, as is often the case for threatened species
   or potentially invasive species arriving in novel habitats, extinction
   risk may be substantial due to demographic stochasticity. Branching
   processes, which are individual-based counterparts to matrix models and
   IPMs, allow one to quantify these risks of extinction. For discretely
   structured populations, the theory of multitype branching processes
   provides analytic methods to compute how extinction risk changes over
   time and how it depends on the size and composition of the population.
   Building on prior work on continuous-state branching processes, we
   extend these analytic methods to individual-based models accounting for
   any mixture of discrete and continuous population structure. The
   individual-based IPMs are defined by probabilistic update rules at the
   level of the individual which determine how each individual with a given
   trait value dies, changes trait values (e.g. grows in size) or produces
   individuals with the same or other trait values. We show that
   probabilities of extinction can be analytically determined by
   probability-generating functionals associated with the individual-based
   IPMs. In particular, we present analytical expressions for how
   extinction probabilities change over time and depend on the initial
   abundance and trait distribution of the population. We illustrate how to
   numerically implement these methods using data from the short-lived
   desert shrub species Cryptantha flava and provide a more general
   discussion of how to implement these methods to other data sets
   including those involving fluctuating environmental conditions. As most
   IPM studies have the necessary data to parameterize individual-based
   IPMs, these methods provide a computationally efficient means to explore
   how continuously structured populations differing in their evolutionary
   history and environmental context may differ in their vulnerability to
   extinction or ability to colonize new habitats.}},

Title = {{Using verified species distribution models to inform the conservation of

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{808-822}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Aim Given the paucity of data on the distribution of habitats and
   species for most marine species, particularly those that are rare and in
   need of protection, there is a need to model species distributions.
   Using the fan mussel, Atrina fragilis (Pennant 1777), as our case
   species, the aim of the study was to predict new areas of occurrence for
   A. fragilis, estimate the extent of potentially suitable areas,
   determine the proportion of these areas that are included in the
   recently designated nature conservation MPAs off the west of Scotland
   and identify possible environmental drivers in the distribution of A.
   fragilis.
   Location West coast of Scotland, UK.
   Methods Using a point process framework, we modelled presence-only data,
   including historic records. A quadrat survey employing digital still
   photography was conducted in areas of high and low suitability to verify
   the model, and subsequently, a targeted survey was undertaken in areas
   predicted as highly suitable by the models using towed video cameras.
   Results Five environmental variables were of prime importance in
   explaining the distribution of A. fragilis. The results from the
   verification survey support model performance. Atrina fragilis was found
   in 80\% of the targeted transects undertaken. Approximately 14\% of the
   total area predicted as suitable for A. fragilis occurred within
   recently designated marine protected areas (MPAs) indicating
   considerable potential for recolonization given suitable protection.
   Main conclusions The verified model suggests that limited presence-only
   and historical records of rare species can perform well within a SDM
   framework allowing the identification of further suitable areas. The
   prominence of bathymetric ruggedness in the models is unexpected, given
   the understood ecological niche for A. fragilis and pinnids in general,
   but is consistent with the fact that seabed topography can offer
   protection from fishing pressure. These results will inform restoration
   objectives of the MPA network.}},

Abstract = {{Assessments of future climate change impacts on ecosystems typically
   rely on multiple climate model projections, but often utilize only one
   downscaling approach trained on one set of observations. Here, we
   explore the extent to which modeled biogeochemical responses to changing
   climate are affected by the selection of the climate downscaling method
   and training observations used at the montane landscape of the Hubbard
   Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. We evaluated three
   downscaling methods: the delta method (or the change factor method),
   monthly quantile mapping (Bias Correction-Spatial Disaggregation, or
   BCSD), and daily quantile regression (Asynchronous Regional Regression
   Model, or ARRM). Additionally, we trained outputs from four
   atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) (CCSM3, HadCM3,
   PCM, and GFDL-CM2.1) driven by higher (A1fi) and lower (B1) future
   emissions scenarios on two sets of observations (1/8 degrees resolution
   grid vs. individual weather station) to generate the high-resolution
   climate input for the forest biogeochemical model PnET-BGC (eight
   ensembles of six runs). The choice of downscaling approach and spatial
   resolution of the observations used to train the downscaling model
   impacted modeled soil moisture and streamflow, which in turn affected
   forest growth, net N mineralization, net soil nitrification, and stream
   chemistry. All three downscaling methods were highly sensitive to the
   observations used, resulting in projections that were significantly
   different between station-based and grid-based observations. The choice
   of downscaling method also slightly affected the results, however not as
   much as the choice of observations. Using spatially smoothed gridded
   observations and/or methods that do not resolve sub-monthly shifts in
   the distribution of temperature and/or precipitation can produce biased
   results in model applications run at greater temporal and/or spatial
   resolutions. These results underscore the importance of carefully
   considering field observations used for training, as well as the
   downscaling method used to generate climate change projections, for
   smaller-scale modeling studies. Different sources of variability
   including selection of AOGCM, emissions scenario, downscaling technique,
   and data used for training downscaling models, result in a wide range of
   projected forest ecosystem responses to future climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Weed management is a critically important activity on both agricultural
   and non-agricultural lands, but it is faced with a daunting set of
   challenges: environmental damage caused by control practices, weed
   resistance to herbicides, accelerated rates of weed dispersal through
   global trade, and greater weed impacts due to changes in climate and
   land use. Broad-scale use of new approaches is needed if weed management
   is to be successful in the coming era. We examine three approaches
   likely to prove useful for addressing current and future challenges from
   weeds: diversifying weed management strategies with multiple
   complementary tactics, developing crop genotypes for enhanced weed
   suppression, and tailoring management strategies to better accommodate
   variability in weed spatial distributions. In all three cases,
   proof-of-concept has long been demonstrated and considerable scientific
   innovations have been made, but uptake by farmers and land-managers has
   been extremely limited. Impediments to employing these and other
   ecologically based approaches include inadequate or inappropriate
   government policy instruments, a lack of market mechanisms, and a
   paucity of social infrastructure with which to influence learning,
   decision-making, and actions by farmers and land managers. We offer
   examples of how these impediments are being addressed in different parts
   of the world, but note that there is no clear formula for determining
   which sets of policies, market mechanisms, and educational activities
   will be effective in various locations. Implementing new approaches for
   weed management will require multidisciplinary teams comprised of
   scientists, engineers, economists, sociologists, educators, farmers,
   land managers, industry personnel, policy makers, and others willing to
   focus on weeds within whole farming systems and land management units.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental parameters such as temperature and rainfall have a
   positively autocorrelated variance structure which makes it likely that
   runs of good or bad conditions will occur. It has previously been
   demonstrated that such autocorrelated environmental variance can
   increase the probability of extinction in small populations, in much the
   same way that increased variance without autocorrelation can increase
   extinction risk. As a result, it has also been suggested that positive
   autocorrelation will decrease the probability that a species will
   establish in a novel location. We suggest that describing the
   probability of invasion success as the probability of indefinite
   persistence may be an inappropriate definition of risk. Economic or
   ecological damage may be associated with a population that initially
   reaches high densities before going extinct in the new location. In
   addition, such populations may spread to new locations before
   extirpation. We use a modeling approach to examine the effect of
   positively autocorrelated conditions on the probability that small
   populations will reach large size before extinction. We find that where
   variance is high and the geometric mean of the population growth rate is
   low, autocorrelation increases the risk that a population will pass a an
   upper threshold density, even when extinction probability is unaffected.
   Therefore species classified as having low probability of invasion risk
   on the basis of population growth rates measured in low variance
   environments may actually have quite a substantial probability of
   establishing a large population for a period of time. The mechanism
   behind the effect is the disproportionate influence of short runs of
   good conditions initially following introduction.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient management of biodiversity requires a forward-looking approach
   based on scenarios that explore biodiversity changes under future
   environmental conditions. A number of ecological models have been
   proposed over the last decades to develop these biodiversity scenarios.
   Novel modelling approaches with strong theoretical foundation now offer
   the possibility to integrate key ecological and evolutionary processes
   that shape species distribution and community structure. Although
   biodiversity is affected by multiple threats, most studies addressing
   the effects of future environmental changes on biodiversity focus on a
   single threat only. We examined the studies published during the last
   25years that developed scenarios to predict future biodiversity changes
   based on climate, land-use and land-cover change projections. We found
   that biodiversity scenarios mostly focus on the future impacts of
   climate change and largely neglect changes in land use and land cover.
   The emphasis on climate change impacts has increased over time and has
   now reached a maximum. Yet, the direct destruction and degradation of
   habitats through land-use and land-cover changes are among the most
   significant and immediate threats to biodiversity. We argue that the
   current state of integration between ecological and land system sciences
   is leading to biased estimation of actual risks and therefore constrains
   the implementation of forward-looking policy responses to biodiversity
   decline. We suggest research directions at the crossroads between
   ecological and environmental sciences to face the challenge of
   developing interoperable and plausible projections of future
   environmental changes and to anticipate the full range of their
   potential impacts on biodiversity. An intergovernmental platform is
   needed to stimulate such collaborative research efforts and to emphasize
   the societal and political relevance of taking up this challenge.}},

Abstract = {{AimEvergreen broad-leaved forests (EBLFs) occupy most tropical and
   subtropical regions of mainland Asia and exhibit high species diversity,
   productivity and richness. Understanding the historical dynamics of
   EBLFs is important for biodiversity conservation and regional carbon
   storage and cycling under global climate change. However, little is
   known about the historical dynamics of EBLFs in mainland Asia.
   Dendrobium, an epiphytic orchid genus found in EBLFs, was used to gain
   new insights of the historical establishment and extension of EBLFs in
   mainland Asia.
   LocationMainland Asia.
   MethodsWe sampled c.80\% of the currently recognized species of
   Dendrobium found in mainland Asia. A phylogeny was generated using
   maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. A
   calibrated chronogram was obtained using a Bayesian relaxed-clock model
   approach. Biogeographical scenarios were investigated using the
   statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis and
   dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis methods. Ancestral states were
   constructed by mesquite and bayestraits, and diversification of
   Dendrobium was investigated by APE and LASER packages.
   ResultsOur results indicate that Asian Dendrobium was present on
   mainland Asia since the Oligocene, after which this genus diversified in
   this region and dispersed into higher elevations. The ancestral habit of
   Dendrobium was epiphytic and terrestrial and lithophytic habits each
   have multiple, recently independent origins.
   Main conclusionsOur results support the hypothesis that EBLFs have been
   established in mainland Asia at least since the Oligocene and further
   suggest that the EBLFs of mainland Asia expanded into higher elevations
   prior to the late Cenozoic. The diversification of Asian Dendrobium
   coincided with a warmer climate during the late Oligocene and middle
   Miocene and the expansion of key groups (including Fagaceae, Lauraceae,
   Magnoliaceae and Theaceae) of EBLFs during the early Cenozoic.}},

Abstract = {{Harvest data are often used by wildlife managers when setting harvest
   regulations for species because the data are regularly collected and do
   not require implementation of logistically and financially challenging
   studies to obtain the data. However, when harvest data are not available
   because an area had not previously supported a harvest season,
   alternative approaches are required to help inform management decision
   making. When distribution or density data are required across large
   areas, occupancy modeling is a useful approach, and under certain
   conditions, can be used as a surrogate for density. We collaborated with
   the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) to
   conduct a camera trapping study across a 70,096-km(2) region of southern
   New York in areas that were currently open to fisher (Pekania {[}Martes]
   pennanti) harvest and those that had been closed to harvest for
   approximately 65 years. We used detection-nondetection data at 826 sites
   to model occupancy as a function of site-level landscape characteristics
   while accounting for sampling variation. Fisher occupancy was influenced
   positively by the proportion of conifer and mixed-wood forest within a
   15-km(2) grid cell and negatively associated with road density and the
   proportion of agriculture. Model-averaged predictions indicated high
   occupancy probabilities (>0.90) when road densities were low (<1
   km/km(2)) and coniferous and mixed forest proportions were high (>0.50).
   Predicted occupancy ranged 0.41-0.67 in wildlife management units (WMUs)
   currently open to trapping, which could be used to guide a minimum
   occupancy threshold for opening new areas to trapping seasons. There
   were 5 WMUs that had been closed to trapping but had an average
   predicted occupancy of 0.52 (0.07 SE), and above the threshold of 0.41.
   These areas are currently under consideration by NYSDEC for opening a
   conservative harvest season. We demonstrate the use of occupancy
   modeling as an aid to management decision making when harvest-related
   data are unavailable and when budgetary constraints do not allow for
   capture-recapture studies to directly estimate density. (C) 2016 The

   phenotype. Our study system is Darwin's finches on Floreana Island,
   Galapagos Archipelago, and the virulent fly larvae of Philornis downsi
   that were first discovered in Darwin's finch nests in 1997. We use an
   experimental approach and measure host phenotype in parasitized and
   parasite-free chicks in Darwin's small ground finch (Geospiza
   fuliginosa). Beak size did not differ between the two treatment groups,
   but naris size was 106\% larger in parasitized chicks (similar to 3.3
   mm) versus parasite-free chicks (similar to 1.6 mm). To test if P.
   downsi was present prior to the 1960s, we compared naris size in
   historical (1899-1962) and contemporary birds (2004-2014) on Floreana
   Island in small ground finches (G. fuliginosa) and medium tree finches
   (Camarhynchus pauper). Contemporary Darwin's finches had significantly
   larger naris size (including extreme deformation), whereas historical
   naris size was both smaller and less variable. These findings provide
   the first longitudinal analysis for the extent of P. downsi-induced
   change to host naris size and show that Darwin's finches, prior to the
   1960s, were not malformed. Thus natural selection on altered host
   phenotype as a consequence of P. downsi parasitism appears to be
   contemporary and novel. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, changes have been detected in the climatic niches of
   several non-native species. In spite of this, and although Ecological
   Niche Models (ENMs) assume species show climatic niche conservatism,
   most studies still use ENM to assess the risks of invasion by alien
   species. In this study, we tested how niche expansion of the pond slider
   (Trachemys scripta) differs in invaded continents and how the
   performance of ENMs is affected by different niche shift scenarios. We
   described niche equivalence (whether native and invaded niches are
   identical), unfilling (native niche not present in invasive niche),
   expansion (invasive niche not present in native niche) and stability,
   based on the pond slider native and invaded occurrence points. We
   created an ENM using a Maxent method, based on the native occurrences of
   this turtle, and evaluated the model's performance using invasive
   records. Our results indicate that the pond slider niche changed when
   new areas that were either warmer (Asia and Latin America) or colder
   (Europe) than its native niche were invaded. Processes related to niche
   shift (stability, unfilling, and expansion) varied between continents.
   We also found that niche expansion is not a good predictor of ENM
   performance, which may indicate that the effects of this process on
   model performance are more complex than a simple direct effect. Finally,
   ENMs had especially poor performance when evaluated for sensitivity
   (percentage of presence records correctly predicted as presences in the
   models), reiterating the problems of using ENMs and their traditional
   evaluation methods when focal species do not conserve their native
   niche. We draw attention to important mitigatory measures, such as
   environmental education and strong control of trade to manage invasion
   by the pond slider turtle, since we still lack standard methods to
   predict the potential invasion risks for new areas when focal species do
   not conserve their native niche.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{138-147}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Eco-engineering techniques involve the use of both plants and inert
   materials where, in the latter, non treated wood is usually present. The
   two different elements will both evolve with time and change their
   mechanical properties differently. On one hand, the wood will degrade
   decreasing its effective cross sectional area with time. On the other
   hand, the live plant material will grow and propagate new roots as time
   progresses. Both root development and inert material changes must be
   accounted for in order to realistically simulate a bioengineered slope
   evolution and design effective eco-engineering solutions.
   The dynamic nature of a bioengineered work sets different scenarios
   throughout the slope design life. All these different stages must be
   taken into account in the work design process. In this work, we propose
   an adaptation of the existing routines and procedures of both
   geotechnical practice and civil engineering design scheme in order to
   closely reflect the inclusion of bioengineering methods in the classic
   geotechnical engineering problems. A design methodology covering
   different critical points within the lifecycle of a bioengineered slope
   is proposed and put into practice into the design stage for a case study
   in Scotland. By detecting critical points at the design stage the
   proposed methodology was proven to offer an improved eco-engineering
   work design scheme. With the use of the proposed method both external
   and internal stability checks with their corresponding safety factor
   values increase with time and there are no conflicts between the two
   evolving processes involved in this kind of works. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The availability of the primary limiting nutrient plays a major role in
   driving the productivity, biomass and community composition of coastal
   phytoplankton, but there is an ongoing challenge to define the
   relationship between nutrient enrichment and phytoplankton response.
   This study explored a new indicator (N95) for quantifying nutrient
   response in natural phytoplankton communities. In this study, N95
   specifically represented the required nitrogen addition (normalised to
   chlorophyll a) for the sampled phytoplankton population to reach 95\% of
   nitrogenreplete photosynthetic efficiency. To calculate N95, an
   asymptotic model was applied to measures of phytoplankton photosynthetic
   efficiency (F-v/F-m) taken after 24 h incubations under a range of
   nitrogen enrichment treatments. Applying the method in an Australian
   subtropical bay, Moreton Bay, nitrogen response was lowest nearshore and
   high, yet variable, offshore. This pattern reflected the ambient
   nutrient gradient of declining concentrations with distance offshore. A
   Moreton Bay-specific threshold in phytoplankton nutrient response was
   identified at the ambient dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration of
   2 mu mol l(-1), above which the response to nitrogen enrichment did not
   increase for 82\% of samples. Advantages to measuring N95 were that
   incubations were simple to set up, incubation period was short, and
   F-v/F-m measures were simple to make. This approach advances options for
   using F-v/F-m measures to assess phytoplankton nutrient response and
   provides a new and sensitive biological indicator applicable to
   long-term water quality monitoring programs, relevant to parameterising
   ecological models and supporting decision making on nutrient management.}},

Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem research benefits enormously from the fact that comprehensive
   data sets of high quality, and covering long time periods are now
   increasingly more available. However, facing apparently complex
   interdependencies between numerous ecosystem components, there is urgent
   need rethinking our approaches in ecosystem research and applying new
   tools of data analysis.
   The concept presented in this paper is based on two pillars. Firstly, it
   postulates that ecosystems are multiple feedback systems and thus are
   highly constrained. Consequently, the effective dimensionality of
   multivariate ecosystem data sets is expected to be rather low compared
   to the number of observables. Secondly, it assumes that ecosystems are
   characterized by continuity in time and space as well as between
   entities which are often treated as distinct units.
   Implementing this concept in ecosystem research requires new tools for
   analysing large multivariate data sets. This study presents some of
   them, which were applied to a comprehensive water quality data set from
   a long-term monitoring program in Northeast Germany in the Uckermark
   region, one of the LTER-D (Long Term Ecological Research network,
   Germany) sites.
   The effective dimensionality was assessed by the Correlation Dimension
   approach as well as by a Principal Component Analysis and was in fact
   substantially lower than the number of observables. Continuity in time,
   space and between different types of water bodies was studied by
   combining Self-Organizing Maps with Sammon's Mapping. Groundwater,
   kettle hole and stream water samples exhibited some overlap, confirming
   continuity between different types of water bodies. Clear long-term
   shifts were found at the stream sampling sites. There was strong
   evidence that the intensity of single processes had changed at these
   sites rather than that new processes developed. Thus the more recent
   data did not occupy new subregions of the phase space of observations.
   Short-term variability of the kettle hole water samples differed
   substantially from that of the stream water samples, suggesting
   different processes generating the dynamics in these two types of water
   bodies. However, again, this seemed to be due to differing intensities
   of single processes rather than to completely different processes.
   We feel that research aiming at elucidating apparently complex
   interactions in ecosystems could make much more efficient use from now
   available large monitoring data sets by implementing the suggested
   concept and using corresponding innovative tools of system analysis. (C)

Abstract = {{There is growing public interest and participation in food-producing
   urban community gardens in North America, yet little research has
   examined agricultural production and ecological processes in these
   spaces. We describe the agroecological and social characteristics of 61
   food-producing gardens in New York City, drawing on gardener interviews,
   land-use maps, plant species inventories, arthropod scouting, and soil
   sampling and analysis. Gardens contained agricultural crops, food
   production infrastructure, ornamental plants, and recreational areas in
   varying proportions, indicating that gardens serve multiple and distinct
   purposes depending on community needs and interests. On average,
   gardeners devoted the greatest proportion of garden area (44 \%) to food
   production, and supplied a large share of their households' produce
   needs from their community gardens. Solanaceae, Brassicaceae, and
   Cucurbitaceae crops dominated food crop areas, hindering effective crop
   rotation to prevent disease and pest problems. Most gardeners grew crops
   in raised beds constructed with clean fill and compost. These soils
   generally had sandy textures, low water-holding capacity, high organic
   matter levels (with a large proportion from recent inputs) and excessive
   nutrient levels. Soil water content at field capacity increased
   exponentially with total soil carbon, suggesting that organic matter
   enhances water-holding capacity. Insect pest densities greatly exceeded
   action thresholds in nearly all gardens for aphids and whiteflies on
   Brassica crops, aphids on Cucurbit crops, and two-spotted spider mites
   on tomatoes. Predator and parasitoid densities were generally low (less
   than one per plant on average), perhaps partially due to low floral and
   woody perennial cover in most gardens (12 \% and 9 \% on average,
   respectively). Dominant groups of natural enemies were minute pirate
   bugs, spiders, and parasitoid wasps. A wide variety of people of
   differing experience levels, incomes, and ethnicities participate in
   community gardening in NYC, and most gardens host multiple languages.
   Promising directions for urban gardening research, education, and
   practice include: 1) Cover cropping to improve soil quality and nutrient
   management, and diversify crop rotations; 2) Improving access to soil
   testing and guidance on appropriate use of soil amendments, 3) Enhancing
   habitat for arthropod natural enemies that provide biological control of
   insect pests with floral and woody perennial plantings; and 4)
   Incorporating ecological knowledge and inquiry-based approaches into
   gardening workshops, educational materials, and technical support, and
   offering these resources in multiple languages.}},

Abstract = {{1. Anthropogenic stressors affect the ecosystems upon which humanity

   reduce spread}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{742-750}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Models of the spread of invasive species in transportation networks
   often assume a constant probability of transport across vectors, an
   assumption that is known to be false. The human dimension of these
   pathways is an important contributor to variation in vector risks. Yet,
   little attempt has been made to understand the effectiveness of
   strategies that involve changing risky behaviours.
   2. We modelled the efficacy of management campaigns that aim to reduce
   the spread of invasive biofouling organisms by improving antifouling
   behaviour of boaters. We examined the influence of three factors on the
   effectiveness of the campaigns: (i) the proportion of the vessel
   population that is targeted by the measure, (ii) the average amount of
   change in behaviour made by individual boaters and (iii) the rate of
   uptake of the measure by the targeted population.
   3. The modelled campaigns reduced the spread of an invasive species
   within New Zealand's recreational boating network by 0-56\% over a
   10-year period. The outcome depended strongly on the combination of the
   three factors examined.
   4. Strategies that targeted only the `worst offenders' caused relatively
   little reduction in spread unless there was very high uptake of the
   measure (>75\% compliance) and a larger shift from current practice than
   could reasonably be expected. In comparison, a strategy that utilized a
   lower threshold for renewing the coatings and targeted a larger
   proportion of boaters was three times more effective, even for modest
   changes in current behaviour.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Vector management can be effective in
   reducing the spread of a marine invader, but campaigns need to be well
   designed if they are to be effective. Their success will be determined
   by the shape of the `risk-release relationship' and where along this
   curve the population of vectors lies. Greatest gains are likely when
   measures are targeted at critical transition points, where relatively
   small changes in behaviour lead to a considerable reduction in risk.
   High uptake of measures is required to reduce spread significantly.
   Combined `carrot and stick' approaches that incorporate incentives for
   compliance are likely to be most effective at eliciting meaningful
   levels of change.}},

Abstract = {{Abundance estimates are used to establish baselines, set recovery
   targets, and assess management actions, all of which are essential
   aspects of evidence-based natural resource management. For many rare
   butterflies, these estimates do not exist, and conservation decisions
   rely instead on expert opinion. Using Bartram's scrub-hairstreak
   (Strymon acis bartrami, US Endangered) as a case study, we present a
   novel comparison of two methods that permit the incorporation of
   detection probabilities into abundance estimates, distance sampling and
   double-observer surveys. Additionally we provide a framework for
   establishing a systematic sampling scheme for monitoring very rare
   butterflies. We surveyed butterflies monthly in 2013, increasing
   intensity to weekly when butterflies were detected. We conducted 19
   complete, island-wide surveys on Big Pine Key in the Florida Keys,
   detecting a total of 59 Bartram's scrub-hairstreaks across all surveys.
   Peak daily abundances were similar as estimated with distance sampling,
   156 butterflies (95 \% CI 65-247), and double-observer, 169 butterflies
   (95 \% CI 65-269). Selecting a method for estimating abundance of rare
   species involves evaluating trade-offs between methods. Distance
   sampling requires at least 40 detections, but only one observer, while
   double-observer requires only 10 detections, but two observers.
   Double-observer abundance estimates agreed with distance sampling
   estimates, which suggests that double-observer is a reasonable
   alternative method to use for estimating detection probability and
   abundance for rare species that cannot be surveyed with other, more
   commonly used methods.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Heterotrophic respiration (HR), the aerobic and anaerobic processes
   mineralizing organic matter, is a key carbon flux but one impossible to
   measure at scales significantly larger than small experimental plots.
   This impedes our ability to understand carbon and nutrient cycles,
   benchmark models, or reliably upscale point measurements. Given that a
   new generation of highly mechanistic, genomic-specific global models is
   not imminent, we suggest that a useful step to improve this situation
   would be the development of ``Decomposition Functional Types{''} (DFTs).
   Analogous to plant functional types (PFTs), DFTs would abstract and
   capture important differences in HR metabolism and flux dynamics,
   allowing modelers and experimentalists to efficiently group and vary
   these characteristics across space and time. We argue that DFTs should
   be initially informed by top-down expert opinion, but ultimately
   developed using bottom-up, data-driven analyses, and provide specific
   examples of potential dependent and independent variables that could be
   used. We present an example clustering analysis to show how annual HR
   can be broken into distinct groups associated with global variability in
   biotic and abiotic factors, and demonstrate that these groups are
   distinct from (but complementary to) already-existing PFTs. A similar
   analysis incorporating observational data could form the basis for
   future DFTs. Finally, we suggest next steps and critical priorities:
   collection and synthesis of existing data; more in-depth analyses
   combining open data with rigorous testing of analytical results; using
   point measurements and realistic forcing variables to constrain
   process-based models; and planning by the global modeling community for
   decoupling decomposition from fixed site data. These are all critical
   steps to build a foundation for DFTs in global models, thus providing
   the ecological and climate change communities with robust, scalable
   estimates of HR.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation services are the ecosystem processes and services that
   benefit people by increasing their ability to adapt to change. Benefits
   may accrue from existing but newly used services where ecosystems
   persist or from novel services supplied following ecosystem
   transformation. Ecosystem properties that enable persistence or
   transformation are important adaptation services because they support
   future options. The adaptation services approach can be applied to
   decisions on trade-offs between currently valued services and benefits
   from maintaining future options. For example, ecosystem functions and
   services of floodplains depend on river flows. In those regions of the
   world where climate change projections are for hotter, drier conditions,
   floods will be less frequent and floodplains will either persist, though
   with modified structure and function, or transform to terrestrial
   (flood-independent) ecosystems. Many currently valued ecosystem services
   will reduce in supply or become unavailable, but new options are
   provided by adaptation services. We present a case study from the
   Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, for operationalizing the adaptation
   services concept for floodplains and wetlands. We found large changes in
   flow and flood regimes are likely under a scenario of +1.6 degrees C by
   2030, even with additional water restored to rivers under the proposed
   Murray-Darling Basin Plan. We predict major changes to floodplain
   ecosystems, including contraction of riparian forests and woodlands and
   expansion of terrestrial, drought-tolerant vegetation communities.
   Examples of adaptation services under this scenario include substitution
   of irrigated agriculture with dryland cropping and floodplain grazing;
   mitigation of damage from rarer, extreme floods; and increased tourism,
   recreational, and cultural values derived from fewer, smaller wetlands
   that can be maintained with environmental flows. Management for
   adaptation services will require decisions on where intervention can
   enable ecosystem persistence and where transformation is inevitable. New
   ways of managing water that include consideration of the increasing
   importance of adaptation services requires major changes to
   decision-making that better account for landscape heterogeneity and
   large-scale change rather than attempting to maintain ecosystems in
   fixed states.}},

Abstract = {{The sharp-angled (presence of an acute ridge) or rounded (absence of an
   acute ridge) transition of the ventral and dorsal shell surfaces is the
   ``key feature{''} for the distinction of Dreissena polymorpha and
   Dreissena rostriformis. However, up to now it has not been possible to
   put this into a quantifiable framework. Therefore, the aim of this study
   was to develop a method, which (i) facilitates the quantification of
   this feature as a morphometric parameter and (ii) to test whether the
   presence or absence of an acute ridge can be used to distinguish the two
   species both in mathematical terms and under field conditions. We called
   the new parameter ` angularity' (An) and developed a method for its
   quantification. An <= 3.3 and An >= 4.7 were the discriminant thresholds
   for quagga mussels and zebra mussels, respectively. 3.3 < An < 4.7 did
   not allow for a clear distinction between species. Nevertheless, An is
   highly sensitive in morphometrically discriminating both species: more
   than 96\% of the mussels were correctly classified whereas less than 1\%
   were falsely classified. We conducted a visuo-haptic experiment in which
   we asked test persons to rate mussels according to their angularity
   (acute ridge present vs. absent). Remarkably, our results revealed that
   all participants were well able to distinguish the species at an error
   rate of 8.4 \%. Nevertheless, even naive persons who have no previous
   knowledge of dreissenid mussels can reliably select specimens of zebra
   and quagga mussels under field conditions based on the angularity alone.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   Natural and anthropogenic changes in forests can have important
   influences on transpiration and water production. Understanding the
   effects of increasing disturbances, due for example to climate change
   and forest harvesting, requires detailed information on how forest
   density and structural attributes relate to transpiration. Mean annual
   transpiration of eucalypt forest communities is often strongly
   correlated with total cross-sectional sapwood area. Our aim was to test
   an efficient method for estimating sapwood area at 1.3 m height
   (SA(1.3)) in a large number of trees to understand the spatial
   heterogeneity of tree and stand sapwood area within and between forest
   communities, and develop allometric relationships that predict SA(1.3)
   with forest inventory data. We also apply tree competition models to
   determine the degree to which the relationship between SA(1.3) and tree
   basal area at 1.3 m height (BA(1.3)) is influenced by competition.
   Methods
   We visited 25 recently harvested southeastern Australian forest sites
   consisting of 1379 trees and 5 Eucalyptus species to evaluate a new
   efficient data collection method for estimating SA(1.3) with tree taper
   and stump dimensions data using mixed effects models. The locations of
   784 stumps within one 5-ha site were accurately mapped using an unmanned
   aerial vehicle (UAV), and four distance-dependent tree competition
   models were applied across the site to explain within-stand variation in
   the ratio of SA(1.3) to BA (1.3). Data from 24 additional sites,
   consisting of ten 15 m radial plots per site, were used to analyse
   within-site variation in R-Ha (the ratio of stand sapwood area SA(Ha) to
   stand basal area BA(Ha)). The radial plots were merged within each site
   to evaluate between-site variations in R-Ha across the landscape. For
   predicting SA(Ha) with forest inventory data, we computed the
   relationship between SA(Ha) and a new index of total stem perimeter per
   hectare, defined as root BA(Ha) N-T, where N-T is tree stocking density.
   Important Findings
   Our 1379 measured stems represent the most comprehensive measure of
   sapwood area, surpassing the 757 measured stems in native eucalypt
   forests published in literature. The species-specific R-Ha varied
   considerably across sites and therefore extrapolating SA(Ha) with
   spatially distributed BA(Ha) maps and a generalized R-Ha would introduce
   local uncertainty. We found that the species-specific stem perimeter
   index was more effective at capturing variability in SA(Ha) across the
   landscape using forest composition, structure and density data (R-2:
   0.72-0.77). The strong correlation between tree SA(1.3) and BA(1.3)
   improved slightly using tree competition models (R-2 increased from 0.86
   to 0.88). Relating SA(Ha) to routinely measured forest inventory
   attributes within permanent plots and Light Detection and Ranging
   (LiDAR) data may provide opportunities to map forest water use in time
   and space across large areas disturbed by wildfire and logging.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we apply a dynamic modelling approach to analyse the
   habitat loss of the Canarian houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata
   fuerteventurae). This tool allows us to assess the effects of the
   socio-economic and environmental interactions on the factors threatening
   the habitat and to carry out a prospective analysis. The results show a
   potential habitat loss of around 13 \% during the period 1996-2011, the
   land uptake and increase in new roads and tracks being the factors
   contributing most. After model testing, a set of scenarios was explored.
   Under the business as usual (BAU) scenario, around 20 \% of the habitat
   would be lost by the end of the period considered (2012-2025). The
   impact of the economic growth scenario on the habitat would mean an
   additional loss of around 21 \% with respect to BAU, whereas under the
   recession scenario, the loss might be around 6.5 \% lower than BAU. The
   policy of restoration of gavias-traditional farming systems-would
   suppose an additional loss of almost 6 \%, relative to BAU. If this
   policy took place under economic growth conditions, it might mean an
   additional loss of almost 28 \% relative to BAU. These results point to
   the existence of a potential trade-off between the recuperation of
   ecosystem services offered by restored gavias and the conservation of
   the houbara habitat, which must be addressed within the management
   processes, as well as to the need for compensatory measures to guarantee
   the conservation goals.}},

   Using a suite of modelling techniques, weighted averaging (WA), weighted
   averaging partial least squares, modern-analogue technique (MAT) and two
   machine learning techniques, boosted regression trees (BRT) and random
   forests (RF), we calibrated models to infer water quality and climatic

Abstract = {{Coastal development that converts mangrove forests to other uses has
   constantly ignored ecological services of mangrove forests. Monitoring
   spatiotemporal changes of mangrove forests is thus important to provide
   economists, ecologists, and forest managers with valuable information to
   improve management strategies for mangrove ecosystems. This study
   developed an approach to investigate spatiotemporal changes of mangrove
   forests in Can Gio Biosphere Reserve, South Vietnam using Landsat data
   during periods 1989-1996, 1996-2003, 2003-2009, and 2009-2014. The data
   were processed through three main steps: (1) data pre-processing to
   perform geometric corrections and reflectance normalization, (2)
   mangrove extraction using the tasselled cap transformation (TCT) and
   unmixing model, and (3) accuracy assessment of the mapping results. The
   comparisons between the mapping results and the ground reference data
   indicated that the overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients were
   generally higher than 90 \% and 0.8, respectively. From 1989 to 2014,
   approximately 24 \% of mangrove forests had been transformed to other
   land uses, especially aquaculture farms, while 41 \% was reforested or

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) losses constrain rates of plant carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake
   and storage in many ecosystems globally. N isotope models have been used
   to infer that similar to 30 \% of terrestrial N losses occur via
   microbial denitrification; however, this approach assumes a small
   isotope effect associated with N leaching losses. Past work across
   tropical/sub-tropical forest sites has confirmed this expectation;
   however, the stable N isotope ratio (delta N-15) of ecosystem leaching
   has yet to be systematically evaluated in seasonally dry climates or
   across major ecosystem disturbances. We here present new measurements of
   the delta N-15 of total dissolved N (TDN) in small streams, bulk
   deposition, and soil pools across eight watershed sites in California,
   including grassland, chaparral, and coastal redwood forest ecosystems,
   with and without fire, grazing, and forest harvesting. Regardless of the
   dominant vegetation type or disturbance regime, average delta N-15 of
   TDN in stream water differed only slightly (<similar to 1 aEuro degrees)
   from that of bulk soil delta N-15, revealing a uniformly small isotope
   effect associated with N leaching losses even under non-steady state
   conditions. Rather, lower input delta N-15 compared to TDN delta N-15 in
   streams pointed to fractionations via gaseous loss pathways as the
   dominant mechanism behind soil delta N-15 enrichment. We conclude that N
   leaching does not impart a major isotope effect across a broad range of
   ecosystems and conditions examined, thereby advancing the N gas-loss
   hypothesis as the principal explanation for variation in bulk soil delta
   N-15.}},

Abstract = {{Aim We aim to assess the temporary transferability of species
   distribution models (SDMs) for stream fish species in terms of
   discrimination power and calibration.
   Location New River basin, eastern United States.
   Methods In this study, we used Lasso-regularized logistic regression
   (LLR), boosted regression trees (BRT), MaxEnt, and ensemble model (ENS)
   to evaluate the habitat suitability of 16 fish species with different
   rarity and temperature preference based on historical species
   occurrences obtained during 1950-1990. These SDMs were used to make
   probabilistic predictions of species presence in the independent
   datasets sampled during 2012-2014. We evaluated the temporal
   transferability of these SDMs in terms of discrimination power and
   calibration with the temporarily independent datasets.
   Results The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC)
   was over 0.6 for 13 (81\%) of the species in the evaluations of ENS
   models with the independent datasets. Cool-water species and species
   with small local population size traits tended to have good temporal
   transferability. With observed species prevalence as the discrimination
   cut-off, LLR had the highest overall accuracy for 13 of the 16 species
   and highest specificity for 10 species, whereas MaxEnt had the highest
   sensitivity for 14 species. Biases, under-or over-fitting problems were
   common in the temporal model transfers, among the modelling approaches
   used here.
   Main conclusions SDMs developed with historical data generally had
   moderate to good discrimination power but they tended to systematically
   underestimate current probability of species presence. To predict
   species distribution shifts over time, SDMs should be well-calibrated
   with high discrimination power. We suggest reclassifying predicted
   probability of species occurrence to ordinal ranks to deal with
   (under-and over-estimation) bias, and fine-tuning variable selection
   with regularization or cross validation to remedy under-and
   over-fitting.}},

Abstract = {{Migratory animals often go to extraordinary lengths to follow
   broad-scale changes in the spatial distributions of food resources over
   time. An example is the molt-migration system of songbirds in the
   central and western United States, wherein birds interrupt migratory
   movements to molt their feathers in the ephemerally productive North
   American monsoon region in Northwestern Mexico. Within this large-scale
   migration system, the efficacy of individual migration behaviors
   relative to dynamics of primary productivity en route is unknown. We
   performed a comparison of real migration tracks from a common molt
   migrant, the painted bunting (Passerina ciris), with the results from
   millions of random-walk simulations to determine if real birds
   demonstrate optimal migratory behavior with respect to seasonal changes
   in primary productivity across the landscape. We scored migration routes
   of both real and simulated birds using an index of new plant growth,
   wherein daily values for each day of the autumn migration period were
   summed to indicate the total exposure to primary productivity. We then
   compared the highest-scoring simulated routes with real bird tracks and
   observed a high degree of correspondence between them, with the monsoon
   region featuring prominently in most of the high-ranking simulations.
   However, real birds generally left the breeding grounds later than
   virtual birds, perhaps because of life-history constraints not
   represented in the simulations. Our work supports the contention that
   painted bunting migration maximizes exposure to new plant growth and
   provides a novel approach for exploring migratory behaviors in other
   species and other regions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Pollution is a global issue at the frontier between ecology,
   environmental science, management, engineering and policy. Legislation
   requires experiments to determine how much contamination an ecosystem
   can absorb before there are structural or functional changes. Yet,
   existing methods cannot realistically simulate regimes of chemical
   disturbance and determine impacts to assemblages in ecosystems. This is
   because they lack ecologically relevant species and biotic interactions,
   are logistically difficult to set up and lack environmentally relevant
   regimes of chemical and abiotic disturbance that organisms experience in
   polluted areas.
   2. We solved these long-standing environmental, logistical, experimental
   and ecological problems by developing a programmable dosing system. This
   dosing system simulates, in situ, regimes of chemical disturbance to
   assemblages by manipulating the concentration, duration, timing and
   frequency of pollutants to which they are exposed.
   3. Experiments with priority pollutants (the metal copper and the
   biocide chlorpyrifos) and mussel assemblages revealed consistent plumes
   of contamination within patches of mussel. Mussels at the sources of
   experimental plumes of copper created by the dosing system, accumulated
   670\% more copper in their tissues compared to mussels 0.5-50 m away. In
   addition, when mussels were exposed to increasing concentrations of
   copper, there was a concomitant increase in the amount of copper in the
   tissues of mussels. Combining the dosing system with an established
   hierarchy of ecotoxicological assays revealed mussel assemblages exposed
   to copper and/or chlorpyrifos had 40-70\% fewer worms, whilst
   chlorpyrifos alone caused an 81\% reduction in the number of amphipods
   and caused mussels to filter 48\% fewer particles from the water.
   Combinations of copper and/or chlorpyrifos had no effects on the
   abundance of crabs, the respiratory functions of assemblages or the
   viability of molluscan haemocytes.
   4. As global contamination accelerates, we discuss how this
   technological advance will enable a diverse array of ecologists, mangers
   and policy-makers to understand and reduce pollution.}},

   and wildlife populations represents a growing threat to veterinary and
   human health. In light of these trends and the scarcity of long-term
   time series data on infection rates among vectors and reservoirs, the
   National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) will collect measurements
   and samples of a suite of tick-, mosquito-, and rodent-borne parasites
   through a continental-scale surveillance program. Here, we describe the
   sampling designs for these efforts, highlighting sampling priorities,
   field and analytical methods, and the data as well as archived samples
   to be made available to the research community. Insights generated by
   this sampling will advance current understanding of and ability to
   predict changes in infection and disease dynamics in novel,
   interdisciplinary, and collaborative ways.}},

Abstract = {{Chromosomal inversions are important structural changes that may
   facilitate divergent selection when they capture co-adaptive loci in the
   face of gene flow. However, identifying selection targets within
   inversions can be challenging. The high degrees of differentiation
   between heterokaryotypes, as well as the differences in demographic
   histories of collinear regions compared with inverted ones, reduce the
   power of traditional outlier analyses for detecting selected loci. Here,
   we develop a new approach that uses discriminant functions informed from
   inversion-specific expectations to classify loci that are under
   selection (or drift). Analysis of RAD sequencing data we collected in a
   classic dipteran species with polymorphic inversion clines-Anopheles
   gambiae, a malaria vector species from sub-Saharan Africa-demonstrates
   the benefits of the approach compared with traditional outlier analyses.
   We focus specifically on two polymorphic inversions, the 2La and 2Rb
   arrangements that predominate in dry habitats and the 2L(+a) and 2R(+b)
   arrangements in wet habitats, which contrast with the minimal geographic
   structure of SNPs from collinear regions. With our approach, we identify
   two strongly selected regions within 2La associated with dry habitat.
   Moreover, we also show that the prevalence of selection is greater in
   the arrangement 2L(+a) that is associated with wet habitat (unlike
   presumed importance of selective divergence associated with the shift of
   the mosquitoes into dry habitats). We discuss the implications of these
   results with respect to studies of rapid adaptation in these malaria
   vectors, and in particular, the insights our newly developed approach
   offers for identifying not only potential targets of selection, but also
   the population that has undergone adaptive change.}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of grassland to oil palm is expected to increase
   throughout tropical regions where oil palm grows. Given the extent of
   land use change, there are concerns associated with impacts on ecosystem
   function and nutrient cycling. For this work, soil samples were
   collected in Papua New Guinea from 15 sites with oil palm (planted on
   grassland) and adjacent remnant grassland. Using DNA-based approaches,
   bacterial and fungal community composition was assessed in each sample,
   along with abundance of genes involved in key nitrogen cycling steps:
   nitrification (bacterial and archaeal amoA genes), nitrite reduction
   (nirS gene), and nitrous oxide reduction (nosZ gene). Across all
   microbial properties measured, variation among sites was greater than
   variation due to land use change. This was driven by among-site
   variation in soil physicochemical properties, particularly total soil
   organic carbon content and delta C-13, electrical conductivity,
   exchangeable calcium, potassium and magnesium content, and extractable
   phosphorus content. The results suggest that in this environment,
   routinely measured soil properties such as soil pH, organic carbon, and
   exchangeable cation contents may serve as indicators for the effects of
   land use and management on soil microbial community composition and

   Implications of woody restoration for herbaceous vegetation}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{140-146}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Extensive degraded short tussock grasslands of New Zealand's eastern
   South Island were dominated by woody vegetation prior to burning and
   livestock grazing associated with human settlement starting 800 years
   ago. There is increasing interest in restoring some of these grasslands
   back to a woody state. However, because of the long time frames involved
   in establishing a woody cover, it is difficult to predict the impacts
   that woody restoration will have on the extant herbaceous flora. Using a
   factorial trial with artificial shade and grazing exclusion, we assessed
   the potential impact of woody restoration on the structure and
   composition of the herbaceous flora over a six-year period. The
   imposition of artificial shade resulted in significant increases in
   total species richness and the total cover of herbaceous vegetation,
   increases in cover of several individual forb and grass species and
   decreases in the cover of bare ground, moss and lichen in shade
   treatments. There were also changes in the overall community composition
   of shaded treatments reflecting these changes in vegetation cover and
   species richness. We found no statistically significant effects of
   grazing exclusion. We suggest that increased soil moisture resulting
   from shade addition plays an important role in increasing the herbaceous
   component of the flora. While woody restoration will have a range of
   effects on the herbaceous understorey, for example through competition
   and changes in soil conditions, our findings are important for planning
   future woody restoration in these degraded tussock grasslands. In
   particular, our results suggest that the best approach to ensure the
   persistence of herbaceous vegetation in woody restorations might be to
   ensure that restoration plantings result in a spatially heterogeneous
   vegetation arrangement.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use change is one of the biggest threats to biodiversity globally.
   The effects of land use on biodiversity manifest primarily at local
   scales which are not captured by the coarse spatial grain of current
   global land-use mapping. Assessments of land-use impacts on biodiversity
   across large spatial extents require data at a similar spatial grain to
   the ecological processes they are assessing. Here, we develop a method
   for statistically downscaling mapped land-use data that combines
   generalized additive modeling and constrained optimization. This method
   was applied to the 0.5 degrees Land-use Harmonization data for the year
   2005 to produce global 30 `' (approx. 1 km(2)) estimates of five
   land-use classes: primary habitat, secondary habitat, cropland, pasture,
   and urban. The original dataset was partitioned into 61 bio-realms
   (unique combinations of biome and biogeographical realm) and downscaled
   using relationships with fine-grained climate, land cover, landform, and
   anthropogenic influence layers. The downscaled land-use data were
   validated using the PREDICTS database and the geoWiki global cropland
   dataset. Application of the new method to all 61 biorealms produced
   global fine-grained layers from the 2005 time step of the Land-use
   Harmonization dataset. Coarse-scaled proportions of land use estimated
   from these data compared well with those estimated in the original
   datasets (mean R-2: 0.68 +/- 0.19). Validation with the PREDICTS
   database showed the new downscaled land-use layers improved
   discrimination of all five classes at PREDICTS sites (P < 0.0001 in all
   cases). Additional validation of the downscaled cropping layer with the
   geoWiki layer showed an R-2 improvement of 0.12 compared with the
   Land-use Harmonization data. The downscaling method presented here
   produced the first global land-use dataset at a spatial grain relevant
   to ecological processes that drive changes in biodiversity over space
   and time. Integrating these data with biodiversity measures will enable
   the reporting of land-use impacts on biodiversity at a finer resolution
   than previously possible. Furthermore, the general method presented here
   could be useful to others wishing to downscale similarly constrained
   coarse-resolution data for other environmental variables.}},

Abstract = {{In northern New Mexico, complex interactions among climate, land use,
   and the associated reduction of surface fire in forest and savanna
   communities facilitated the expansion of pinon-juniper woodlands.
   Because increasing tree cover can outcompete herbaceous vegetation
   (e.g., forbs and grasses), woodland expansion resulted in reduced
   herbaceous cover and increased soil exposure, leading to increased
   runoff and erosion. To improve hydrologic function in these degraded
   woodlands, an overstory thinning and slash-mulch treatment was applied
   to more than 1 000 hectares within Bandelier National Monument (New
   Mexico, United States) between 2007 and 2010. Our objective was to
   develop a remote sensing strategy to quantify land-cover changes
   following mechanical treatment of pinon-juniper woodlands. In this
   study, we 1) established a simple and repeatable method for assessing
   treatment effectiveness using high-resolution satellite imagery, 2)
   quantified vegetation response at six times since treatment (from 0.5 to
   3.5 years), and 3) delineated areas of degraded woodland before and
   after treatment. We classified a 2006 QuickBird satellite image (before
   treatment) and a 2011 WorldView image (after treatment) to map tree
   cover, herbaceous cover, bare soil, and shadow with average overall
   accuracies of 95.0\% and 94.7\% for the 2006 and 2011 images,
   respectively. Following treatment, average tree cover, bare soil, and
   bare soil patch size decreased 9\%, 4\%, and 18\%, respectively, while
   herbaceous cover increased 14\%. Overall, the total amount of woodland
   area classified as degraded decreased by 34\% post treatment. By
   comparison, control areas remained relatively unchanged across the same
   time period. Our results demonstrate the utility and promise of
   high-resolution satellite imagery to inform rapid and objective
   assessments of landscape-scale restoration treatments. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Aim Salt-marsh foraminifera are widely used as robust sea-level
   indicators. High-resolution Holocene sea-level reconstructions depend on
   the accurate characterization of modern foraminifera-environment
   relationships representative of a study site. We investigate the
   relationship between modern foraminiferal assemblage distribution and
   key environmental variables, viz. elevation above land levelling datum
   (LLD), sediment grain size, organic content, pH and salinity. We
   hypothesize that the distribution of modern salt-marsh foraminifera is
   primarily controlled by elevation above LLD.
   Location Knysna and Keiskamma estuaries along the southern coastline of
   South Africa.
   Methods Salt-marsh surface sediment samples (n = 97) were collected
   along eight intertidal transects with corresponding environmental data
   (pH, salinity, organic content, sand, silt, clay and elevation).
   Multivariate ordination analysis (partial redundancy analysis; pRDA) was
   used to investigate the relationship between living foraminiferal
   assemblages and environmental controls, after accounting for spatial
   variability in community composition.
   Results The pRDA suggests that species composition varied spatially
   within estuaries, but was strongly influenced by elevation at Keiskamma
   (r = 0.63) and Knysna (r = -0.75). At Keiskamma, the main gradient in
   composition was also influenced by salinity (r = -0.63), in an equal and
   opposite manner to elevation. Composition at Keiskamma was influenced to
   a much lesser extent by sediment organic content (r = 0.20) and the clay
   fraction (r = -0.13). At Knysna, pH (r = 0.455) was a secondary
   determinant of composition, and sediment characteristics covaried with
   elevation.
   Main conclusion Elevation was found to be a key environmental variable
   controlling the distribution of salt-marsh foraminifera at both
   estuaries, thereby validating the use of foraminifera as sea-level
   indicators. Certain species were particularly sensitive to elevation
   changes and could thus serve as useful indicators of past sea-level
   change. This is an important first step towards the development of
   high-resolution sea-level reconstructions for the South African

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{505-518}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{AimMultiple agents of change increasingly impact functioning of forest
   ecosystems, for which management plans often ignore how local
   disturbances and habitat fragmentation jointly operate on ecological
   resilience at different scales. We examined sensitivity of functional
   response diversity (FD) to variation in species diversity to predict
   ecological resilience to future disturbances across tree communities and
   evaluated the role of landscape connectivity in maintaining ecological
   resilience at the landscape scale.
   LocationCentre-du-Quebec, Quebec, Canada.
   MethodsWe inventoried private forests and calculated FD and
   community-weighted means to determine the extent to which forest-use
   intensity affects ecological resilience. Subsequently, we constructed a
   regional map of FD, from which a spatial network was extracted. To
   assess potential impacts of fragmentation in maintaining FD at the
   landscape scale, we examined how the functional connectivity of the
   landscape, measured by the probability of connectivity (PC), varied
   across a range of maximum seed dispersal distances. Lastly, we evaluated
   the importance of individual forest fragments in maintaining landscape
   FD by measuring the connectivity fractions of PC.
   ResultsAcross tree communities, ecological resilience was low as FD
   increased sharply with species diversity. Forests with high FD were
   dominated by species with trait values associated with greater
   resilience to future anthropogenic disturbances rather than to future
   climate change. FD was maintained across the landscape by forest
   fragments acting as intermediate stepping stones in the transfer of
   seeds.
   Main conclusionsWe employed a novel approach based on spatial networks
   to extend the functional diversity concept from the local to the
   landscape scale. Our results suggest that seed dispersal over
   sufficiently large distances can maintain ecological resilience in
   fragmented landscapes and buffer changes in local-scale FD. Otherwise,
   FD is maintained by local processes, meaning that ecological resilience
   of isolated forest fragments depends strongly on land use type and

Abstract = {{The bacterial communities inhabiting arthropods are generally dominated
   by a few endosymbionts that play an important role in the ecology of
   their hosts. Rather than comparing bacterial species richness across
   samples, ecological studies on arthropod endosymbionts often seek to
   identify the main bacterial strains associated with each specimen
   studied. The filtering out of contaminants from the results and the
   accurate taxonomic assignment of sequences are therefore crucial in
   arthropod microbiome studies. We aimed here to validate an Illumina 16S
   rRNA gene sequencing protocol and analytical pipeline for investigating
   endosymbiotic bacteria associated with aphids. Using replicate DNA
   samples from 12 species (Aphididae: Lachninae, Cinara) and several
   controls, we removed individual sequences not meeting a minimum
   threshold number of reads in each sample and carried out taxonomic
   assignment for the remaining sequences. With this approach, we show that
   (i) contaminants accounted for a negligible proportion of the bacteria
   identified in our samples; (ii) the taxonomic composition of our samples
   and the relative abundance of reads assigned to a taxon were very
   similar across PCR and DNA replicates for each aphid sample; in
   particular, bacterial DNA concentration had no impact on the results.
   Furthermore, by analysing the distribution of unique sequences across
   samples rather than aggregating them into operational taxonomic units
   (OTUs), we gained insight into the specificity of endosymbionts for
   their hosts. Our results confirm that Serratia symbiotica is often
   present in Cinara species, in addition to the primary symbiont, Buchnera
   aphidicola. Furthermore, our findings reveal new symbiotic associations
   with Erwinia- and Sodalis-related bacteria. We conclude with suggestions
   for generating and analysing 16S rRNA gene sequences for
   arthropod-endosymbiont studies.}},

   currently limiting rural development (the area's low ecological
   stability, frequent floods, ever greater soil erosion, etc.) and also
   describe measures which could protect the area against natural disasters
   (e.g. ongoing water erosion, silt accumulating and choking streams and
   water expanses). The paper introduces methodical procedures that enable
   a functional organization of the area to be designed (calculating

Abstract = {{Habitat structural complexity is a key factor shaping marine
   communities. However, accurate methods for quantifying structural
   complexity underwater are currently lacking. Loss of structural
   complexity is linked to ecosystem declines in biodiversity and
   resilience. We developed new methods using underwater stereo-imagery
   spanning 4years (2010-2013) to reconstruct 3D models of coral reef areas
   and quantified both structural complexity at two spatial resolutions
   (2.5 and 25cm) and benthic community composition to characterize changes
   after an unprecedented thermal anomaly on the west coast of Australia in
   2011. Structural complexity increased at both resolutions in quadrats
   (4m(2)) that bleached, but not those that did not bleach. Changes in
   complexity were driven by species-specific responses to warming,
   highlighting the importance of identifying small-scale dynamics to
   disentangle ecological responses to disturbance. We demonstrate an
   effective, repeatable method for quantifying the relationship among
   community composition, structural complexity and ocean warming,
   improving predictions of the response of marine ecosystems to

Title = {{A multi-scale looping approach to predict spatially dynamic patterns of

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{92-104}},

Abstract = {{Land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) change is one of the main drivers of global
   biodiversity change. However, the lack of detailed data on species'
   local distributions is frequently a major constraint to identify
   effective indicators of impact and to prescribe effective conservation
   and management measures. Here we aim to describe and demonstrate the
   applicability of a novel looping approach to predict spatially dynamic
   ecological responses to LU/LC changes. The methodology integrates
   statistical downscaling, multi-model inference, stochastic-dynamic
   modelling and simulations, and spatial projections under a common and
   interactive framework. We illustrate the approach with a study of
   passerine foraging groups and their potential indicator role under LU/LC
   change scenarios. Based on the coarse occurrence data from published
   atlases, this approach allowed transposing species richness to fine
   resolutions in order to assess regional ecological integrity by up
   scaling the local responses of those indicators again at the landscape
   level. Overall, our proposed framework was able to provide realistic
   patterns of passerine foraging responses to LU/LC changes, highlighting
   the usefulness of existing databases for model-based research in
   addressing complex emergent problems across scales. Comparative analysis
   between simulations and independent field data showed a promising model
   performance, with consistent projections of the local passerine
   functional composition for a significant number of point-counts tested.
   Our approach represents a contribution for more universal applications
   in the scope of conservation and landscape planning, especially when
   fine resolution data is difficult to obtain due to resources
   constraints. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental change is expected to shift the geographic range of
   species and communities. To estimate the consequences of these shifts
   for the functioning and stability of ecosystems, reliable predictions of
   alterations in species distributions are needed. Projections with
   correlative species distribution models, which correlate species'
   distributions to the abiotic environment, have become a standard
   approach. Criticism of this approach centres around the omission of
   relevant biotic feedbacks and triggered the search for alternatives. A
   new generation of mechanistic process-based species distribution models
   aims at implementing formulations of relevant biotic processes to cover
   species' life histories, physiology, dispersal abilities, evolution, and
   both intra- and interspecific interactions. Although this step towards
   more structural realism is considered important, it remains unclear
   whether the resulting projections are more reliable. Structural realism
   has the advantage that geographic range shifting emerges from the
   interplay of relevant abiotic and biotic processes. Having implemented
   the relevant response mechanisms, structural realistic models should
   better tackle the challenge of generating projections of species
   responses to (non-analogous) environmental change. However, reliable
   projections of future species ranges demand ecological information that
   is currently only available for few species. In this opinion paper, we
   discuss how the discrepancy between demand for structural realism on the
   one hand and the related knowledge gaps on the other hand affects the
   reliability of mechanistic species distribution models. We argue that
   omission of relevant processes potentially impairs projection accuracy
   (proximity of the mean outcome to the true value), particularly if
   species range shifts emerge from species and community dynamics. Yet,
   insufficient knowledge that limits model specification and
   parameterization, as well as process complexity, increases projection
   uncertainty (variance in the outcome of simulated model projections).
   The accuracy-uncertainty-relation reflects current limits to delivering
   reliable projections of range shifts. We propose a protocol to improve
   and communicate projection reliability. The protocol combines modelling
   and empirical research to efficiently fill critical knowledge gaps that
   currently limit the reliability of species and community projections.

Title = {{Implications of mechanistic modeling of drought effects on growth and
   competition in forest landscape models}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The incidence of drought is expected to increase worldwide as a factor
   structuring forested landscapes. Ecophysiological mechanisms are being
   added to Forest Landscape Models (FLMs) to increase their robustness to
   the novel environmental conditions of the future (including drought),
   but their behavior has not been evaluated for mixed temperate forests.
   We evaluated such an approach by assessing the ability of physiological
   mechanisms to predict susceptibility to tree mortality as a function of
   drought in the upper Midwest (USA) through controlled site-level drought
   simulation experiments using the PnET-Succession extension of the
   LANDIS-II FLM. We also conducted a landscape-level experiment to study
   landscape response to drought treatments in the presence of the spatial
   processes of seed dispersal and stand-replacing disturbance. At the site
   level we found that net photosynthesis and carbon reserves showed a
   clear negative response to both the length of drought and the
   alternating pulses of normal precipitation and drought events, with
   soils holding more water moderating this response. The effect of the
   drought treatments varied somewhat depending on the assemblage of
   competitors and their specific life-history traits such as ability to
   compete for light, maximum photosynthetic capacity and water use
   efficiency. A large diversity of assemblages were simulated at the
   landscape level, and species abundance generally sorted by
   photosynthetic capacity (foliar nitrogen) and life form (deciduous vs.
   evergreen), with faster growing species and deciduous species suffering
   less decline because of drought. Soil type also had an impact on total
   productivity (biomass), with soils having higher available water being
   more productive through time. We conclude that (1) the mechanistic,
   first principles approach is advantageous for global change research
   because the combination of life-history traits of competitors interact
   to cause a site-specific dynamic response to fundamental drivers (e.g.,
   precipitation, temperature), and these site-level responses interact
   spatially to create landscape responses that are complex and difficult
   to project with less mechanistic approaches, and (2) published findings
   that increasing drought length (rather than severity) increases tree
   mortality in the upper Midwest are clearly consistent with a mechanism
   of acute photosynthetic depression resulting in increased likelihood of
   carbon starvation as droughts lengthen.}},

Abstract = {{Fresh water biodiversity is an increasing concern due to growing human
   impact. Herein, we report a long-term survey (ca. 90 years) of
   sedimentary diatoms and the modern flora from surface sediments and
   their biodiversity changes along a eutrophication gradient. Study was
   carried out in one of the most important water supply reservoirs
   (Guarapiranga Reservoir) of Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region, Brazil.
   Results are based on 75 core subsamples (subfossil assemblages from
   core) previously dated by Pb-210 and 14 samples from surface sediments
   (modern assemblages). Overall, 84 taxa were reported, belonging to 30
   genera, 71 species and eight non-typical varieties, besides five
   probable new taxa. Results expanded two new additions for the Brazilian
   diatom flora (Chamaepinnularia submuscicula and Stauroneis acidoclinata)
   and 30 infrageneric taxa for the state of Sao Paulo. 47.6\% of total
   taxa inventoried were accounted exclusively for the subfossil
   assemblages indicating a significant biodiversity change over time.
   Access to past oligotrophic conditions and to contemporary mesotrophic
   regions of the Guarapiranga Reservoir accounted for these new additions
   representing 25\% of the total diatom flora. Decline in the total
   species number along the trophic state gradient occurred for subfossil
   and modern assemblages. This pattern was even clearer when considering
   the changes in species richness over time. Eunotia with 21 taxa was the
   far most represented genera particularly in the oligotrophic phase.
   During the transitional period (1947-1974), richness gradually declined.
   With the onset (in the 1970s) and the major eutrophication period (since
   ca. 1990) occurred a drastic reduction in richness and the replacement
   of oligotrophic to eutrophic species. Human management also caused
   abrupt changes in richness. Marked decline occurred (1933) assotiated
   with hydrological impacts (water discharge increase) with the initial
   use of the reservoir as a public water supply. Unlike, sudden increase
   occurred probably associated with the application of algaecide to
   control cyanobacterial blooms. Present findings highlight the need for
   surveying the diatom assemblages in protected environments or in less
   degraded conditions for biodiversity assessment. Furthermore, reinforce
   the use of paleolimnological approach as in many cases the only tool to
   assess biodiversity changes encompassing time scales relevant to
   human-induced degradation and pre-anthropogenic impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Scientists and resource managers often use methods and tools that assume
   ecosystem components respond linearly to environmental drivers and human
   stressors. However, a growing body of literature demonstrates that many
   relationships are non-linear, where small changes in a driver prompt a
   disproportionately large ecological response. We aim to provide a
   comprehensive assessment of the relationships between drivers and
   ecosystem components to identify where and when non-linearities are
   likely to occur. We focused our analyses on one of the best-studied
   marine systems, pelagic ecosystems, which allowed us to apply robust
   statistical techniques on a large pool of previously published studies.
   In this synthesis, we (1) conduct a wide literature review on single
   driver-response relationships in pelagic systems, (2) use statistical
   models to identify the degree of non-linearity in these relationships,
   and (3) assess whether general patterns exist in the strengths and
   shapes of non-linear relationships across drivers. Overall we found that
   non-linearities are common in pelagic ecosystems, comprising at least
   52\% of all driver-response relationships. This is likely an
   underestimate, as papers with higher quality data and analytical
   approaches reported non-linear relationships at a higher frequency (on
   average 11\% more). Consequently, in the absence of evidence for a
   linear relationship, it is safer to assume a relationship is non-linear.
   Strong non-linearities can lead to greater ecological and socioeconomic
   consequences if they are unknown (and/or unanticipated), but if known
   they may provide clear thresholds to inform management targets. In
   pelagic systems, strongly non-linear relationships are often driven by
   climate and trophodynamic variables but are also associated with local
   stressors, such as overfishing and pollution, that can be more easily
   controlled by managers. Even when marine resource managers cannot
   influence ecosystem change, they can use information about threshold
   responses to guide how other stressors are managed and to adapt to new
   ocean conditions. As methods to detect and reduce uncertainty around
   threshold values improve, managers will be able to better understand and
   account for ubiquitous non-linear relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Municipalities are turning to ecological restoration of urban forests as
   a measure to improve air quality, ameliorate urban heat island effects,
   improve storm water infiltration, and provide other social and
   ecological benefits. However, community dynamics following urban forest
   restoration treatments are poorly documented. This study examines the
   long-term effects of ecological restoration undertaken in New York City,
   New York, USA, to restore native forest in urban park natural areas
   invaded by woody non-native plants that are regional problems. In 2009
   and 2010, we sampled vegetation in 30 invaded sites in three large
   public parks that were restored 1988-1993, and 30 sites in three large
   parks that were similarly invaded but had not been restored. Data from
   these matched plots reveal that the restoration treatment achieved its
   central goals. After 15-20 years, invasive species removal followed by
   native tree planting resulted in persistent structural and compositional
   shifts, significantly lower invasive species abundance, a more complex
   forest structure, and greater native tree recruitment. Together, these
   findings indicate that successional trajectories of vegetation dynamics
   have diverged between restored forests and invaded forests that were not
   restored. In addition, the data suggest that future composition of these
   urban forest patches will be novel assemblages. Restored and untreated
   sites shared a suite of shade-intolerant, quickly-growing tree species
   that colonize disturbed sites, indicating that restoration treatments
   created sites hospitable for germination and growth of species adapted
   to high light conditions and disturbed soils. These findings yield an
   urban perspective on the use of succession theory in ecological
   restoration. Models of ecological restoration developed in more pristine
   environments must be modified for use in cities. By anticipating both
   urban disturbances and ecological succession, management of urban forest
   patches can be adjusted to better predict and direct long-term outcomes.
   An urban approach to ecological restoration must use realistic, flexible
   targets to preserve and enhance urban biodiversity for both short-term
   benefits and long-term sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies show that epigenetic variation in the form of DNA
   methylation may serve as a substrate for selection. Theory suggests that
   heritable epigenetic marks that increase fitness should increase in
   frequency in a population, and these changes may result in novel
   morphology, behaviour, or physiology, and ultimately reproductive
   isolation. Therefore, epigenetic variation might provide the first
   substrate for selection during the course of evolutionary divergence.
   This hypothesis predicts that populations in the earliest stages of
   divergence will differentiate in their methylome prior to any genetic
   differentiation. While several studies have investigated natural
   epigenetic variation, empirical studies that test predictions about its
   role in speciation are surprisingly scarce. Here, we investigate DNA
   methylation variation using an isoschizomeric digest method,
   Methyl-Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism, across multiple stages of
   evolutionary divergence in natural populations of North American stream
   fishes. We show that epigenetic differentiation between methylomes is
   greater than genetic divergence among closely related populations across
   two river drainages. Additionally, we demonstrate that epigenetic
   divergence is a stronger predictor of the strength of behavioural
   reproductive isolation and suggest that changes in the methylome could
   influence the evolution of reproductive isolation between species. Our
   findings suggest a role for epigenetics not only in the initiation of
   divergence, but also in the maintenance of species boundaries over
   greater evolutionary timescales.}},

Abstract = {{Immigration and local recruitment play a central role in determining the
   growth rate of breeding populations. Unraveling these processes in newly
   established populations is of great importance to increase our
   understanding of how species change their distributions in response to
   global change. We studied the largest colony of glossy ibis (Plegadis
   falcinellus) in Western Europe (established in 1996 in Donana, SW-Spain)
   by using capture-recapture methods, count estimates, and projection
   matrix modeling to: (1) test the effect of resource availability and
   competition on local recruitment dynamics, (2) investigate the
   contribution of local recruitment vs. immigration on population growth,
   and (3) assess the role of this population in source/sink dynamics. We
   found different dynamics before and after the establishment of satellite
   colonies in Donana in 2004. Between 1996 and 2003, the population
   increased rapidly, fueled by immigrants (approximate to 58 breeding
   females/yr). Between 2003 and 2007, however, both colony size increase
   and immigration were negligible. Immigration played a major role in
   colony growth, but simultaneously this colony was a source population
   driving expansion of the species range as suggested by (1) absolute and
   relative estimates of the observed growth rate relative to that
   predicted by self-recruitment, and (2) numerous observations of
   Donana-born individuals breeding elsewhere. Local recruitment, which was
   particularly high for first-year individuals (probability >0.8 for the
   early study years), was not directly related to resource availability or
   previous-year breeding success. Local recruitment decreased rapidly at a
   threshold population size, however, when other satellite colonies became
   established at Donana. Our study suggests that even when recruitment at
   an early age and high productivity are observed, immigration can still
   play a pivotal role in promoting the fast growth of new populations at
   the edge of a species range, at least until density-dependent effects
   arise. This process can be so fast that within a few years a new
   population can itself become a source population, further driving range
   expansion of the species.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2009, a cetacean presence and distribution long-term monitoring
   study has been ongoing in the Pelagos Sanctuary, a pelagic marine
   protected area located in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. One of the
   objectives of this study is to assess trends in cetacean presence and
   distribution to achieve good environmental status (GES) of pelagic
   marine waters. We assessed the density variability of the fin whale
   (Balaenoptera physalus) in the Pelagos Sanctuary. We used data collected
   during summer months (Jun-Sep) from 2009 to 2013, along 2 fixed
   transects crossing the Pelagos Sanctuary, using ferries as platforms of
   opportunity. We compared 2 un-corrected indexes: the linear encounter
   rate and density index, computed applying distance sampling methodology
   to select the most precise method. We also evaluated the effect of
   environmental covariates (e.g., platform height, Beaufort sea state,
   wind speed and direction, cloud cover and rain, longitude, latitude) on
   abundance and density estimation. Finally, we defined an unbiased index
   and used it to analyze the temporal and spatial variability of fin whale
   density in the Pelagos Sanctuary. Fin whale density along the 2
   transects varied on a yearly basis, with a peak in 2012 and 2013.
   Variability also occurred on a monthly basis, with a peak during the
   first half of the season. A longitudinal and a depth gradient were also
   evident, confirming differences in species displacement in the area.
   These results are consistent with previous studies, and update current
   knowledge of species presence in the area. The protocol tested in this
   work can be easily applied to the other cetacean species inhabiting the
   Pelagos Sanctuary providing a novel and cost-effective method to assess
   long-term trends in cetacean distribution and detect incipient changes
   in species density. (C) 2015 The Authors. Journal of Wildlife Management

Abstract = {{1. Camera recording and video analysis have emerged as a successful
   non-invasive method for collecting a wide range of biological data on
   many different taxa of animals. However, camera monitoring has rarely
   been applied to long-term surveillance of cavity or box-nesting species
   and ordinary off-the-shelf cameras are employed.
   2. We present methodology and data on the effectiveness of nest box
   monitoring using a camera system embedded in four smart nest boxes'
   (SNBoxes). We applied the SNBoxes to eight Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius
   funereus) nests in the Czech Republic during a 5-month period in 2014.
   Each SNBox consisted of a pair of cameras with infrared lighting, an
   event detector, a radiofrequency identification reader, auxiliary
   sensors and a 60 Ah 12V battery to power the whole system. All devices
   used were centrally managed by an embedded computer with specifically
   developed software.
   3. Using four SNBoxes, we observed owl nesting continually during the
   incubation, nestling and fledgling phases, in total 309days, resulting
   in 3382 owl video events. Batteries were changed every 65days. A memory
   of 4GB was found sufficient to store monthly data. We identified 12
   types of male and female parental activities and their timing, the diet
   composition and frequency of prey delivery, the manner of prey storage,
   the light intensity at the time of each parental activity, the
   temperature inside the clutch and outside the box and the duration of
   nestling period of each young. We also produced a video on owl nesting
   for the general public.
   4. The SNBox and related methodology show enormous potential as a
   non-invasive tool for monitoring animals using boxes or natural
   cavities. The main advantage of the SNBox is the possibility to study
   both nocturnal and diurnal animal species and great flexibility in use
   of the software and hardware for different tasks. As a result, the SNBox
   provides an opportunity for novel insights into the breeding, roosting,
   hibernating, and food storage activities of a wide range of
   cavity-living birds, mammals and reptiles.}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding and management of pathways of alien species
   introductions has improved significantly in the past few years. However,
   little attention has been paid in most parts of the world to the risks
   posed by the intentional introduction of alien terrestrial invertebrates
   which are not intended for use in biological control. We review the
   species and pathways involved in this intentional trade, and discuss key
   factors that mediate different aspects of risk. A total of 20 different
   intentions for the introduction of terrestrial invertebrates were
   identified. Uses and trade patterns have changed over time and further
   changes are likely in the future. In particular, invertebrates used in
   the pet trade, and as human food and animal feed are likely to increase
   in relevance. We assess priorities for future research and regulation
   based on the perceived ``risk{''} of the uses including propagule
   pressure, security of captivity and ease of regulation. Regarding risk
   assessment, we examine three options: (a) using an existing generic
   protocol developed for a broad range of taxa; (b) developing a new
   protocol, possibly by adapting a protocol developed for other taxa; and
   (c) adopting the approach applied for biological control, i.e.
   structured experiments and observations. This review highlights the
   diversity of uses and associated threats of intentional terrestrial
   invertebrate introductions. It provides recommendations on how to tackle
   and prevent related issues and can therefore serve as a guideline for
   future work. We argue that the most suitable option for risk assessment
   might depend on the type or organism and the level of knowledge of the
   organism, as well as the intended use.}},

Abstract = {{AimAvian communities in human-modified landscapes exhibit varying
   patterns of local colonization and extinction rates, determinants of
   species occurrence. Our objective was to model these processes to
   identify habitat features that might enable movements and account for
   occupancy patterns in habitat matrices between the Guanica and Susua
   forest reserves. This knowledge is central to conservation design,
   particularly in ever changing insular landscapes.
   LocationSouth-western Puerto Rico.
   MethodsWe used a multiseason occupancy modelling approach to quantify
   seasonal estimates of occupancy, and colonization and extinction rates
   of seven resident avian species surveyed over five seasons from January
   2010 to June 2011. We modelled parameters by matrix type, expressions of
   survey station isolation, quality, amount of forest cover and context
   (embedded in forest patch).
   ResultsSeasonal occupancy remained stable throughout the study for all
   species, consistent with seasonally constant colonization and extinction
   probabilities. Occupancy was mediated by matrix type, higher in reserves
   and forested matrix than in the urban and agricultural matrices. This
   pattern is in accord with the forest affinities of all but an
   open-habitat specialist. Puerto Rican Spindalis (Spindalis
   portoricensis) exhibited high occupancy in the urban matrix,
   highlighting the adaptability of some insular species to novel
   environments. Highest colonization rates occurred when perching
   structures were at 500m. Survey stations with at least three fruiting
   tree species and 61\% forest cover exhibited lowest seasonal extinction
   rates.
   Main conclusionsOur work identified habitat features that influenced
   seasonal probabilities of colonization and extinction in a
   human-modified landscape. Conservation design decisions are better
   informed with increased knowledge about interpatch distances to improve
   matrix permeability, and habitat features that increase persistence or
   continued use of habitat stepping stones. A focus on dynamic processes
   is valuable because conservation actions directly influence colonization
   and extinction rates, and thus, a quantitative means to gauge their
   benefit.}},

Journal = {{THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{13-23}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In population and evolutionary biology, hypotheses about
   micro-evolutionary and macro-evolutionary processes are commonly tested
   by comparing the shape indices of empirical evolutionary trees with
   those predicted by neutral models. A key ingredient in this approach is
   the ability to compute and quantify distributions of various tree shape
   indices under random models of interest. As a step to meet this
   challenge, in this paper we investigate the joint distribution of
   cherries and pitchforks (that is, subtrees with two and three leaves)
   under two widely used null models: the Yule-Harding-Kingman (YHK) model
   and the proportional to distinguishable arrangements (PDA) model. Based
   on two novel recursive formulae, we propose a dynamic approach to
   numerically compute the exact joint distribution (and hence the marginal
   distributions) for trees of any size. We also obtained insights into the
   statistical properties of trees generated under these two models,
   including a constant correlation between the cherry and the pitchfork
   distributions under the YHK model, and the log-concavity and unimodality
   of the cherry distributions under both models. In addition, we show that
   there exists a unique change point for the cherry distributions between
   these two models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{World governments have committed to increase the global protected areas
   coverage by 2020, but the effectiveness of this commitment for
   protecting biodiversity depends on where new protected areas are
   located. Threshold- and complementarity-based approaches have been
   independently used to identify important sites for biodiversity. We
   brought together these approaches by performing a complementarity-based
   analysis of irreplaceability in important bird and biodiversity areas
   (IBAs), which are sites identified using a threshold-based approach. We
   determined whether irreplaceability values are higher inside than
   outside IBAs and whether any observed difference depends on known
   characteristics of the IBAs. We focused on 3 regions with comprehensive
   IBA inventories and bird distribution atlases: Australia, southern
   Africa, and Europe. Irreplaceability values were significantly higher
   inside than outside IBAs, although differences were much smaller in
   Europe than elsewhere. Higher irreplaceability values in IBAs were
   associated with the presence and number of restricted-range species;
   number of criteria under which the site was identified; and mean
   geographic range size of the species for which the site was identified
   (trigger species). In addition, IBAs were characterized by higher
   irreplaceability values when using proportional species representation
   targets, rather than fixed targets. There were broadly comparable
   results when measuring irreplaceability for trigger species and when
   considering all bird species, which indicates a good surrogacy effect of
   the former. Recently, the International Union for Conservation of Nature
   has convened a consultation to consolidate global standards for the
   identification of key biodiversity areas (KBAs), building from existing
   approaches such as IBAs. Our results informed this consultation, and in
   particular a proposed irreplaceability criterion that will allow the new
   KBA standard to draw on the strengths of both threshold- and
   complementarity-based approaches.
   Cuantificacion del Caracter Relativamente Irreemplazable de las areas
   Importantes para la Conservacion de Aves Los gobiernos del mundo se han
   comprometido a incrementar la cobertura de las areas protegidas para el
   ano 2020, pero la efectividad de este compromiso con la proteccion de la
   biodiversidad depende de la ubicacion de las nuevas areas protegidas.
   Las estrategias basadas en umbrales y en la complementareidad se han
   utilizado independientemente para identificar sitios importantes para la
   biodiversidad. Juntamos estas estrategias al realizar un analisis basado
   en la complementareidad del caracter irremplazable de las areas
   importantes para la conservacion de aves (AICA), que son sitios
   identificados con el uso de una estrategia basada en umbrales.
   Determinamos si los valores de irreemplazabilidad son mas altos dentro
   que fuera de una AICA y si alguna diferencia observada depende de las
   caracteristicas conocidas del area. Nos enfocamos en tres regiones con
   inventarios completos de AICA y en atlas de distribucion de aves:
   Australia, el sur de africa y Europa. Los valores de irreemplazabilidad
   fueron significativamente mas altos dentro de las AICA que fuera, aunque
   las diferencias fueron mucho menores en Europa que en otro lado. Los
   valores mas altos de irreemplazabilidad en las AICA estuvieron asociados
   con la presencia y el numero de especies con extension restringida; el
   numero de criterios bajo los que se identifico el sitio; y el tamano
   promedio de la extension geografica de las especies para las cuales se
   identifico el sitio (especies de activacion). Ademas, las AICA se
   caracterizaron por valores de irreemplazabilidad mas altos cuando se
   usaron objetivos de representacion proporcional de especies en lugar de
   objetivos fijos. Hubo resultados comparables de manera general cuando se
   midio la irreemplazabilidad de las especies de activacion y cuando se
   considero a todas las especies de aves, lo que indica un buen efecto de
   sustitucion de las anteriores. La Union Internacional para la
   Conservacion de la Naturaleza convoco recientemente a una consulta para
   consolidar los estandares globales para la identificacion de areas clave
   de biodiversidad (ACB), a partir de las estrategias existentes como las
   AICA. Nuestros resultados brindaron informacion a esta consulta y en
   particular a la propuesta de un criterio de irreemplazabilidad que
   permitira al nuevo estandar de las ACB recurrir a las fortalezas de las
   estrategias basadas en umbrales y de las basadas en la
   complementareidad.

Abstract = {{Climate change is shifting species' distribution and phenology.
   Ecological traits, such as mobility or reproductive mode, explain
   variation in observed rates of shift for some taxa. However, estimates
   of relationships between traits and climate responses could be
   influenced by how responses are measured. We compiled a global data set
   of 651 published marine species' responses to climate change, from 47
   papers on distribution shifts and 32 papers on phenology change. We
   assessed the relative importance of two classes of predictors of the
   rate of change, ecological traits of the responding taxa and
   methodological approaches for quantifying biological responses.
   Methodological differences explained 22\% of the variation in range
   shifts, more than the 7.8\% of the variation explained by ecological
   traits. For phenology change, methodological approaches accounted for
   4\% of the variation in measurements, whereas 8\% of the variation was
   explained by ecological traits. Our ability to predict responses from
   traits was hindered by poor representation of species from the tropics,
   where temperature isotherms are moving most rapidly. Thus, the mean rate
   of distribution change may be underestimated by this and other global
   syntheses. Our analyses indicate that methodological approaches should
   be explicitly considered when designing, analysing and comparing results
   among studies. To improve climate impact studies, we recommend that (1)
   reanalyses of existing time series state how the existing data sets may
   limit the inferences about possible climate responses; (2) qualitative
   comparisons of species' responses across different studies be limited to
   studies with similar methodological approaches; (3) meta-analyses of
   climate responses include methodological attributes as covariates; and
   (4) that new time series be designed to include the detection of early
   warnings of change or ecologically relevant change. Greater
   consideration of methodological attributes will improve the accuracy of
   analyses that seek to quantify the role of climate change in species'
   distribution and phenology changes.}},

Abstract = {{The embryonic development of the squid Loligo vulgaris was observed from
   183 egg masses collected from special devices deployed throughout
   Cabrera National Park (Baleares Islands, western Mediterranean Sea).
   Sequence alignment analysis of the cytochrome oxidase I gene revealed
   that all embryos belonged to L.vulgaris. In total, 549 egg capsules were
   examined. Viable egg capsules (n=420) were classified into one of five
   maturation stages according to the primary external features. The length
   of the viable egg capsules varied between 40 and 170mm, and increased
   with embryonic development. The non-viable capsules (n=129) were
   categorized into four groups: I (Ginger root), non-viable II and III,
   and empty egg capsule (IV). The percentage of non-viable capsules (i.e.
   grades I, II and III) was 92.25\%. Empty capsules accounted for 7.75\%
   of the total non-viable egg capsules. Embryonic development was
   classified into a second scale of eight stages. Egg capsule stage and
   embryonic stage were significantly related (n=420; p<0.001),
   facilitating the determination of the embryo developmental phase based
   on the outward appearance of the egg capsules. The embryo development
   stage based on the external features of the egg capsules might
   constitute an innovative tool for in situ embryological data collection.
   This new method is neither time consuming nor invasive, and could be
   helpful in fishing cruises, for scuba diving visual census in natural
   habitats and for laboratory culture. Slight variability in the
   developmental embryonic stages within egg capsules from the same egg
   mass was identified. The origin of this asynchrony is discussed.
   Chronological appearance of organs was similar to that of the six
   loliginid species previously examined. However, some developmental
   changes in the timing or rate of events (heterochronies) were observed:
   Hoyle's organ was formed earlier in L.vulgaris and the appearance of
   ventral chromatophores was slightly delayed (2days) compared with the
   other species considered.}},

Abstract = {{Robust models of wildlife population size, spatial distribution, and
   habitat relationships are needed to more effectively monitor endangered
   species and prioritize habitat conservation efforts. Remotely sensed
   data such as airborne laser altimetry (LiDAR) and digital color infrared
   (CIR) aerial photography combined with well-designed field studies can
   help fill these information voids. We used point count-based distance
   sampling survey data and LiDAR-fused CIR aerial photography to model
   density of the Golden-cheeked Warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia), an
   endangered songbird, on the 10000-ha Balcones Canyonlands National
   Wildlife Refuge (BCNWR). We developed a novel set of candidate models to
   explain Golden-cheeked Warbler detection probability and density using
   habitat covariates characterizing vegetation structure, composition, and
   complexity as well as habitat fragmentation, topography, and human
   infrastructure. We had the most model support for covariates calculated
   using focal means representing a 3.2ha territory size (100 m radius) vs.
   1.8 and 7.0 ha territory sizes. Detection probability decreased with
   canopy cover and increased with topographic roughness. Golden-cheeked
   Warbler density increased with canopy cover, was highest at a 7:3 ratio
   of Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) to broadleaf tree canopy cover, and
   decreased with global solar radiation. Predicted warbler densities using
   3 min point counts were similar to six estimates from independently
   collected warbler territory mapping on BCNWR with a mean difference of
   6\% and a Root Mean Squared Error of 1.88 males/40 ha. The total
   population size for BCNWR was estimated at 884 Golden-cheeked Warbler
   males (95\% CI 662, 1206) and predicted densities across the refuge
   ranged from 0.0 to 0.50 male warblers per ha. On the basis of observed
   habitat relationships, we defined high quality habitat as having at
   least 60\% canopy cover with Ashe juniper comprising 50-90\% of the
   canopy. We estimated 48\% of the area at BCNWR managed for
   Golden-cheeked Warblers was in high quality habitat conditions and
   identified patches within the lower habitat quality areas (14\% of
   warbler management areas) that had the greatest potential to become high
   quality habitat with management. Our approach combined robust wildlife
   surveys with highly scalable remotely sensed data to examine habitat
   relationships, estimate population size, and identify existing areas of
   high quality habitat. This method can be applied to other species of
   conservation interest and can be used with multiple years of remotely
   sensed data to assess changes in habitat at local to regional scales.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The koala is a widely distributed Australian marsupial with regional
   populations that are in rapid decline, are stable or have increased in
   size. This study examined whether it is possible to use expert
   elicitation to estimate abundance and trends of populations of this
   species. Diverse opinions exist about estimates of abundance and,
   consequently, the status of populations.
   Location Eastern and south-eastern Australia
   Methods Using a structured, four-step question format, a panel of 15
   experts estimated population sizes of koalas and changes in those sizes
   for bioregions within four states. They provided their lowest plausible
   estimate, highest plausible estimate, best estimate and their degree of
   confidence that the true values were contained within these upper and
   lower estimates. We derived estimates of the mean population size of
   koalas and associated uncertainties for each bioregion and state.
   Results On the basis of estimates of mean population sizes for each
   bioregion and state, we estimated that the total number of koalas for
   Australia is 329,000 (range 144,000-605,000) with an estimated average
   decline of 24\% over the past three generations and the next three
   generations. Estimated percentage of loss in Queensland, New South
   Wales, Victoria and South Australia was 53\%, 26\%, 14\% and 3\%,
   respectively.
   Main conclusions It was not necessary to achieve high levels of
   certainty or consensus among experts before making informed estimates. A
   quantitative, scientific method for deriving estimates of koala
   populations and trends was possible, in the absence of empirical data on
   abundances.}},

Abstract = {{Species selection resulting from trait-dependent speciation and
   extinction is increasingly recognized as an important mechanism of
   phenotypic macroevolution. However, the recent bloom in statistical
   methods quantifying this process faces a scarcity of dynamical theory
   for their interpretation, notably regarding the relative contributions
   of deterministic versus stochastic evolutionary forces. I use simple
   diffusion approximations of birth-death processes to investigate how the
   expected and random components of macroevolutionary change depend on
   phenotype-dependent speciation and extinction rates, as can be estimated
   empirically. I show that the species selection coefficient for a binary
   trait, and selection differential for a quantitative trait, depend not
   only on differences in net diversification rates (speciation minus
   extinction), but also on differences in species turnover rates
   (speciation plus extinction), especially in small clades. The randomness
   in speciation and extinction events also produces a species-level
   equivalent to random genetic drift, which is stronger for higher
   turnover rates. I then show how microevolutionary processes including
   mutation, organismic selection, and random genetic drift cause state
   transitions at the species level, allowing comparison of evolutionary
   forces across levels. A key parameter that would be needed to apply this
   theory is the distribution and rate of origination of new optimum
   phenotypes along a phylogeny.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of taxa dependent on young forests and shrublands in the
   northeastern United States are declining in response to habitat loss and
   fragmentation. In particular, the reduction in distribution and
   abundance of the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis;
   NECs) prompted consideration to list it as federally threatened or
   endangered. In response to those concerns, a range-wide conservation
   strategy for NECs has been developed that includes managing >20,000ha of
   thicket habitats. Although much is known about the habitat associations
   of NECs, there is no obvious approach for evaluating the suitability of
   sites managed for them. We developed a habitat suitability model that
   conservationists can use to monitor progress in generating and
   maintaining habitats for NECs. We relied on literature reviews, expert
   opinions, and field data to identify habitat features that can be
   measured and indexed and used in a simple model to rank patches of
   habitat on a scale of 0 (unsuitable) to 1 (high suitability). Important
   features included dense understory vegetation, summer forage, and the
   presence-absence of additional refuges (e.g., constructed brush piles).
   We used our model to rank 60 managed habitats and found general
   agreement with opinions of an expert panel. There are obvious advantages
   to using a habitat-suitability model during efforts to restore
   populations of NECs: it provides a consistent approach for monitoring
   management actions, can be used to identify site-specific limitations
   prior to releasing cottontails in vacant habitats, and can be used to
   track suitability over time and alert managers of potential habitat
   deficiencies. Our suitability model also can be modified to accommodate
   new information and changing conditions. (c) 2015 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluate the outcomes and consequences of a decade-long restoration
   project in a Hawaiian lowland wet forest as they relate to long-term
   management actions. Our initial study was designed both to promote
   native biodiversity and to develop knowledge that would enable land
   management agencies to restore invaded forests. Our premise of success
   followed the prevalent perception that short-term management, such as
   removal of invasive species, ideally translates into long-term and
   sustainable restoration. We were therefore disappointed and perhaps
   discouraged in our resultslittle recovery of native biodiversity despite
   ongoing and labor-intensive management. Not only did we fail to return
   the invaded forest to a native-dominated system but also our efforts
   lead to recruitment of new non-native species assemblages. The sobering
   truth of many restoration projects in Hawaii and elsewhere is that we
   can never completely walk away and consider the job finished, or we have
   to accept that some ecosystems cannot be returned to an all-native
   state. Essentially, costs of restoration may outweigh the
   accomplishment. This setback gave us an opportunity to reconsider and
   modify our initial approach. By starting over with a new direction using
   both native and non-invasive but non-native species, we have adopted a
   new philosophy of join them. In our revision, we changed the players in

   missing roles in the ecosystem. We link social interest in the new

Abstract = {{Spatial management of the highly dynamic pelagic realm, and the highly
   mobile species it supports, requires dynamic processes to be
   incorporated into reserve design. To achieve this, planners need
   information on how these processes vary across space and time, and how
   this variation relates to species of conservation interest. This study
   presents a new method of quantifying variability that captures both
   between- and within-year changes in variables of interest. We applied
   this method to remotely-sensed chlorophyll-a in the Coral Sea to find
   five distinct regimes of variation that serve as surrogates for
   assemblages of species of conservation interest. We performed a gap
   analysis to determine protection of the regimes both internationally and
   nationally within Australia's network of marine reserves in the Coral
   Sea. We also identified key areas for protection within each regime, in
   terms of chlorophyll-a variability and species associations, and
   examined their protection status. Depending on conservation objectives,
   reserve systems that span multiple national jurisdictions and a rezoning
   of Australian national waters might be necessary to meet protection
   requirements for the regimes and for key areas within them. The current
   suspension and review of the Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve
   management plans and the recent proclamation of New Caledonia's as yet
   unzoned Coral Sea Nature Park offer planners an opportunity to
   incorporate dynamic processes into conservation planning for the Coral

Abstract = {{Demand for woody biomass fuels is increasing amidst concerns about

   implications of increased harvesting for forest ecosystem functions and
   their benefits to society (ecosystem services). Using new methods for
   assessing ecosystem services based on long-term experimental research,
   post-harvest changes in ten potential benefits were assessed for ten
   first-order northern hardwood forest watersheds at three long-term
   experimental research sites in northeastern North America. As expected,
   we observed near-term tradeoffs between biomass provision and greenhouse
   gas regulation, as well as tradeoffs between intensive harvest and the
   capacity of the forest to remediate nutrient pollution. In both cases,
   service provision began to recover along with the regeneration of forest
   vegetation; in the case of pollution remediation, the service recovered
   to pre-harvest levels within 10 years. By contrast to these two
   services, biomass harvesting had relatively nominal and transient
   impacts on other ecosystem services. Our results are sensitive to
   empirical definitions of societal demand, including methods for scaling
   societal demand to ecosystem units, which are often poorly resolved.
   Reducing uncertainty around these parameters can improve confidence in

Abstract = {{Coral reefs support spectacularly productive and diverse communities in

   continues, however, on the degree to which reef biomass is supported by
   new water column production, benthic primary production, and recycled
   detrital carbon (C). We coupled compound-specific stable C isotope ratio
   (delta C-13) analyses with Bayesian mixing models to quantify C flow
   from primary producers to coral reef fishes across multiple feeding
   guilds and trophic positions in the Red Sea. Analyses of reef fishes
   with putative diets composed primarily of zooplankton (Amblyglyphidodon
   indicus), benthic macroalgae (Stegastes nigricans), reef-associated
   detritus (Ctenochaetus striatus), and coral tissue (Chaetodon
   trifascialis) confirmed that delta C-13 values of essential amino acids
   from all baseline C sources were both isotopically diagnostic and
   accurately recorded in consumer tissues. While all four source
   end-members contributed to the production of coral reef fishes in our
   study, a single-source end-member often dominated dietary C assimilation
   of a given species, even for highly mobile, generalist top predators.
   Microbially reworked detritus was an important secondary C source for
   most species. Seascape configuration played an important role in
   structuring resource utilization patterns. For instance, Lutjanus
   ehrenbergii showed a significant shift from a benthic macroalgal food
   web on shelf reefs (71 +/- A 13 \% of dietary C) to a
   phytoplankton-based food web (72 +/- A 11 \%) on oceanic reefs. Our work

Abstract = {{Climatic fluctuations during the Quaternary period governed the
   demography of species and contributed to population differentiation and
   ultimately speciation. Studies of these past processes have previously
   been hindered by a lack of means and genetic data to model changes in
   effective population size (N-e) through time. However, based on diploid
   genome sequences of high quality, the recently developed pairwise
   sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) can estimate trajectories of
   changes in N-e over considerable time periods. We applied this approach
   to resequencing data from nearly 200 genomes of four species and several
   populations of the Ficedula species complex of black-and-white
   flycatchers. N-e curves of Atlas, collared, pied and semicollared
   flycatcher converged 1-2million years ago (Ma) at an N-e of approximate
   to 200000, likely reflecting the time when all four species last shared
   a common ancestor. Subsequent separate N-e trajectories are consistent
   with lineage splitting and speciation. All species showed evidence of
   population growth up until 100-200thousand years ago (kya), followed by
   decline and then start of a new phase of population expansion. However,
   timing and amplitude of changes in N-e differed among species, and for
   pied flycatcher, the temporal dynamics of N-e differed between Spanish
   birds and central/northern European populations. This cautions against
   extrapolation of demographic inference between lineages and calls for
   adequate sampling to provide representative pictures of the coalescence
   process in different species or populations. We also empirically
   evaluate criteria for proper inference of demographic histories using
   PSMC and arrive at recommendations of using sequencing data with a mean
   genome coverage of 18X, a per-site filter of 10 reads and no more than
   25\% of missing data.}},

Abstract = {{Urban stormwater runoff is a critical source of degradation to stream
   ecosystems globally. Despite broad appreciation by stream ecologists of
   negative effects of stormwater runoff, stormwater management objectives
   still typically center on flood and pollution mitigation without an
   explicit focus on altered hydrology. Resulting management approaches are
   unlikely to protect the ecological structure and function of streams
   adequately. We present critical elements of stormwater management
   necessary for protecting stream ecosystems through 5 principles intended
   to be broadly applicable to all urban landscapes that drain to a
   receiving stream: 1) the ecosystems to be protected and a target
   ecological state should be explicitly identified; 2) the postdevelopment
   balance of evapotranspiration, stream flow, and infiltration should
   mimic the predevelopment balance, which typically requires keeping
   significant runoff volume from reaching the stream; 3) stormwater
   control measures (SCMs) should deliver flow regimes that mimic the
   predevelopment regime in quality and quantity; 4) SCMs should have
   capacity to store rain events for all storms that would not have
   produced widespread surface runoff in a predevelopment state, thereby
   avoiding increased frequency of disturbance to biota; and 5) SCMs should
   be applied to all impervious surfaces in the catchment of the target
   stream. These principles present a range of technical and social
   challenges. Existing infrastructural, institutional, or governance
   contexts often prevent application of the principles to the degree
   necessary to achieve effective protection or restoration, but
   significant potential exists for multiple co-benefits from SCM
   technologies (e.g., water supply and climate-change adaptation) that may
   remove barriers to implementation. Our set of ideal principles for
   stream protection is intended as a guide for innovators who seek to
   develop new approaches to stormwater management rather than accept
   seemingly insurmountable historical constraints, which guarantee future,
   ongoing degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Functional diversity (FD) has become a principal concept for revealing
   mechanisms driving community assembly and ecosystem function. Multiple
   assembly processes, including abiotic filtering, competition and
   multi-trophic relationships, operate simultaneously to structure FD. In
   water-limited plant communities, FD is likely to reflect trade-offs
   between drought resistance vs. disturbance resistance and competitive
   ability. We propose a mathematical mechanistic model for understanding
   the organization and function of water-limited plant communities. The
   approach captures the interplay between abiotic filtering, below- and
   above-ground competition and disturbance. We exploit this powerful model
   to uncover mechanisms underlying changes in functional diversity along
   stress gradients. Our approach links biomass production and FD to
   environmental conditions through plant resource capture ability.
   Functional groups are defined along a single trade-off axis according to
   investment in capturing light (shoot) vs. water (root). Species growth
   rate is determined dynamically by the species traits, water availability
   and grazing stress. We derive biomass production, functional diversity
   and composition along precipitation and grazing gradients. Model's
   results revealed several regimes structuring FD along the precipitation
   gradient: Struggle for water' at low precipitation, competition for
   water' at intermediate precipitation and competition for light' at high
   precipitation. We observed a shift in grazing effect on FD from negative
   at very low precipitation, to positive at higher precipitation. Unimodal
   FD-grazing intensity relationship was observed under high precipitation,
   while under low precipitation, FD decreased moderately with increasing
   grazing intensity.Synthesis. Our model showcases how fundamental
   tradeoffs in plant traits may drive functional diversity and ecosystem
   function along environmental gradients. It offers a mechanism through
   which novel understandings can be obtained regarding the interplay
   between water stress, below- and above-ground competition and
   disturbance intensity and history. We discuss further model testing
   possibilities as well as required empirical work.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding which factors and rules govern the process of assembly in
   communities constitutes one of the main challenges of plant community
   ecology. The presence of certain functional strategies along broad
   environmental gradients can help to understand the patterns observed in
   community assembly and the filtering mechanisms that take place. We used
   a trait-based approach, quantifying variations in aboveground (leaf and
   stem) and belowground (root) functional traits along environmental
   gradients in Mediterranean forest communities (south Spain). We proposed
   a new practical method to quantify the relative importance of species
   turnover (distinguishing between species occurrence and abundance)
   versus intraspecific variation, which allowed us to better understand
   the assemblage rules of these plant communities along environmental
   gradients. Our results showed that the functional structure of the
   studied plant communities was highly determined by soil environment.
   Results from our modelling approach based on maximum likelihood
   estimators showed a predominant influence of soil water storage on most
   of the community functional traits. We found that changes in community
   functional structure along environmental gradients were mainly promoted
   by species turnover rather than by intraspecific variability.
   Specifically, our new method of variance decomposition demonstrated that
   between-site trait variation was the result of changes in species
   occurrence rather than in the abundance of certain dominant species. In
   conclusion, this study showed that water availability promoted the
   predominance of specific trait values (both in above and belowground
   fractions) associated to a resource acquisition or conservation
   strategy. In addition, we provided evidence that changes on community
   functional structure along the environmental gradient were mainly
   promoted by a process of species replacement, which represent a crucial
   step towards a more general understanding of the relative importance of
   intraspecific versus interspecific trait variation in these woody

Abstract = {{The concept of tracing the ecologically-based life cycle impacts of
   agricultural and food industries (AFIs) has become a topic of interest
   worldwide due to their critical association with the climate change,
   water and land footprint, and food security. In this study, an in-depth
   analysis of ecological resource consumption, atmospheric emissions, land
   and water footprints of 54 agricultural and food industries in the U.S.
   were examined extensively. Initially, the supply-chain linked ecological
   life cycle assessment was performed with Ecologically-based Life Cycle
   Assessment (Eco-LCA) tool. Then, the results of life cycle inventory
   were used to assess the mid and end-point impacts by using the ReCiPe
   approach. Thirdly, ecological performance assessment was performed using
   well-known metrics, including loading and renewability ratios and
   eco-efficiency analysis. As a novel comprehensive approach, the
   integrated framework that consists of the Eco-LCA, ReCiPe and linear
   programming-based ecological performance assessment is of importance to
   have an overall understanding about the extent of impacts related to
   agricultural and food production activities across the U.S. Results
   indicated that grain farming, dairy food, and animal production-related
   sectors were found to have the greatest shares in both environmental and
   ecological impact categories as well as endpoint impacts on human
   health, ecosystem and resources. In terms of climate change, animal
   (except poultry) slaughtering, rendering, and processing (ASRP), cattle
   ranching and farming (CRF), fertilizer manufacturing (FM), grain farming
   (GF), fluid milk and butter manufacturing (FMBM) were found to be the
   top five dominant industries in climate change impacts accounting for
   about 60\% share of the total impact. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{186-194}},

Abstract = {{In this case study we document the effects of a transition to organic
   and low-input production methods on energy efficiency and greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions for a student educational farm in Kentucky, USA. This
   diverse farm system of 167 ha included crop and livestock enterprises:
   beef cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, chickens (broilers and layers), grains,
   hay and vegetables/fruit. The analysis compares the farm's material
   inputs, outputs and emissions across three periods: pre-transition
   (2007-2008), transition (2009-2011) and post-transition (2012-213). The
   changes implemented during the transition period included: increasing
   the amount of organically-managed cropland from 3\% to 25\% of the
   farm's land area; replacing an indoor-confinement pig enterprise with an
   outdoor rotational system; and eliminating grain from cattle rations to
   finish animals on pasture and hay. The implementation of these
   management practices resulted in relatively little change in total
   energy inputs and outputs, though somewhat lower levels of both were
   observed during the transition period. There was a steady decline in the
   use of non-renewable energy inputs during the study period and a
   subsequent decline in GHG emissions per unit area and per unit of energy
   output. The trends in energy and GHG emissions were explained largely by
   the smaller livestock herd sizes that were required to accommodate the
   new management practices and a corresponding increase in organic crop
   production proportional to the decrease in livestock production. The
   expansion of organic crop production resulted in a marked reduction in N
   fertilizer use and concomitant reduction in GHG emissions. A decrease in
   the use of fossil energy sources, including natural gas, electricity and
   gasoline, also contributed to the trends, though diesel consumption
   increased during the study period. This case study demonstrates the
   capacity to reduce the use of non-renewable resources and generation of
   GHG emissions with organic and low-input practices and highlights the
   interdependencies and interactions among enterprises within diversified
   farm systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, urban sprawl is one of important spatial problems in Poland,
   although to date it has mostly been recognised as an issue in suburban
   areas. This study aims to explain how the expansion of purpose-built
   second homes contributes to the creation of a sprawled settlement
   pattern in areas of high natural value, focusing on the example of Bory
   Tucholskie as a study area. Two research approaches are used: first, an
   inventory of second homes and archival aerial photographs are combined
   to perform a GIS analysis of the factors affecting the location of
   second homes and other new buildings within the past two decades;
   second, the results of a survey, interviews and the analysis of
   documents provide a deeper understanding of the quantitative results.
   The location of new second homes is conditioned by the presence of the
   forest, lakes, and their isolation from main villages. Unlike other new
   developments, second homes create a disorganised, discontinuous and
   increasingly dispersed spatial pattern in the vicinity of natural areas,
   which can be explained by the motives for the use of second homes, the
   practices of their acquisition and the planning regulations. Second
   homes are an integral part of the sprawl process that is occurring in
   Poland, which is generated by economic restructuring, increasing
   consumption, and lifestyle changes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Species composition and habitats are changing at unprecedented rates in
   the world's oceans, potentially causing entire food webs to shift to
   structurally and functionally different regimes. Despite the severity of
   these regime shifts, elucidating the precise nature of their underlying
   processes has remained difficult. We address this challenge with a new
   analytic approach to detect and assess the relative strength of
   different driving processes in food webs. Our study draws on complexity
   theory, and integrates the network-centric exponential random graph
   modelling (ERGM) framework developed within the social sciences with
   community ecology. In contrast to previous research, this approach makes
   dear assumptions of direction of causality and accommodates a dynamic
   perspective on the emergence of food webs. We apply our approach to
   analysing food webs of the Baltic Sea before and after a previously
   reported regime shift. Our results show that the dominant food web
   processes have remained largely the same, although we detect changes in
   their magnitudes. The results indicate that the reported regime shift
   may not be a system-wide shift, but instead involve a limited number of
   species. Our study emphasizes the importance of community-wide analysis
   on marine regime shifts and introduces a novel approach to examine food

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{997-1007}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The foundational concepts behind the persistence of ecological
   communities have been based on two ecological properties: dynamical
   stability and feasibility. The former is typically regarded as the
   capacity of a community to return to an original equilibrium state after
   a perturbation in species abundances and is usually linked to the
   strength of interspecific interactions. The latter is the capacity to
   sustain positive abundances on all its constituent species and is linked
   to both interspecific interactions and species demographic
   characteristics. Over the last 40years, theoretical research in ecology
   has emphasized the search for conditions leading to the dynamical
   stability of ecological communities, while the conditions leading to
   feasibility have been overlooked. However, thus far, we have no evidence
   of whether species interactions are more conditioned by the community's
   need to be stable or feasible. Here, we introduce novel quantitative
   methods and use empirical data to investigate the consequences of
   species interactions on the dynamical stability and feasibility of
   mutualistic communities. First, we demonstrate that the more nested the
   species interactions in a community are, the lower the mutualistic
   strength that the community can tolerate without losing dynamical
   stability. Second, we show that high feasibility in a community can be
   reached either with high mutualistic strength or with highly nested
   species interactions. Third, we find that during the assembly process of
   a seasonal pollinator community located at The Zackenberg Research
   Station (northeastern Greenland), a high feasibility is reached through
   the nested species interactions established between newcomer and
   resident species. Our findings imply that nested mutualistic communities
   promote feasibility over stability, which may suggest that the former
   can be key for community persistence.}},

Title = {{Unexpected ecotone dynamics of a sand dune vegetation complex following
   water table decline}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{40-50}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   Central Hungarian inland dune ranges harbor heterogeneous grassland
   vegetation with an extensive network of ecotones, arranged perpendicular
   to topography-driven hydrologic gradients. The area suffers from severe
   aridification due to climate change and local anthropogenic factors,
   which have led to a dramatic decline of the water table. As a result,
   groundwater is no longer reachable for low-lying plant communities;
   thus, we expect they are bound to undergo profound changes. This study
   investigates how the plant communities respond to this changing
   environment over time by monitoring ecotones, since they are frequently
   the hotspots of ecosystem change. We monitored five ecotones along
   permanent belt transects for 15 years to characterize their dynamic
   response, and to identify the internal structural changes of the plant
   communities the ecotones delimit.
   Methods
   Ecotones were delineated with the split moving window technique. The
   dynamics of two ecotone parameters, location and contrast, were analyzed
   with linear regression models incorporating two independent variables:
   study year as a measure of time since the loss of groundwater, and
   precipitation as a possible driver of interannual variations. The
   internal changes of the patches separated by the ecotones were analyzed
   using plant functional groups.
   Important Findings
   Precipitation had no detectable effect on the ecotone descriptors, but
   study year influenced ecotones in an unusual fashion. The position of
   the ecotones appeared to be very stable in time; their dynamics are
   stationary, not directional as we predicted. The contrasts had clear
   tendencies; two ecotones disappeared, one new one was formed and two
   ecotones showed no trend. The internal changes of the patches over time
   were dramatic, showing a shift toward more xeric and more open plant
   assemblages in most stretches of the transects. Thus, the dynamic
   response of the vegetation was not patch expansion vs. shrinking, but
   fusion vs. division, which profoundly restructured the vegetation
   pattern. Analysis of plant functional groups revealed that the trends of
   the ecotone contrasts could be traced back to internal changes of the
   patches and not to processes within ecotones. Hence, in situations where
   stationary ecotone dynamics prevail, ecotone position may be a poor
   indicator of the effects of strong directional environmental changes.
   However, in this study we show that ecotone contrast can serve as a
   sensitive tool for monitoring landscape pattern transformations in these
   cases. Also, this highlights the long-term nature of ecotone responses,
   which can have implications in landscape planning and restoration
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{It is natural to regard most animal movement as a continuous-time
   process, generally observed at discrete times. Most existing statistical
   methods for movement data ignore this; the remainder mostly use
   discrete-time approximations, the statistical properties of which have
   not been widely studied, or are limited to special cases. We aim to
   facilitate wider use of continuous-time modelling for realistic
   problems. We develop novel methodology which allows exact Bayesian
   statistical analysis for a rich class of movement models with
   behavioural switching in continuous time, without any need for time
   discretization error. We represent the times of changes in behaviour as
   forming a thinned Poisson process, allowing exact simulation and Markov
   chain Monte Carlo inference. The methodology applies to data that are
   regular or irregular in time, with or without missing values. We apply
   these methods to GPS data from two animals, a fisher (Pekania {[}Martes]
   pennanti) and a wild boar (Sus scrofa), using models with both spatial
   and temporal heterogeneity. We are able to identify and describe
   differences in movement behaviour across habitats and over time. Our
   methods allow exact fitting of realistically complex movement models,
   incorporating environmental information. They also provide an essential
   point of reference for evaluating other existing and future approximate

Abstract = {{Biodiversity conservation in landscapes undergoing climate and land-use
   changes requires designing multipurpose habitat networks that connect
   the movements of organisms at multiple spatial scales. Short-range
   connectivity within habitat networks provides organisms access to
   spatially distributed resources, reduces local extinctions and increases
   recolonization of habitat fragments. Long-range connectivity across
   habitat networks facilitates annual migrations and climate-driven range
   shifts. We present a method for identifying a multipurpose network of
   forest patches that promotes both short- and long-range connectivity.
   Our method uses both graph-theoretic analyses that quantify network
   connectedness and circuit-based analyses that quantify network
   traversability as the basis for identifying spatial conservation
   priorities on the landscape. We illustrate our approach in the
   agroecosystem, bordered by the Laurentian and Appalachian mountain
   ranges, that surrounds the metropolis of Montreal, Canada. We
   established forest conservation priorities for the ovenbird, a
   Neotropical migrant, sensitive to habitat fragmentation that breeds in
   our study area. All connectivity analyses were based on the same
   empirically informed resistance surface for ovenbird, but habitat pixels
   that facilitated short- and long-range connectivity requirements had low
   spatial correlation. The trade-off between connectivity requirements in
   the final ranking of conservation priorities showed a pattern of
   diminishing returns such that beyond a threshold, additional
   conservation of long-range connectivity had decreased effectiveness on
   the conservation of short-range connectivity. Highest conservation
   priority was assigned to a series of stepping stone forest patches
   across the study area that promote traversability between the bordering
   mountain ranges and to a collection of small forest fragments scattered
   throughout the study area that provide connectivity within the
   agroecosystem. Landscape connectivity is important for the ecology and
   genetics of populations threatened by climate change and habitat
   fragmentation. Our method has been illustrated as a means to conserve
   two critical dimensions of connectivity for a single species, but it is
   designed to incorporate a variety of connectivity requirements for many
   species. Our approach can be tailored to local, regional and continental
   conservation initiatives to protect essential species movements that
   will allow biodiversity to persist in a changing climate.}},

   fluorescence (SIF) of chlorophyll, provides for the first time a direct
   measurement related to plant photosynthetic activity (i.e. electron

   crop yield, accounting for stoichiometry, photosynthetic pathways, and
   respiration losses. We apply this framework to estimate United States

   retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 satellite,
   benchmarked with county-level crop yield statistics, and compare it with
   various traditional crop monitoring approaches. We find that a SIF-based
   approach accounting for photosynthetic pathways (i.e. C-3 and C-4 crops)
   provides the best measure of crop productivity among these approaches,
   despite the fact that SIF sensors are not yet optimized for terrestrial
   applications. We further show that SIF provides the ability to infer the
   impacts of environmental stresses on autotrophic respiration and
   carbon-use-efficiency, with a substantial sensitivity of both to high

Abstract = {{Diatoms, an important group of phytoplankton, bloom annually in the
   Southern Ocean, covering thousands of square kilometers and dominating
   the region's phytoplankton communities. In their role as the major food
   source to marine grazers, diatoms supply carbon, nutrients and energy to
   the Southern Ocean food web. Prevailing environmental conditions
   influence diatom phenotypic traits (for example, photophysiology,
   macromolecular composition and morphology), which in turn affect the
   transfer of energy, carbon and nutrients to grazers and higher trophic
   levels, as well as oceanic biogeochemical cycles. The paucity of
   phenotypic data on Southern Ocean phytoplankton limits our understanding
   of the ecosystem and how it may respond to future environmental change.
   Here we used a novel approach to create a `snapshot' of cell phenotype.
   Using mass spectrometry, we measured nitrogen (a proxy for protein),
   total carbon and carbon-13 enrichment (carbon productivity), then used
   this data to build spectroscopy-based predictive models. The models were
   used to provide phenotypic data for samples from a third sample set.
   Importantly, this approach enabled the first ever rate determination of

Abstract = {{We introduce here the term `'River Culture'' to delineate an eco-social
   approach to mitigate the biological and cultural diversity crisis in
   riverscapes. It is based on the insight that current environmental
   change endangers both, biological and cultural diversities in rivers and
   their basins, and those activities to improve ecosystem functions,
   biodiversity and capacity of the biological species to evolve will have
   a similarly positive effect on human cultural diversity. ``River
   Culture{''} has two dimensions, including (a) the influence of the
   biophysical setting of rivers (specifically, their pulsating flow
   regimes and their biological features) on the expression of elements of
   human culture in general and (b) the aspect of ``learning from the
   river{''} for the development of technologies and management options
   that are targeted to maintain and improve ecosystem functions and
   diversity in a more sustainable way. The River Culture approach, as
   given in this concept and discussion paper, is preliminarily based on
   five tenets: (1) Reset values and priorities in riverscape management in
   favor of human wellbeing and a harmonious coexistence of man and
   riverscape; (2) Live in the rhythm of the waters, i.e. adapt management
   options in accordance with the hydrological dynamics rather than
   fighting against them; (3) Transform traditional use of rivers into
   modern cultural activities and management options; (4) `Ecosystem
   bionics': by copying survival strategies of flood-pulse adapted
   organisms novel forms of human use can be developed; (5) Make the
   catchment (river basin) the geographical base unit for all kinds of
   political decisions in landscape management. (C) 2015 European Regional

Volume = {{146}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To provide novel quantification and advanced measurements of
   surface temperatures (T-s) in playgrounds, employing multiple scales of
   data, and provide insight into hot-hazard mitigation techniques and
   designs for improved environmental and public health.
   Methods: We conduct an analysis of T-s in two Metro-Phoenix playgrounds
   at three scales: neighborhood (1 km resolution), microscale (6.8 m
   resolution), and touch-scale (1 cm resolution). Data were derived from
   two sources: airborne remote sensing (neighborhood and microscale) and
   in situ (playground site) infrared T-s (touch-scale). Metrics of
   surface-to-air temperature deltas (Delta Ts-a) and scale offsets
   (errors) are introduced.
   Results: Select in situ T-s in direct sunlight are shown to approach or
   surpass values likely to result in burns to children at touch-scales
   much finer than T-s resolved by airborne remote sensing. Scale offsets
   based On neighbourhood and microscale ground observations are 3.8
   degrees C and 7.3 degrees C less than the Delta Ts-a, at the 1 cm
   touch-scale, respectively, and 6.6 degrees C and 10.1 degrees C lower
   than touch-scale playground equipment T-s, respectively. Hence, the
   coarser scales underestimate high T-s within playgrounds. Both natural
   (tree) and artificial (shade sail) shade types are associated with
   significant reductions in T-s.
   Conclusions: A scale mismatch exists based on differing methods of urban
   T-s measurement. The sub-meter touch-scale is the spatial scale at which
   data must be collected and policies of urban landscape design and health
   must be executed in order to mitigate high T-s in high-contact
   environments such as playgrounds. Shade implementation is the most
   promising mitigation technique to reduce child burns, increase park
   usability, and mitigate urban heating. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{320}},
Pages = {{292-298}},

Abstract = {{Normally the export of carbon from floodplains to a river channel is a
   beneficial process, providing sustenance to lowland river ecosystems.
   However if the rate of oxygen consumption during decomposition of the
   organic carbon is faster than it can be replenished from the atmosphere,
   this can cause hypoxia, with catastrophic short-term consequences for
   aquatic fauna. Because river regulation has disconnected many
   floodplains from their source rivers, floodplain inundation is
   increasingly being actively managed specifically for the benefit of the
   environment. However, the risk of hypoxic blackwater generation must be
   considered during such managed floods. This paper describes a new tool
   for predicting dissolved oxygen and dissolved organic carbon in flood
   return water, using minimal data inputs. The Blackwater Risk Assessment
   Tool (BRAT) is based on the same conceptual framework underpinning an
   earlier, geographically specific, blackwater model. However BRAT differs
   in a number of significant ways from the earlier model. The BRAT is
   based on a generic, rather than site-specific, inundation model; and
   users have the option to use actual hydrographs if these are available.
   Furthermore, most of the algorithms used to model blackwater generation
   processes have been refined, reflecting new knowledge generated since
   the original model was constructed. This includes changes to floodplain
   litter load estimation methods, algorithms for the temperature
   dependence of dissolved organic carbon leaching and biotic uptake, and
   re-aeration rate calculation. Finally, unlike the earlier model, all the
   algorithms and constants in BRAT are readily accessible so that the
   model can be customized to suit floodplain ecosystems other than the
   ones for which it was developed. The model was validated using flood
   events in Koondrook-Perricoota and Gunbower forests, Australia. Model
   outputs were in good agreement with observed dissolved oxygen during
   these flood events with root mean square variation as low as 1.2 mg O-2

Abstract = {{Food web structure dynamics and ecosystem functioning are strongly
   linked, and both are indispensable in evaluating ecosystem development
   in lakes under multiple anthropogenic stressors. However, model-based
   approaches concerning the changes in food web structure and ecosystem
   functioning in a certain lake during distinct periods are scarce. In
   this study, we focus on Lake Chaohu, the fifth-largest lake in China,
   which has undergone drastic changes over the last several decades. Data
   from the 1950s, 1980s and 2000s were used to create three Ecopath
   mass-balance models. These Ecopath models were validated by the stable
   isotope-determined trophic level (TL) for each functional group, which
   indicated an acceptable model performance. Overtime, we observed a
   collapse of the food web toward a simplified structure and decreasing
   biodiversity and trophic interactions. The lake ecosystem was
   approaching an immature but stable status from the 1950s to the 2000s,
   as indicated by the multiple related indicators and the distribution of
   energy flows in slow detrital-based and fast primary producer-based
   channels. We further discuss the potential driving factors and
   underlying mechanisms, hypothesizing that hydrological regulation may
   play a significant role in driving all of these changes in Lake Chaohu
   in addition to eutrophication and intensive fishery. Overall, we
   strongly advocate the identification of a threshold in abundance of
   zooplanktivorous fish, an integrated strategy for future ecological
   restoration in Lake Chaohu, and the consideration of using Ecopath as a
   new management tool for other lakes, thereby bridging the strategies
   from both environmental and ecological perspectives. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Systems ecology is sufficiently developed today to offer a consistent
   theory about ecosystem function due to the contributions from a number
   of system ecologists during the last forty to fifty years. During the
   last five years, additional important contributions to systems ecology
   have been published in Ecological Modelling in the areas of hierarchy
   theory, landscape processes, and thermodynamic indicators. For example,
   research showed that hierarchical organization has an important damping
   effect in the higher levels on disturbances occurring in the lower
   levels and that the damping effect increases with increasing
   biodiversity; this result is consistent with experimental and model
   results. A first attempt has been made to integrate hierarchical and
   network theory on the levels of ecosystems/landscapes using model
   experiments. The model experiments point toward an expansion of the
   Ecological Law of Thermodynamics (ELT) to ecosystems developing on the
   landscape, where it previous was shown valid for populations fitting in
   an ecosystem. Regarding thermodynamic indicators of ecological
   organization, flow transfers were used to quantify the usable work
   energy, including the work energy of information, in ecological
   networks. In particular, this new approach included the cycling of
   information, which is changed by transfers of work energy due to
   different values of the donors and the receptors. These changes,
   however, distribute to all the components of the network. The cardinal
   network hypotheses proposed by B. Patten have been expanded (published
   in this issue of Ecological Modelling) and it has been shown that both
   the maximization of power (the flows of useful work energy) and the
   maximization of the storage of usable work energy including that of
   information in ecosystems' networks are valid and complementary. This
   result represents a first integration of the Maximum Power Hypothesis
   and the Ecological Law of Thermodynamics with Network Theory, and it is
   presumed that a complete integration of all three theories,
   hierarchical, network and thermodynamic, could be expected in the coming
   years. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Foodways in transition: food plants, diet and local perceptions of
   change in a Costa Rican Ngabe community}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Indigenous populations are undergoing rapid ethnobiological,
   nutritional and socioeconomic transitions while being increasingly
   integrated into modernizing societies. To better understand the dynamics
   of these transitions, this article aims to characterize the cultural
   domain of food plants and analyze its relation with current day diets,
   and the local perceptions of changes given amongst the Ngabe people of
   Southern Conte-Burica, Costa Rica, as production of food plants by its
   residents is hypothesized to be drastically in recession with an
   decreased local production in the area and new conservation and
   development paradigms being implemented.
   Methods: Extensive freelisting, interviews and workshops were used to
   collect the data from 72 participants on their knowledge of food plants,
   their current dietary practices and their perceptions of change in local
   foodways, while cultural domain analysis, descriptive statistical
   analyses and development of fundamental explanatory themes were employed
   to analyze the data.
   Results: Results show a food plants domain composed of 140 species, of
   which 85 \% grow in the area, with a medium level of cultural consensus,
   and some age-based variation. Although many plants still grow in the
   area, in many key species a decrease on local production-even
   abandonment-was found, with much reduced cultivation areas. Yet, the
   domain appears to be largely theoretical, with little evidence of use;
   and the diet today is predominantly dependent on foods bought from the
   store (more than 50 \% of basic ingredients), many of which were not
   salient or not even recognized as `food plants' in freelists exercises.
   While changes in the importance of food plants were largely deemed a
   result of changes in cultural preferences for store bought processed
   food stuffs and changing values associated with farming and being food
   self-sufficient, Ngabe were also aware of how changing household
   livelihood activities, and the subsequent loss of knowledge and use of
   food plants, were in fact being driven by changes in social and
   political policies, despite increases in forest cover and biodiversity.
   Conclusions: Ngabe foodways are changing in different and somewhat
   disconnected ways: knowledge of food plants is varied, reflecting most
   relevant changes in dietary practices such as lower cultivation areas
   and greater dependence on food from stores by all families. We attribute
   dietary shifts to socioeconomic and political changes in recent decades,
   in particular to a reduction of local production of food, new economic
   structures and agents related to the State and globalization.}},

   few of the traditional monitoring tools provide the global perspective
   on biodiversity loss and its consequences for ecosystem functioning that
   are now needed. Rather than forcing existing monitoring paradigms to
   respond to questions they were never originally designed to address, we
   need to take a step back and assess the prospects for novel approaches
   that could be developed and adopted in the future. To resolve some of
   the issues with indicators currently used to inform policymakers, we
   highlight new biological monitoring tools that are being used, or could
   be developed in the near future, which (1) consider less-studied
   taxonomic groups, (2) are standardised across regions to allow global

   logistical advances seen in recent years-including remote sensing,
   molecular tools, and local-to-global citizen science networks. We
   recommend that these new indicators should be considered in future

Abstract = {{ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES SOLVE THE BOLL WEEVIL PROBLEM
   The cotton boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis, entered the USA from Mexico
   in 1892 (W. Hunter and Hinds, 1904) and by 1922 had spread across the
   entire cotton-growing region of the southern USA (Showler, 2009). At
   that time cotton was the primary crop in a largely agrarian region, but
   cotton production plummeted following appearance of the weevil. For
   example, weevils destroyed the entire cotton crop of southwestern
   Alabama in 1913 (R.H. Smith, 2007). The first year the boll weevil was
   found statewide in Alabama (1917), cotton production fell 70\% to
   500,000 bales, from a high of 1.7 million bales in 1914 (R.H. Smith,
   2007).
   Early efforts to control the weevil included picking and burning
   infested cotton squares, drowning weevils in kerosene, and a variety of
   home remedies, none of which improved cotton yields. Destroying all
   cotton residue following harvest in the fall and volunteer cotton in
   early spring did reduce weevil damage and was one of the earliest
   recommended control tactics (Howard, 1896). Failed cotton crops caused
   land values to plunge, leading to bankruptcy and mass migration out of
   the region (Hardee and Harris, 2003). However, cotton failure also led
   to diversification of crop production in the South and to a shift in
   cotton production to northern (and later western) regions where the
   weevil was unable to survive colder winters.
   Passage by Congress of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created the
   Cooperative Extension Service, a state-federal cooperative that
   supported hiring of entomologists to advise cotton growers. Calcium
   arsenate dust became available for weevil control in 1918. Initially,
   this was applied by hand as a dust, with no protection for applicators.
   Following World War I aeronautical technology combined with veteran
   pilots led to aerial application methods that could cover larger areas
   with lower exposure to applicators (creating the term ``crop
   duster{''}).
   Calcium arsenate application continued until the 1950s, when more
   effective chlorinated hydrocarbons became available after World War II.
   Initially, dichlorodiphenyltrichlorethane (DDT) was highly effective
   against boll weevil. However, weevil populations in Louisiana were
   resistant to DDT by 1955 (Roussel and Clower, 1957), and resistance was
   soon discovered in other areas. In addition, environmental research
   showed that these chemicals persisted in the environment and become more
   concentrated at higher trophic levels, leading to serious environmental
   concerns (Carson, 1962).
   During this period, organophosphates, such as methyl parathion and
   malathion (developed as nerve gases during World War II), were
   introduced as liquid insecticides. These compounds were highly toxic to
   both weevils and applicators (as well as other vertebrates) but were
   short-lived. During the 1970s, pyrethroids and carbamates were
   introduced. These chemicals also were acutely toxic to insects, but had
   lower toxicity for vertebrates and low persistence. Frequent application
   (12-16 applications per season) of these compounds was required for
   control. In addition, growers became more dependent on insecticides to
   control boll weevils and relied less on cultural and other nonchemical
   options.
   Increasing concern about environmental costs and fear that boll weevils
   would become resistant to newer insecticides, as they had to chlorinated
   hydrocarbons, led to consideration of other options. Advances in
   understanding of weevil ``diapause{''} (Brazzel and Newsom, 1959) and
   pheromone communication (Tumlinson et al., 1969) suggested that
   targeting these key attributes, using a combination of tactics, could
   eliminate this pest. Starting in the mid-1970s, intensive crop
   monitoring with weevil pheromone bait trapped many weevils and indicated
   where weevils were most abundant, typically demes isolated by crop
   diversification. These more restricted sites were targeted for
   application of malathion, the most effective insecticide. These tactics
   were combined with mandated crop destruction soon after harvest to
   deprive weevils of late-season resources and overwintering sites.
   By the mid-1990s, no yield losses to boll weevil were reported in
   Alabama for the first time since 1910 (R.H. Smith, 2007). Furthermore,
   insecticide use was reduced from an average of 10-14 applications per
   season to 1-4 (R.H. Smith, 2007). The last boll weevil in Alabama was
   reported in 2003 (R.H. Smith, 2007). The boll weevil was largely
   eliminated from most other states in the southern USA by 2010.
   This century-long experience with the boll weevil demonstrated three
   major points. First, boll weevil spread was facilitated by extensive
   cultivation of a primary host. Second, crop diversification in the South
   established a more stable economy and limited spread of this and other
   insects. A monument to the boll weevil was dedicated in Enterprise,
   Alabama in 1919 to recognize the weevil's contribution to crop
   diversification and improved economy in Coffee County. Third, the
   successful removal of boll weevil as a factor affecting cotton
   production was achieved ultimately through application of ecological
   research to target critical aspects of weevil life history, with
   insecticides used as a last resort on isolated demes.}},

Abstract = {{The behavioural ecology of Antarctic krill is dominated by their
   tendency to swarm. They form amongst the largest monospecific
   aggregations of biomass in the animal kingdom, with some swarms
   measuring up to 100 km(2) and containing 2 million tonnes of krill.
   Swarms come in a multitude of shapes and sizes, and a greater
   understanding of the functional attributes of different swarm types is
   starting to emerge. This chapter will consider the spectrum of
   krill-swarms and -schools that have been described and some of the
   latest approaches taken to understand their shape and formation. The
   fundamental needs to avoid predation, feed, mate and spawn have often
   been attributed to being a major influence on swarming and we will
   examine these behaviours and their wider impacts. This chapter also
   considers how krill position themselves in the water column, altering
   their depth over diel and seasonal cycles, with further levels of
   modification depending on the environmental context. The ability of
   krill to migrate large distances is a major ecological feature of the
   Southern Ocean ecosystem, affecting the productivity of both planktonic
   and upper-trophic level communities, and we consider how such migrations
   are driven at the level of the swarm. New technologies are emerging that
   are providing previously unreported krill behaviours and we assess the
   future potential of these technologies to develop an even deeper
   appreciation of krill ethology. Also, we assess what impact predicted
   changes to the Southern Ocean environment will have on krill behavioural
   traits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is a comprehensive and updated overview of river restoration
   and covers all relevant aspects from drivers of restoration, linkages
   between hydromorphology and biota, the current restoration paradigm,
   effects of restorations to future directions and ways forward in the way
   we conduct river restoration. A large part of this paper is based on the
   outcomes of the REFORM (REstoring rivers FOR effective catchment
   Management, http://reformrivers.eu/) project that was funded by EU's 7th
   Framework Programme (2011-15). REFORM included the most comprehensive
   comparison, to date, of existing river restorations across Europe and
   their effect on biota, both in relation to preintervention state and
   project size in terms of river length restored. The REFORM project
   outcomes are supplemented by an extensive literature review and two case
   studies to illustrate key points. We conclude that river restorations
   conducted up until now have had highly variable effects with, on
   balance, more positives than negatives. The largest positive effects
   have interestingly been in terrestrial and semiaquatic organism groups,
   in widening projects, while positive effects on truly aquatic organisms
   groups are only seen when in-stream measures are applied. The positive
   responses of biota are primarily seen as increased abundance of
   organisms with very little indication that overall biodiversity has
   increased: specific traits rather than mere species number or total
   abundance have benefited from restoration interventions. This modest
   success rate can partly be attributed to the fact that the catchment
   filter is largely ignored; large-scale pressures related to catchment
   land use or the lack of source populations for the recolonisation of the
   restored habitats are inadequately considered. The key reason for this
   shortfall is a lack of clear objective setting and planning processes.
   Furthermore, we suggest that there has been a focus on form rather than
   processes and functioning in river restoration, which has truncated the
   evolution of geomorphic features and any dynamic interaction with biota.
   Finally, monitoring of restoration outcomes is still rare and often uses
   inadequate statistical designs and inappropriate biological methods
   which hamper our ability to detect change.}},

   Harbour and its Environs, on the Mid-north Coast of New South Wales,
   c1861-2000}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY OF NEW SOUTH WALES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{1-48}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on changes to the Koala population of the Coffs
   Harbour Local Government Area, on the mid-north coast of New South
   Wales, from European settlement to 2000. The primary method used was
   media analysis, complemented by local histories, reports and annual
   reviews of fur/skin brokers, historical photographs, and oral histories.
   Cedar-cutters worked their way up the Orara River in the 1870s, paving
   the way for selection, and the first wave of European settlers arrived
   in the early 1880s. Much of the initial development arose from logging.
   The trade in marsupial skins and furs did not constitute a significant
   threat to the Koala population of Coffs Harbour in the late nineteenth
   and early twentieth centuries. The extent of the vegetation clearing by
   the early 1900s is apparent in photographs. Consistent with the probable
   presence of Koalas in the Coffs Harbour town centre in the early 1900s,
   available evidence for the period 1920-1950s strongly suggests that
   Koalas remained present in the town centre and surrounding area.
   Large-scale development began in the early 1960s. Comparing aerial
   photographs allows us to discern the speed of change from a largely
   rural landscape in 1964 to one that is predominantly urbanised by 2009.
   The 1999 Comprehensive Koala Plan of Management for Coffs Harbour City
   Council, drawing on the 1990 Community Survey of Koalas in Coffs
   Harbour, detailed specific examples of habitat fragmentation through
   development. Local media coverage offered a wealth of information on the
   persistence, and rapid eradication, of Koala habitat over the
   1970s-2000, in addition to the level of community interest in the issue.
   Taken collectively, the evidence allows us to draw two main conclusions:
   that the Koala population of Coffs Harbour was widespread but never
   abundant, and that habitat loss has been relentless since European
   settlement. The transformation of a rural-forest to a largely urban
   landscape, particularly in the south-east of the Local Government Area,
   over the past four decades is the most recent stage in the incremental
   loss of habitat since European settlement. Consequently, the conclusion
   can be drawn that the Koala population had been reduced from its
   pre-European size by 2000. Concurrent research on the Coffs Harbour
   Koala population showed that it declined during the 1980s, but was
   relatively stable and endured over the period 1990-2011. These findings
   point to the necessity of employing historical analysis to interpret
   change in Koala populations in Coffs Harbour to complement current
   assessments of population status.}},

   response to tree invasions}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{Establishing mutualistic interactions in novel environments is important
   for the successful establishment of some non-native plant species. These
   associations may, in turn, impact native species interaction networks as
   non-natives become dominant in their new environments. Using
   phylogenetic and ecological interaction network approaches we provide
   the first report of the structure of belowground legume-rhizobium
   interaction networks and how they change along a gradient of invasion
   (uninvaded, semi invaded and heavily invaded sites) by Australian Acacia
   species in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We found that native
   and invasive legumes interact with distinct rhizobial lineages, most
   likely due to phylogenetic uniqueness of native and invasive host
   plants. Moreover, legume-rhizobium interaction networks are not nested,
   but significantly modular with high levels of specialization possibly as
   a result of legume-rhizobium co-evolution. Although network topology
   remained constant across the invasion gradient, composition of bacterial
   communities associated with native legumes changed dramatically as
   acacias increasingly dominated the landscape. In stark contrast to
   aboveground interaction networks (e.g. pollination and seed dispersal)
   we show that invasive legumes do not infiltrate existing native
   legume-rhizobium networks but rather form novel modules. This absence of
   mutualist overlap between native and invasive legumes suggests the
   importance of co-invading rhizobium-acacia species complexes for Acacia
   invasion success, and argues against a ubiquitous role for the formation
   and evolutionary refinement of novel interactions.}},

Abstract = {{How might we begin to explore the concept of the ``sustainable city{''}
   in a world often characterized as dynamic, fluid, and contested? Debates
   about the sustainable city are too often dominated by a technological
   discourse conducted among professional experts, but this technocratic
   framing is open to challenge. For some critics, sustainability is a
   meaningless notion, yet for others its semantic pliability opens up
   discursive spaces through which to explore interconnections across time,
   space, and scale. Thus, while enacting sustainability in policy and
   practice is an arduous task, we can productively ask how cultural
   imaginations might be stirred and shaken to make sustainability
   accessible to a wider public who might join the conversation. What role,
   we ask, can and should the arts play in wider debates about
   sustainability in the city today? We explore a coproduced artwork in the
   northeast of England in order to explain how practice-led research
   methods were put into dialogue with the social sciences to activate new
   perspectives on the politics, aesthetics, and practices of
   sustainability. The case is presented to argue that creative material
   experimentations can be used as an active research inquiry through which
   ideas can be tested without knowing predefined means or ends. The case

   in Aotearoa-New Zealand}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{In response to widespread water quality and quantity issues, the New
   Zealand Government has recently embarked on a number of comprehensive
   freshwater management reforms, developing a raft of national discussion
   and policy documents such as ``Freshwater Reform 2013 and Beyond{''} and
   a National Policy Statement for freshwater management (NPS-FM 2014).
   Recent resource management reforms and amendments (RMA 2014), based on
   previous overarching resource management legislation (RMA 1991), set out
   a new approach and pathway to manage freshwater nationwide.
   Internationally, there is an increasing trend to engage with indigenous
   communities for research and collaboration, including indigenous groups
   as active participants in resource management decision making. What is
   driving this change toward more engagement and collaboration with
   indigenous communities is different for each country, and we document
   the progress and innovation made in this area in New Zealand. The
   indigenous rights of Maori in New Zealand are stated in the 1840 Treaty
   of Waitangi and in many forms of New Zealand's legislation. Local and
   central governments are eager to include local indigenous Maori groups
   (iwi/hapu) in freshwater management planning processes through
   meaningful engagement and collaboration. Key to the success of
   collaborative planning processes for Maori are enduring relationships
   between local government and Maori, along with adequate resourcing for
   all partners contributing to the collaborative process. A large number
   of shared governance and management models for natural resource
   management have emerged in New Zealand over the past 20 years, and some
   recent examples are reviewed. We provide some discussion to improve
   understanding and use of the terms used in these management models such
   as cogovernance, comanagement, and coplanning, and describe some of the
   more important frameworks and tools being developed with Maori groups
   (e.g., iwi/hapu), to strengthen Maori capacity in freshwater management
   and to support good collaborative process and planning.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{When something unfamiliar emerges or when something familiar does
   something unexpected people need to make sense of what is emerging or
   going on in order to act. Social representations theory suggests how
   individuals and society make sense of the unfamiliar and hence how the
   resultant social representations (SRs) cognitively, emotionally, and
   actively orient people and enable communication. SRs are social
   constructions that emerge through individual and collective engagement
   with media and with everyday conversations among people. Recent
   developments in text analysis techniques, and in particular topic
   modeling, provide a potentially powerful analytical method to examine
   the structure and content of SRs using large samples of narrative or
   text. In this paper I describe the methods and results of applying topic
   modeling to 660 micronarratives collected from Australian
   academics/researchers, government employees, and members of the public
   in 2010-2011. The narrative fragments focused on adaptation to climate
   change (CC) and hence provide an example of Australian society making
   sense of an emerging and conflict ridden phenomena. The results of the
   topic modeling reflect elements of SRs of adaptation to CC that are
   consistent with findings in the literature as well as being reasonably
   robust predictors of classes of action in response to CC. Bayesian
   Network (BN) modeling was used to identify relationships among the
   topics (SR elements) and in particular to identify relationships among
   topics, sentiment, and action. Finally the resulting model and topic
   modeling results are used to highlight differences in the salience of SR
   elements among social groups. The approach of linking topic modeling and
   BN modeling offers a new and encouraging approach to analysis for
   ongoing research on SRs.}},

Title = {{Multilevel governance in community-based environmental management: a
   case study comparison from Latin America}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{We analyze four case studies from Latin America using the concept of
   multilevel governance to assess at what vertical and horizontal levels
   and in what roles various state, market, and civil society actors
   interact for successful community-based environmental management (CBEM).
   In particular, we address the problem of how a conflict over natural
   resources with high negative impacts on the livelihoods of the
   respective communities could be overcome by a governance change that
   resulted in a multilevel governance arrangement for CBEM. The analysis
   involves a mixed-methods approach that combines a variety of empirical
   methods in social research such as field visits, personal interviews,
   participant observations, and stakeholder workshops. To visualize
   results, we introduce two schemes to present the composition of the
   governance structures for cross-case comparison. The first scheme plots
   the different actors into an arrangement that shows their associations
   with different societal spheres and at which territorial scales they are
   primarily involved. The second scheme differentiates these actors based
   on their complementing governance roles. Active roles are attributed to
   actors who implement activities on the ground, whereas passive roles are
   assigned to actors who provide specific resources such as knowledge,
   funding, legislative framework, or others. All cases involved governance
   actors from more than one societal sphere who operate on at least three
   different territorial levels (local to international) and in distinct
   roles. Results show that multilevel governance can strengthen CBEM in
   different ways. First, the success of CBEM is an outcome of the sum of
   horizontal and vertical interactions of all involved actors, and there
   is no most appropriate single level of social organization at which a
   problem can best be addressed. Only the cooperation of actors from
   different societal spheres within and across levels ensures
   accessibility to needed resources and implementation on the ground.
   Second, civil society actors seem to be crucial actors because they
   often function as the initiators of governance change and as bridging
   actors who connect other actors across levels. Third, to enable
   cross-scale interaction for improved decision making, often new actors
   are formed whose roles are wilfully negotiated. Fourth, despite
   different interests of actors, all multilevel governance arrangements
   for CBEM were able to provide benefits to all actors. Finally, in all
   cases, procedures for conflict resolution among parties are in place to
   address problems and allow for polycentric mutual decision making.
   Nevertheless, in view of transferability of the analyzed multilevel
   governance arrangements for CBEM, it is important to acknowledge that
   the differentiation in the cooperation of actors characterizes complex
   solutions that work for a specific context and that cannot be
   transferred directly to another context.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of sustainable development means all forms and methods of
   socioeconomic development not only in the short or medium term, but also
   long term, of which basis is primarily a balance between socio-economic
   systems and elements of natural capital. Currently, the concept of rural
   development is based on the concept of sustainable development and has
   some fundamental features, referring to sustainable rural development,
   rural multisectoral development and integrated rural development.
   Romanian Village Development is a topic of great interest, both
   theoretical and especially practical for various fields - social,
   economic, political etc. Once Romania joins the European Union, the
   countryside has undergone major changes and has seen a special dynamic,
   thanks to the many challenges imposed by some European standards which
   have created new prospects for development, but also brought new
   problems. Residents and authorities managed more or less efficiently
   these problems in rural areas, based on managerial competence,
   resistance to change residents and other external factors. The present
   paper relate the identification of the level of understanding of
   sustainable development concept and rural development in local
   authorities and was conducted in 2011 through a qualitative study,
   otherwise, the application of an interview guide in 22 communes in Timis
   county, located around Timisoara city. This qualitative study was part
   of my PhD thesis entitled ``A Romanian perspective on reconstruction in
   the Countryside area of the Euroregion DKMT sustainable development{''},
   held in 2012. The answers were varied and very diverse, but if all these
   answers would gather into one, it would be close with the meaning of
   these concepts defined in the specialty literature. After analyzing the
   responses of the interview guide, we can state that the representatives
   local authority interviewed could not define the concepts of sustainable
   development and rural development, with the literature data. This is due
   to either lack of information, or low local interest in the subject,
   confusing sustainable development with rural development, or vice versa,
   or for other reasons. Educating people, helping them to acquire
   knowledge about the complex interplay between economic, social and
   environment in the local community by expanding knowledge on the links
   between human society and the environment and to identify technical and
   social solutions, will lead to a more detailed understanding of the
   concept of sustainable development and rural development, leading on
   medium-term to the development of rural areas and reconstruction of the
   Romanian village.}},

Title = {{Recent decline of an endangered, endemic rodent: does exclusion of
   disturbance play a role for Hastings River mouse (Pseudomys oralis)?}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{482-491}},
Abstract = {{Context. The role of disturbance and its exclusion is fundamental to the
   conservation of threatened species.
   Aims. We used the habitat accommodation model as a framework to
   investigate the importance of forest disturbance for the endangered
   Hastings River mouse, Pseudomys oralis, focusing on timber harvesting.
   Methods. Our study comprised two separate surveys. We resurveyed old
   survey sites (n = 24) where the species was originally recorded as
   either present (logging excluded) or absent (subsequently logged). A
   second survey targeted trapping in high-quality habitat stratified by
   different times since logging. Finally, we analysed a 15-year trapping
   dataset targeting P. oralis to assess associations with co-occurring
   species.
   Key results. The resurvey of old sites resulted in 12 P. oralis
   individuals being trapped, compared with 46 individuals in original
   surveys. Substantial declines were observed over time in transects where
   logging was excluded (60-82\% decline), whereas there was little change
   at transects where P. oralis was not previously trapped and that were
   subsequently logged. The second survey yielded 27 P. oralis captures at
   post-logging sites assessed as high quality. Occupancy was very high
   (psi = 0.93 +/- 0.21) in transects logged 7-15 years ago and was 60\%
   less in transects where logging was excluded for 35-45 years (psi = 0.37
   +/- 0.22), whereas occupancy in transects logged 2-6 years ago was
   intermediate. This pattern of higher occupancy in logged areas was
   mirrored for the mean number of P. oralis trapped per transect.
   Ordination of habitat data showed an association of P. oralis with
   heath, mat-rushes and logs, whereas rats (Rattus and Melomys) were
   associated with ferns and shrubs. Camera traps revealed low background
   levels of predator presence. A negative exponential relationship was
   found between probability of occupancy of P. oralis and rat abundance
   from a 15-year trapping dataset (44 275 trap-nights), suggesting that
   rats may compete with P. oralis.
   Conclusions. Our results supported the habitat accommodation model and
   suggested that disturbance is likely to influence the persistence of P.
   oralis. However, an interaction between predation and loss of cover from
   high-frequency disturbance (fire or intense grazing) cannot be excluded
   as a key threat.
   Implications. Disturbance should be incorporated into the management of
   some species. Adaptive monitoring is recommended to assess alternative
   management regimes.}},

Title = {{The governance of adaptation: choices, reasons, and effects.
   Introduction to the Special Feature}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{The governance of climate adaptation involves the collective efforts of
   multiple societal actors to address problems, or to reap the benefits,
   associated with impacts of climate change. Governing involves the
   creation of institutions, rules and organizations, and the selection of
   normative principles to guide problem solution and institution building.
   We argue that actors involved in governing climate change adaptation, as
   climate change governance regimes evolve, inevitably must engage in
   making choices, for instance on problem definitions, jurisdictional
   levels, on modes of governance and policy instruments, and on the timing
   of interventions. Yet little is known about how and why these choices
   are made in practice, and how such choices affect the outcomes of our
   efforts to govern adaptation. In this introduction we review the current
   state of evidence and the specific contribution of the articles
   published in this Special Feature, which are aimed at bringing greater
   clarity in these matters, and thereby informing both governance theory
   and practice. Collectively, the contributing papers suggest that the way
   issues are defined has important consequences for the support for
   governance interventions, and their effectiveness. The articles suggest
   that currently the emphasis in adaptation governance is on the local and
   regional levels, while underscoring the benefits of interventions and
   governance at higher jurisdictional levels in terms of visioning and
   scaling-up effective approaches. The articles suggest that there is a
   central role of government agencies in leading governance interventions
   to address spillover effects, to provide public goods, and to promote
   the long-term perspectives for planning. They highlight the issue of
   justice in the governance of adaptation showing how governance measures
   have wide distributional consequences, including the potential to
   amplify existing inequalities, access to resources, or generating new
   injustices through distribution of risks. For several of these findings,
   future research directions are suggested.}},

   not allow an unambiguous subdivision of the complex. However, the
   populations of a mountain or a mountain ridge share characteristic
   combinations of shell characters so that they can be classified as
   geographic subspecies. The delimitation of the subspecies and their

Abstract = {{In the midst of a major extinction crisis, the scientific community is
   called to provide criteria, variables and standards for defining
   strategies of biodiversity conservation and monitoring their results.
   Phylogenetic diversity is one of the variables taken in account. Its
   consideration in biodiversity conservation stemmed from the idea that
   species are not equal in terms of evolutionary history and opened a
   completely new line of investigation. It has turned the focus to the
   need of protecting the Tree of Life, i.e. the diversity of features
   resulting from the evolution of Life on Earth. This approach is now
   recognized as a strategy for increasing options for future needs and
   values as well as for increasing the potential of biodiversity
   diversification in a future environment. Since its introduction in
   biodiversity conservation thinking much has been developed in order to
   compose our conceptual understanding of the importance of protecting the
   Tree of Life. The aim of this book is to contribute to the ongoing
   international construction of strategies for reducing biodiversity
   losses by exploring several approaches for the conservation of
   phylogenetic diversity. We hope that this concentrated effort will
   contribute to the emergence of new solutions and attitudes towards a
   more effective preservation of our evolutionary heritage. The chapters
   of this book are organized around three main themes: questions, methods
   and applications, providing a condensed updated picture of the state of
   the art and showing that either conceptually or methodologically
   phylogenetic diversity has everything to be on the global agenda of
   biodiversity conservation.}},

Title = {{Land-cover patterns surrounding Caucasian grouse leks in Arasbaran
   region, East Azerbaijan, Iran}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{267-275}},
Abstract = {{Context To create management strategies with the goal of sustaining a
   species such as Caucasian grouse (Lyrurus mlokosiewiczi), it is
   important to identify the habitat requirements of species, not just in
   terms of a correlation with a given habitat feature, but also the
   relationship between species presence and vegetation coverage, proximity
   to other habitat types, and importance at different spatial scales.
   Aims To predict the proportions and spatial configuration of major
   habitat types that are associated with high probabilities of Caucasian
   grouse lek occurrence.
   Methods Using minimum mapping-unit scale (i.e. grain) for land cover, we
   applied spatial analysis at three spatial extents (472-, 702- and
   867-m-radius circles) to assess how the importance of different
   land-cover patterns and patch characteristics surrounding leks of
   Caucasian grouse changed with scale within the Arasbaran landscape
   (316.56km(2)) in East Azerbaijan, Iran. A set of a priori models has
   been developed on the basis of landscape metrics linked to hypotheses
   that could explain the spatial pattern of Caucasian black habitat use at
   each scale. We used an information-theoretic approach based on Akaike's
   information criterion (AIC) within a general additive models framework
   to model habitat selection, so as to compare the values of landscape
   metrics calculated for Caucasian grouse lek sites (n=22) with those
   calculated for non-lek points (n=44).
   Key results The probability of lek occurrence at each of the spatial
   scales increases with a larger amount of open, young forests in the
   landscape. At each scale, we could indicate the landscape composition
   and structure required to create an ideal habitat mosaic for Caucasian
   grouse. Such an ideal habitat mosaic within mountain forests of
   Arasbaran, for a 702-m-radius area around a potential lek site, would
   consist of non-square (i.e. more geometrically complex) patches of
   rangeland cover and deciduous stands with canopy cover of <50\%, which
   encompass over 30\% of landscape.
   Conclusions Our results identified differences in black grouse
   requirements at several scales within the landscape. We believe this
   will help managers improve the habitat focusing on the area around
   existing or inactive leks, to adapt the landscape to species
   requirements, and to encourage targeting new sites.
   Implications These findings demonstrated that not only can we identify
   important landscape requirements at a range of scales, but by
   characterising landscape composition and structure across these scales,
   forest managers can help prioritise combinations of habitats that best
   serve the conservation of the target species.}},

   to warming}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1733-1752}},
Abstract = {{Recent developments in modelling soil organic carbon decomposition
   include the explicit incorporation of enzyme and microbial dynamics. A
   characteristic of these models is a positive feedback between substrate
   and consumers, which is absent in traditional first-order decay models.
   With sufficiently large substrate, this feedback allows an unconstrained
   growth of microbial biomass. We explore mechanisms that curb
   unrestricted microbial growth by including finite potential sites where
   enzymes can bind and by allowing microbial scavenging for enzymes. We
   further developed a model where enzyme synthesis is not scaled to
   microbial biomass but associated with a respiratory cost and microbial
   population adjusts enzyme production in order to optimise their growth.
   We then tested short-and long-term responses of these models to a step
   increase in temperature and find that these models differ in the
   long-term when short-term responses are harmonised. We show that several
   mechanisms, including substrate limitation, variable production of
   microbial enzymes, and microbes feeding on extracellular enzymes
   eliminate oscillations arising from a positive feedback between
   microbial biomass and depolymerisation. The model where enzyme
   production is optimised to yield maximum microbial growth shows the
   strongest reduction in soil organic carbon in response to warming, and
   the trajectory of soil carbon largely follows that of a first-order
   decomposition model. Modifications to separate growth and maintenance
   respiration generally yield short-term differences, but results converge
   over time because microbial biomass approaches a quasi-equilibrium with
   the new conditions of carbon supply and temperature.}},

Title = {{Changes in composition, ecology and structure of high-mountain
   vegetation: a re-visitation study over 42 years}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{High-mountain ecosystems are increasingly threatened by climate change,
   causing biodiversity loss, habitat degradation and landscape
   modifications. However, very few detailed studies have focussed on plant
   biodiversity in the high mountains of the Mediterranean. In this study,
   we investigated the long-term changes that have occurred in the
   composition, structure and ecology of high-mountain vegetation in the
   central Apennines (Majella) over the last 42 years. We performed a
   re-visitation study, using historical and newly collected vegetation
   data to explore which ecological and structural features have been the
   most successful in coping with climatic changes. Vegetation changes were
   analysed by comparing geo-referenced phytosociological releves collected
   in high-mountain habitats (dolines, gentle slopes and ridges) on the
   Majella massif in 1972 and in 2014. Composition analysis was performed
   by detrended correspondence analysis, followed by an analysis of
   similarities for statistical significance assessment and by similarity
   percentage procedure (SIMPER) for identifying which species indicate
   temporal changes. Changes in ecological and structural indicators were
   analysed by a permutational multivariate analysis of variance, followed
   by a post hoc comparison. Over the last 42 years, clear floristic
   changes and significant ecological and structural variations occurred.
   We observed a significant increase in the thermophilic and
   mesonitrophilic plant species and an increment in the frequencies of
   hemicryptophytes. This re-visitation study in the Apennines agrees with
   observations in other alpine ecosystems, providing new insights for a
   better understanding of the effects of global change on Mediterranean
   high-mountain biodiversity. The observed changes in floristic
   composition, the thermophilization process and the shift towards a more
   nutrient-demanding vegetation are likely attributable to the combined
   effect of higher temperatures and the increase in soil nutrients
   triggered by global change. The re-visitation approach adopted herein
   represents a powerful tool for studying climate-related changes in
   sensitive high-mountain habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change may be a game-changer for scientific research by
   promoting a science that is grounded in linking the production of
   knowledge and societal action in a transition toward more sustainable
   development pathways. Here, we discuss participatory action-research
   (PAR) as a way of thinking and leading investigations that may promote
   incremental and transformative changes in the context of climate change
   adaptation research. Our exploration is addressed in the Portuguese
   context, where PAR and sustainable transition studies are still
   marginal, and adaptation processes are a recent topic on political
   agendas. We describe the characteristics of PAR and use two studies of
   adaptation to illustrate how research and practice co-evolve through
   interactive cycles. The two studies are works in progress, rather than
   completed PAR processes. Climate change adaptation is an ongoing and
   long-term process. Moreover, in Portugal, as in many regions of the
   world, climate change adaptation is a fairly new topic. Thus, both case
   studies are now initiating a long-term process of change and adaptation.
   The completion of one research cycle is a realistic expectation that we
   have achieved in the two case study experiences. In our discussion of
   the case studies, we consider how these experiences provide insights
   into the role of PAR for long-term regime changes. We conclude by
   pointing to the societal needs addressed by PAR, as a pragmatically
   oriented and context-specific research design. The approach can be
   complementary to other frameworks in sustainable transition studies such
   as transition management. Being more pragmatically oriented, PAR cycles
   may influence incrementally transformative changes that can be guided by
   transition management's long-term design for governing sustainable
   transitions.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Around the world, the decreasing health of coral reef ecosystems has
   highlighted the need to better understand the processes of reef
   degradation. The development of more sensitive tools, which complement
   traditional methods of monitoring coral reefs, may reveal earlier signs
   of degradation and provide an opportunity for pre-emptive responses. We
   identify new, sensitive metrics of ecosystem processes and benthic
   composition that allow us to quantify subtle, yet destabilizing, changes
   in the ecosystem state of an inshore coral reef on the Great Barrier
   Reef. Following severe climatic disturbances over the period 2011-2012,
   the herbivorous reef fish community of the reef did not change in terms
   of biomass or functional groups present. However, fish-based ecosystem
   processes showed marked changes, with grazing by herbivorous fishes
   declining by over 90\%. On the benthos, algal turf lengths in the
   epilithic algal matrix increased more than 50\% while benthic sediment
   loads increased 37-fold. The profound changes in processes, despite no
   visible change in ecosystem state, i.e., no shift to macroalgal
   dominance, suggest that although the reef has not undergone a visible
   regime-shift, the ecosystem is highly unstable, and may sit on an
   ecological knife-edge. Sensitive, process-based metrics of ecosystem
   state, such as grazing or browsing rates thus appear to be effective in
   detecting subtle signs of degradation and may be critical in identifying
   ecosystems at risk for the future.}},

Title = {{Variability of projected terrestrial biosphere responses to elevated

   fixation}},

Abstract = {{Including a terrestrial nitrogen (N) cycle in Earth system models has
   led to substantial attenuation of predicted biosphere-climate feedbacks.
   However, the magnitude of this attenuation remains uncertain. A
   particularly important but highly uncertain process is biological
   nitrogen fixation (BNF), which is the largest natural input of N to land
   ecosystems globally. In order to quantify this uncertainty and estimate
   likely effects on terrestrial biosphere dynamics, we applied six
   alternative formulations of BNF spanning the range of process
   formulations in current state-of-the-art biosphere models within a
   common framework, the O-CN model: a global map of static BNF rates, two
   empirical relationships between BNF and other ecosystem variables (net
   primary productivity and evapotranspiration), two process-oriented
   formulations based on plant N status, and an optimality-based approach.
   We examined the resulting differences in model predictions under ambient
   and elevated atmospheric {[}CO2] and found that the predicted global BNF
   rates and their spatial distribution for contemporary conditions were
   broadly comparable, ranging from 108 to 148 TgNyr(-1) (median: 128
   TgNyr(-1)), despite distinct regional patterns associated with the
   assumptions of each approach. Notwithstanding, model responses in BNF
   rates to elevated levels of atmospheric {[}CO2] (+200 ppm) ranged
   between 4 TgNyr(-1) (-3\%) and 56 TgNyr(-1) (+42 \%) (median: 7
   TgNyr(-1) (+8 \%)). As a consequence, future projections of global
   ecosystem carbon (C) storage (+ 281 to +353 Pg C, or +13 to +16 \%) as
   well as N2O emission (-1.6 to +0.5 TgNyr(-1), or -19 to +7 \%) differed
   significantly across the different model formulations. Our results
   emphasize the importance of better understanding the nature and
   magnitude of BNF responses to change-induced perturbations, particularly
   through new empirical perturbation experiments and improved model
   representation.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture is the principal economic activity of Nepal contributing
   about 35 \% to the national GDP and engaging about 66 \% of the
   population. Existing low productivity of agriculture has resulted in
   food insecure and food deficit nation. Degradation of resources, mainly
   land, water, agrobiodiversity, and forest, is believed to be the
   immediate cause for the low productivity. Therefore, agricultural
   practices those conserve and promote productivity level while
   regenerating the degraded natural resource are of paramount importance
   in Nepal. Organic farming has been proven as one of such practices as it
   promotes and maintains soil and human health, manages and enhances
   biodiversity, and offers better nutrient cycling and mineralization with
   favorable microclimatic regimes, and thereby less risk to farmers. Till
   the recent past, agriculture in Nepal was organic with self-sustained
   method of production relying on integration of local biodiversity using
   traditional knowledge and wisdom. However, for the last three decades,
   use of high yielding exotic crops/varieties and agrochemicals,
   introduced under the banner of Green Revolution Agriculture (GRA), has
   become pervasive. Although, GRA served its short-term propose to some
   extent to increase the production of major food crops, over the time,
   the indiscriminate use of external non-organic inputs resulted in soil
   degradation, loss of biodiversity, food poisoning, environmental
   pollution, and threat to sustainability and food security. This
   devastating scenario compelled the stakeholders to think of alternative
   resilient practices as a long-term solution to conserving the resource
   base and salvaging the environment. Organic agriculture, as advocated
   and promoted by International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movement
   (IFOAM) based on worldwide research results, can be instrumental to
   address the current as well as long-term problems of agriculture in
   Nepal. The practice of organic agriculture is not new for Nepalese
   farmers because it is a traditional mainstream food production system
   from the time immemorial. However, as a movement, organic agriculture
   has emerged as a new intervention in farming in recent years.
   Development of addictive sense toward chemical-based farming made
   difficult to convince farmers about immediate and long-term advantage of
   organic agriculture. Therefore, non-government organizations are
   involved to advocate, promote, and popularize organic farming with
   policy support from the government. Growing health and environmental
   consciousness against chemical farming among consumers has helped the
   movement advance faster. At present, many conscious farmers,
   entrepreneurs, and academic and development institutions are focusing
   their efforts to promote organic farming in the country. Government has
   also formulated some policies favoring the shift from chemical-based
   farming to organic farming. This chapter focuses on general features on
   the past and present of Nepalese agriculture; its resource base;
   declining productivity and sustainability; and the role of organic
   farming as a viable option for food security and livelihood
   sustainability in Nepal.}},

Abstract = {{Forests are more frequently being managed to store and sequester carbon
   for the purposes of climate change mitigation. Generally, this practice
   involves long-term conservation of intact mature forests and/or
   reductions in the frequency and intensity of timber harvests. However,
   incorporating the influence of forest surface albedo often suggests that
   long rotation lengths may not always be optimal in mitigating climate
   change in forests characterized by frequent snowfall. To address this,
   we investigated trade-offs between three ecosystem services: carbon
   storage, albedo-related radiative forcing, and timber provisioning. We
   calculated optimal rotation length at 498 diverse Forest Inventory and
   Analysis forest sites in the state of New Hampshire, USA. We found that
   the mean optimal rotation lengths across all sites was 94 yr (standard
   deviation of sample means = 44 yr), with a large cluster of short
   optimal rotation lengths that were calculated at high elevations in the
   White Mountain National Forest. Using a regression tree approach, we
   found that timber growth, annual storage of carbon, and the difference
   between annual albedo in mature forest vs. a post-harvest landscape were
   the most important variables that influenced optimal rotation.
   Additionally, we found that the choice of a baseline albedo value for
   each site significantly altered the optimal rotation lengths across all
   sites, lowering the mean rotation to 59 yr with a high albedo baseline,
   and increasing the mean rotation to 112 yr given a low albedo baseline.
   Given these results, we suggest that utilizing temperate forests in New
   Hampshire for climate mitigation purposes through carbon storage and the
   cessation of harvest is appropriate at a site-dependent level that
   varies significantly across the state.}},

Pages = {{279-294}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive management is a framework for resolving key uncertainties while
   managing complex ecological systems. Its use has been prominent in
   fisheries research and wildlife harvesting; however, its application to
   other areas of environmental management remains somewhat limited.
   Indeed, adaptive management has not been used to guide and inform
   metapopulation restoration, despite considerable uncertainty surrounding
   such actions. In this study, we determined how best to learn about the
   colonization rate when managing metapopulations under an adaptive
   management framework. We developed a mainland-island metapopulation
   model based on the threatened bay checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas
   editha bayensis) and assessed three management approaches: adding new
   patches, adding area to existing patches, and doing nothing. Using
   stochastic dynamic programming, we found the optimal passive and active
   adaptive management strategies by monitoring colonization of vacant
   patches. Under a passive adaptive strategy, increasing patch area was
   best when the expected colonization rate was below a threshold;
   otherwise, adding new patches was optimal. Under an active adaptive
   strategy, it was best to add patches only when we were reasonably
   confident that the colonization rate was high. This research provides a
   framework for managing mainland-island metapopulations in the face of
   uncertainty while learning about the dynamics of these complex systems.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing reliance on ecological models to improve our
   understanding of how ecological systems work, to project likely outcomes
   under alternative global change scenarios and to help develop robust
   management strategies. Two common types of spatiotemporally explicit
   ecological models are those focussed on biodiversity composition and
   those focussed on ecosystem function. These modelling disciplines are
   largely practiced separately, with separate literature, despite growing
   evidence that natural systems are shaped by the interaction of
   composition and function. Here we call for the development of new
   modelling approaches that integrate composition and function, accounting
   for the important interactions between these two dimensions,
   particularly under rapid global change. We examine existing modelling
   approaches that have begun to combine elements of composition and
   function, identifying their potential contribution to fully integrated
   modelling approaches. The development and application of integrated
   models of composition and function face a number of important
   challenges, including biological data limitations, system knowledge and
   computational constraints. We suggest a range of promising avenues that
   could help researchers overcome these challenges, including the use of
   virtual species, macro-ecological relationships and hybrid
   correlative-mechanistic modelling. Explicitly accounting for the

Abstract = {{AimGlobal environmental changes challenge traditional conservation
   approaches based on the selection of static protected areas due to their
   limited ability to deal with the dynamic nature of driving forces
   relevant to biodiversity. The Natura 2000 network (N2000) constitutes a
   major milestone in biodiversity conservation in Europe, but the degree
   to which this static network will be able to reach its long-term
   conservation objectives raises concern. We assessed the changes in the
   effectiveness of N2000 in a Mediterranean ecosystem between 2000 and
   2050 under different combinations of climate and land cover change
   scenarios.
   LocationCatalonia, Spain.
   MethodsPotential distribution changes of several terrestrial bird
   species of conservation interest included in the European Union's Birds
   Directive were predicted within an ensemble-forecasting framework that
   hierarchically integrated climate change and land cover change
   scenarios. Land cover changes were simulated using a spatially explicit
   fire-succession model that integrates fire management strategies and
   vegetation encroachment after the abandonment of cultivated areas as the
   main drivers of landscape dynamics in Mediterranean ecosystems.
   ResultsOur results suggest that the amount of suitable habitats for the
   target species will strongly decrease both inside and outside N2000.
   However, the effectiveness of N2000 is expected to increase in the next
   decades because the amount of suitable habitats is predicted to decrease
   less inside than outside this network.
   Main conclusionsSuch predictions shed light on the key role that the
   current N2000may play in the near future and emphasize the need for an
   integrative conservation perspective wherein agricultural, forest and
   fire management policies should be considered to effectively preserve
   key habitats for threatened birds in fire-prone, highly dynamic
   Mediterranean ecosystems. Results also show the importance of
   considering landscape dynamics and the synergies between different

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{12-24}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The need for rigorous analyses of climate impacts has never been more
   crucial. Current textbooks state that climate directly influences
   ecosystem annual net primary productivity (NPP), emphasizing the urgent
   need to monitor the impacts of climate change. A recent paper challenged
   this consensus, arguing, based on an analysis of NPP for 1247 woody
   plant communities across global climate gradients, that temperature and
   precipitation have negligible direct effects on NPP and only perhaps
   have indirect effects by constraining total stand biomass (M-tot) and
   stand age (a). The authors of that study concluded that the length of
   the growing season (l(gs)) might have a minor influence on NPP, an
   effect they considered not to be directly related to climate. In this
   article, we describe flaws that affected that study's conclusions and
   present novel analyses to disentangle the effects of stand variables and
   climate in determining NPP. We re-analyzed the same database to
   partition the direct and indirect effects of climate on NPP, using three
   approaches: maximum-likelihood model selection, independent-effects
   analysis, and structural equation modeling. These new analyses showed
   that about half of the global variation in NPP could be explained by
   M-tot combined with climate variables and supported strong and direct
   influences of climate independently of M-tot, both for NPP and for net
   biomass change averaged across the known lifetime of the stands
   (ABC=average biomass change). We show that l(gs) is an important climate
   variable, intrinsically correlated with, and contributing to mean annual
   temperature and precipitation (T-ann and P-ann), all important climatic
   drivers of NPP. Our analyses provide guidance for statistical and
   mechanistic analyses of climate drivers of ecosystem processes for
   predictive modeling and provide novel evidence supporting the strong,
   direct role of climate in determining vegetation productivity at the

Abstract = {{Understanding the process of adaptation during rapid environmental

   The recently formed White Sands system of southern New Mexico offers an
   outstanding example of rapid adaptation, with a variety of species
   having rapidly evolved blanched forms on the dunes that contrast with
   their close relatives in the surrounding dark soil habitat. In this
   study, we focus on two of the White Sands lizard species, Sceloporus
   cowlesi and Aspidoscelis inornata, for which previous research has
   linked mutations in the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (Mc1r) to blanched
   coloration. We sampled populations both on and off the dunes and used a
   custom sequence capture assay based on probed fosmid libraries to obtain
   >50kb of sequence around Mc1r and hundreds of other random genomic
   locations. We then used model-based statistical inference methods to
   describe the demographic and adaptive history characterizing the
   colonization of White Sands. We identified a number of similarities
   between the two focal species, including strong evidence of selection in
   the blanched populations in the Mc1r region. We also found important
   differences between the species, suggesting different colonization
   times, different genetic architecture underlying the blanched phenotype
   and different ages of the beneficial alleles. Finally, the beneficial
   allele is dominant in S.cowlesi and recessive in A.inornata, allowing
   for a rare empirical test of theoretically expected patterns of
   selective sweeps under these differing models.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems is limited by
   the complexity of the couplings between biosphere and atmosphere-what we
   define here as eco-climate. Critical transitions in ecosystem function
   and structure must be conceptualized, modeled, and ultimately predicted.
   Eco-climate system macrostate is a pattern of physical couplings between
   subsystems; each macrostate must be modeled differently because
   different physical processes are important. Critical transitions are
   less likely where the elasticity of macrostate is weak or absent. This
   motivates a fundamentally new complex systems approach.
   To model eco-climate macrostate, and its elasticity to seasonal climate
   forcing (air temperature and precipitation) and ecosystem biophysical
   state (phenophase).
   This Dynamical Process Network approach uses information flow to model
   an eco-climate system structure using timeseries observations from seven
   eddy-covariance tower sites in the United States. An aggregate power-law
   model estimates the elasticity of each location's macrostate to seasonal
   climate and phenophase.
   Macrostate varies by both season and ecosystem type. Evergreen forests
   are highly elastic to air temperature and are more likely than
   agricultural or deciduous systems to experience state changes as the
   climate warms. Precipitation and phenophase elasticity is stronger in
   some agricultural, grassland, and deciduous forest systems.
   Different empirical model structures are needed based on season and
   location, to simulate ecosystem carbon dynamics and critical state
   transitions. Phenophase directly controls macrostate in some ecosystems.
   Flux data co-located with in situ ecological monitoring are essential
   for eco-climate model development and prediction using complex systems
   approaches.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Farmland birds are important indicators of the state of biodiversity in
   rural landscapes, and the occurrence and abundance of birds contribute
   to their importance as bioindicators. However, the measurement of
   farmland bird abundance can be difficult. The rapid growth of crop
   plants in the spring combined with disturbances related to farming
   practices, such as weed and pest control and other measures, can
   profoundly change the habitat suitability of arable fields for birds
   within a short period of time. Consequently, the existing dynamics must
   be incorporated into the applied methods, and a single value of bird
   abundance during the breeding season is insufficient to characterise the
   habitat functions of arable land. The abundance of farmland bird species
   is influenced by crop specific features, which profoundly change within
   the breeding season and which we have described using a novel concept
   called Moving Window Abundance. Based on field surveys in 29 observation
   areas within arable landscapes, each 1 km(2), Skylark with territorial
   behaviour were counted using a mapping method related to the habitats
   and growth of field crops, such as wheat and maize. To describe the
   dynamic characteristics of the abundance during the breeding season over
   the time period from 16 March to 18 July, three methods of Moving Window
   Abundance were tested: patchy, adjacent and overlapping. These methods
   differ in the time-space continuity of the considered time window
   throughout the breeding season. In the Patchy Moving Window Abundance
   method, we used the exact days in which field surveys were conducted
   throughout the entire time period of the field surveys. However, with
   the Adjacent Moving Window Abundance method, the time window included
   five-day, ten-day and semi-monthly adjacent windows; in the Overlapping
   Moving Window Abundance method, the time window shifted daily, with
   five-day, ten-day and semi-monthly overlapping windows used in the
   calculation procedure. The results indicated that the dynamic nature of
   Skylark abundance (i) reached a maximum level in the first breeding
   period in the agricultural landscape and (ii) exhibited large variations
   in level and time within the various field crops. Therefore, abundance
   was not described conventionally using a single numerical value but
   rather using mathematical functions based on the spatial scale of the
   landscape and habitat. We conclude with recommendations for further
   research to standardise farmland bird monitoring. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   Pitfall vs. quadrat sampling}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{358-366}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We compared the two most commonly used sampling methods, pitfall
   trapping and quadrat sieving, to study community diversity and talitrid
   abundance on sandy beaches. They are both widely used methods, however
   they are related to different behaviors: surface activity (pitfall
   traps) and burrowing in the substrate (quadrat sieving). To detect bias
   intrinsically generated by the use of different sampling methods, we
   applied both methods on a set of five beaches in New South Wales,
   Australia. The set included non-contiguous beaches, exposed and
   sheltered, more or less affected by recreational use. The results
   indicated a high fluctuation in biodiversity features. However, the most
   human-frequented beaches were grouped together by Multi Dimensional
   Scaling, and substrate-modifiers talitrid amphipods (sand-hoppers),
   played a major role in this scaling. The analysis of similarities
   (ANOSIM) indicated the roles of exposure and human recreational use in
   shaping the community, while the methods (quadrats vs. traps) resulted
   in higher fluctuation within samples than between, and informative
   outliers. Generalized Linear Models developed to estimate the
   probability of capture of talitrids by sampling method pointed to a
   higher probability to capture both sand-hoppers and beach-hoppers with
   the quadrat method. We finally suggest: (1) the comparative use of both
   sampling methods whenever possible, to capture multiple information and
   avoid bias in biodiversity estimates; and (2) an ad-hoc strategy when
   dealing with target populations. In particular, attention should be paid
   when targeting co-occurring talitrid species characterized by different
   ecology and behavioral traits: sand-hoppers (substrate modifiers)
   appeared to be more sensitive than beach-hoppers (non-substrate
   modifiers) to the impacts considered. In terms of biodiversity
   assessment the methods were equal, but for talitrid sampling quadrat
   sieving was more efficient. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decades, sustainable development has been one of the key
   guiding principles in the European Union policies. It is based on a
   three-pillar framework - economic development, social development and
   environmental protection - that are interdependent and mutually
   reinforcing. As energy appears to be the cornerstone of economic growth,
   Europe 2020 strategy emphasizes the importance to make European Union
   more sustainable by means of the establishment of a long-term approach
   with a clear guidance to climate change. However, empirical literature
   about methods to elaborate SD indexes is scarce. Therefore, the
   objective of this paper is to obtain a Synthetic Index of Energy
   Sustainable Development for EU-15. Based on 33 variables, three indexes
   are calculated related to energy security of supply, competitive energy
   market and environmental protection dimensions which are later
   aggregated into a Synthetic Index. Our results show that Denmark, the
   Netherlands, France, Portugal and UK have the better scores. The success
   of these member states is given by the development of a suitable
   management in their energy policies regarding the reduction of their
   energy dependency, the increase of competitiveness in their energy
   markets and the establishment of measures to increase climate change
   protection. New reinforcing policies are necessary in intermediate
   member states based on new energy saving actions (in the cases of
   Sweden, Austria and Finland), the introduction of more competition in
   its energy market (in the case of Italy) and environment protection
   actions (in the case of Germany). Greater efforts are necessary in
   member states that have the worst results (Spain, Ireland, Greece,
   Belgium and Luxembourg). EU's budget support should be available for
   these member states in order to develop new and more effective actions
   that allow them to secure access to importations of energy sources under
   the best possible conditions while supplying energy at competitive
   prices and protecting the environment. It requires better coordination
   of national energy policies and greater cooperation between member
   states. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   seafood}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{1091-1103}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Human activities create more reactive nitrogen than is created through
   natural processes every year. The excess reactive nitrogen in the
   environment causes various negative effects including eutrophication,
   climate change, acidification, and human health problems. The sources of
   the excess nitrogen are mainly fertilizers and animal and human waste
   generated by food production and consumption. Therefore, our food
   choices have major effects on the nitrogen load to the environment. To
   quantify the load, a consumption-based accounting tool, called the
   nitrogen footprint, has been recently developed. In current nitrogen
   footprint models, seafood is calculated as a single category using the
   same simple assumptions as livestock. However, there is a variety of
   types and methods of production of seafood. In addition, world per
   capita consumption of seafood is projected to continue expanding. In
   this paper, we propose a new nitrogen footprint model to evaluate the
   impact of seafood in detail, present the results of the model applied to
   Japan as a case study, and explain the important parameters that are
   needed to accurately evaluate the load of seafood consumption. Our model
   tracks the feeding steps in detail, considering differences among fed
   aquacultured seafood, non-fed aquacultured seafood (mainly bivalves and
   filter-feeding carp), and captured seafood. Our model evaluates the
   Japanese food nitrogen footprint of fed aquacultured seafood as 0.7
   kg-N/capita/year, ca. 45\% of that of all seafood, whereas the previous
   model evaluates it as 3.36 kg-N/capita/year. Our results demonstrate
   that the key factors for assessing the nitrogen load of seafood are the
   proportions of fed aquaculture and of plant protein in feed. In order to
   enable food choices that will effectively reduce nitrogen release, we
   provide the virtual N factors (per intake nitrogen release during
   production) for different seafood as 0.2 (non-fed aquacultured and
   captured), 4.8 (freshwater and diadromous fish), 3.9 (demersal fish),
   3.4 (pelagic fish and other marine fish), and 8.2 (crustaceans). Our
   results show that eating more non-fed aquacultured and captured seafood
   and less fed-aquacultured shrimps and prawns could reduce our nitrogen
   load from food consumption as effectively as choosing poultry instead of
   beef. Although its evaluation is limited to nitrogen load related to
   food itself and not including the load from energy use, etc., our
   detailed nitrogen footprint model for different seafood categories and
   production sources can quantify the effectiveness of policies and
   actions that link sustainable consumption and sustainable fisheries and
   aquaculture, contributing toward the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. (C)

Abstract = {{Seagrasses are one of the most valuable marine ecosystems on earth, yet
   they are declining worldwide at alarming rates. With most of seagrass
   monitoring based on long term responses to environmental pressures,
   there is growing interest in developing alternative diagnostic tools
   that more effectively identify changes in seagrass ecological status at
   an early stage. Besides morphological indicators, functional and
   biochemical descriptors may provide a good understanding of plant's
   responses to environmental changes. Moreover, the epiphytic microbial
   communities of seagrasses may also shift in response to changes in
   environmental conditions, although these have been seldom used as a
   descriptor of environmental change. In this study three Halophila
   stipulacea (Forsk.) Aschers meadows, found in the Gulf of Aqaba
   (northern Red Sea), were characterized using an integrated approach to
   highlight possible differences in the meadows ecological status. Plant
   descriptors, including leaves morphometrics (leaf size, leaf
   number/plant, leaves with lost apex), photosynthetic pigments
   (Chlorophylls, Carotenoids) and total phenols contents, were
   investigated and coupled with the plants' epiphytic microbial community
   structure and composition, studied using pyrosequencing. The entire
   suite of descriptors highlighted differences among the meadows
   ecological status based on changes in plants' morphology and
   biochemistry, and their associated microbial communities, in response to
   the different environmental conditions (water column turbidity, seawater
   and sediment nutrients) and the geomorphological features (bottom slope,
   granulometry) of the stations. Leaf morphology and photosynthetic
   pigment content were modulated in H. stipulacea in response to light
   availability and hydrodynamics in the Gulf of Aqaba. The highest leaf
   surface area and photosynthetic pigment contents were observed at the
   lowest irradiance and hydrodynamics/granulometry among stations. Total
   phenol content showed differences among stations with increasing
   concentrations from north to south. The microbial communities showed
   differences among stations and plant compartments, with high incidence
   of Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in light limiting conditions,
   while Cyanobacteria and Rhodobacteraceae thrived in conditions of high
   light availability and hydrodynamics. The mutual response of the
   seagrass plants and the microbial communities provided evidence of their
   functional relationship, which undoubtedly needs further investigation.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such
   descriptors have been used in an integrated approach. We provide
   evidence of their effectiveness in discriminating seagrass ecological
   status, even at small spatial scales. This work constitutes a new
   approach to the assessment of seagrasses and a stepping stone in the
   application of microbial communities as a putative marker in a changing
   environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Member States of the European Union have committed to the
   maintenance and protection of forest lands. More precisely, the Member
   States aim to ensure the sustainable development and management of the
   EU's forests. For 2013, Eurostat's statistics about primary and
   secondary wood products in the European forest land (65\% thereof
   privately owned) estimate a roundwood production of 435 million m(3) in
   total. Harmonised information, i.e., spatially and temporarily
   differentiated, on forestry and wood harvesting activities in the
   European forests are missing however. This lack of information impedes
   the scientific assessment of the impacts that forest management
   practices have on the soil-related forest ecosystems (e.g., accelerated
   water soil erosion, delivery of inert sediments and pollutants within
   the drainage network, pauperization of aquatic ecosystems). It also
   prevents national and European institutions from taking measures aimed
   at an effective mitigation of the rapidly advancing land degradation.
   This study provides a first pan-European analysis that delineates the
   spatial patterns of forest cover changes in 36 countries. The first
   dynamic assessment of the soil loss potential in the EU-28 forests is
   reported. The recently published High-resolution Global Forest Cover
   Loss map (2000-2012) was reprocessed and validated. Results show that
   the map is a powerful tool to spatiotemporally indicate the forest
   sectors that are exposed to cover change risks. The accuracy assessment
   performed by using a confusion matrix based on 2300 reference forest
   disturbances distributed across Europe shows values of 55.1\% (producer
   accuracy) for the algorithm-derived forest cover change areas with a
   Kappa Index of Agreement (KIA) of 0.672. New insights into the
   distribution of the forest disturbance in Europe and the resulting soil
   loss potential were obtained. The presented maps provide spatially
   explicit indicators to assess the human-induced impacts of land cover
   changes and soil losses on the European soil-related forest ecosystems.
   These insights are relevant (i) to support policy making and land
   management decisions to ensure a sustainable forest management strategy
   and (ii) to provide a solid basis for further spatiotemporal
   investigations of the forestry practices' impacts on the European forest

   The diversity of organisms is being commonly accessed using

   New information
   In alignment-based taxonomy assignment approach, reliable identification
   of anonymous OTUs to supraspecific taxa depends on the correct
   application of similarity thresholds. Since various taxa show different
   level of genetic variation, practical application of alignment-based

Title = {{Human Effects in Holocene Fire Dynamics of Central Western Patagonia
   (similar to 44 degrees S, Chile)}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The forest-steppe ecotone of the eastern slope of the Andes in Central
   Western Patagonia (43 degrees 40'-49 degrees 15'S. Chile, South America)
   provides a unique area for assessing long and short term dynamics
   between humans and past environments. Central Western Patagonia was a
   demographically marginal zone inhabited intermittently and with low
   intensity by hunter-gatherers during the Holocene. This paper adopts a
   novel approach in order to assess the relationship between trends in the
   archeological, pollen, and charcoal records. The recognition of temporal
   and spatial scales in both archeology and paleoecology is crucial for
   defining roles in paleofire records. The main goal of the paper is to
   assess the role of climate and human beings as potential ignitors of
   wildfires by acknowledging the scales in which they operate and the
   different roles either one played in paleofire trends. We investigated a
   case study in the Cisnes River Valley (CRV) where the frequencies and
   magnitudes of fire episodes-reconstructed from macro-charcoal particles
   from the Lake Shaman intermoraine sequence-can be attributed to human
   action, while acknowledging the driving role of climate over broader
   time scales. The Lake Shaman charcoal record spanning the last 19,000
   cal years is compared to the archeological record starting at 11,500 cal
   years BR After comparing paleofires, reconstructed from the charcoal
   record, with peaks and troughs in the radiocarbon record and
   archeological evidence at local and site scales, we argue that this
   approach provides insights for assessing the timing and magnitude of
   human effects on the environment. We examine collation and correlation
   scenarios for comparative trends between the archeological, pollen, and
   charcoal records. The correlation of occupational events at the El
   Chueco 1 archeological site and other sites along the CRV with the
   results obtained at Lake Shaman is suggestive of a combination of human
   agency and climate drivers in the occurrence of fires during most of the
   Holocene.}},

Abstract = {{Classifying communities into urban and rural is essential in the
   governmental and institutional decision making process. However, the
   notion of urban and rural varies from one country to another. Some
   nations classify settlements into urban and rural according to a
   population threshold, others according to prevailing professions in the
   community and another method is from a social aspect. The Egyptian
   State's method to classify urban and rural communities depends on the
   Ministry of Interior (MoI) decrees based primarily on population numbers
   along with other factors like the existence of certain land uses. Within
   this context, the research pinpointed some ambiguous facts related to
   that classification. Hence, the current study is pursuing a new method
   to address this issue. This is to be done by constructing a composite
   index (CI) that ranges from 0-1 with a threshold value of 0.5 where the
   lower values are considered rural and the higher are inferred to as
   urban. The research followed the OECD method to construct the index. The
   analytical study is carried out on 6 governorates and the data entry for
   the 34 utilized indicators is made on 459 ``sheiakha{''} which is the
   smallest administrative unit to collect data upon. Data entry and the
   construction of the index along with its validation is done using SPSS.
   The CI results ranges from 0.27 to 0.76 with a cut-off value of 0.56.
   Accordingly, all ``sheiakha{''} are reclassified and cross-compared to
   the existing classification. Furthermore, spatial analysis of the index
   outcomes, using ArcGIS-ArcInfo, shows that high/low levels of
   urbanization cluster together with no sharp cutting edge, but rather a
   piecemeal decrease in urbanization level from the centre of the urban
   cluster to the outer suburbs.}},

Title = {{Integrating precipitation, grazing, past effects and interactions in
   long-term vegetation change}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{111-117}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Determining the causes of vegetation change in arid and semi-arid
   environments can be difficult and may involve multiple factors,
   including disturbance, inter-annual climatic variation, soils, effects
   from years past and interactions between these factors. Theoretical
   models describing vegetation change in these systems have generally
   focused on a single aspect as the primary driver. The integration of
   these factors into a single model may be what is required to fully
   understand the drivers of vegetation change in desert systems. To test
   the contributions of these various factors, we analyzed a long-term
   (1979-2011) vegetation dataset using multiple linear regression.
   While precipitation and livestock density were important variables for
   explaining vegetation change, the consistency with which past effects
   and interactions significantly improved the models underscores their
   importance. Past effects were included in every model except for shrub
   diversity, and included both precipitation and livestock density
   effects. A novel approach to addressing the interaction between grazing
   and precipitation was included by dividing precipitation by stocking
   density. Grass density had a high positive correlation with this metric,
   while shrub cover had a small negative correlation. These results
   support the integration of multiple factors to explain vegetation
   change. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of ecological network or other continuous habitat is
   essential for urban eco-system; however, to quantify the heterogeneous
   functional connectivity for eco-network is academically attractive and
   challenging. The dynamic lines of space syntax, tenable to simulate
   perception and navigation flows in network-configured human settlements,
   is introduced to inspire idea and approach to modeling connectivity in
   eco-network, while the classical graphic notions and variables are
   assumed functional to new relationship between other species and
   eco-network. After mapping continuous functional components among land
   layout into free space and then into dynamic lines that influence
   bio-flows, the paper conducts an exploration on functional connectivity
   of Singapore's green network. Conclusions involves the distribution
   heterogeneity of basic variables, Connectivity, Control, Mean Depth and
   Integration, demonstrating each meaning for functional connectivity in
   the network, with a step-wise Integration further comparing the
   connectivity patterns under different behavioral ranges. Moreover, a
   scale robustness determined via linear regression between Integration
   and Connectivity reveals network functionality as behavioral scale
   varying. The analogical modeling of space syntax raised in this paper is
   adaptive and instructive, particularly if original essential traits
   remain valid between the substituted species and space, because several
   principles and characteristics of conventional connectivity models can
   be logically inherited, while the graphic notions of dynamic line shares
   unique advantages. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Defoliation effects of Diorhabda carinulata on tamarisk

Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Diorhabda carinulata (northern tamarisk beetle) has been released in the
   western United States as a biological control agent for the invasive
   plant Tamarix spp. (tamarisk). A few studies have been conducted
   analysing the effects of beetle defoliation on tamarisk water
   consumption, but predefoliation and post-defoliation comparison based on
   field data is scarce. The question of whether beetles substantially
   alter tamarisk water consumption is still open for discussion. In this
   study, an eddy covariance station and groundwater monitoring well were
   installed in a tamarisk stand along the Virgin River near Mesquite, NV,
   in 2010 to observe the impacts of tamarisk defoliation on
   evapotranspiration (ET) and groundwater levels. ET was calculated using
   the eddy covariance method and the White method and supported by Landsat
   remote sensing estimates. Data collected in 2010 established a baseline
   since the beetles arrived at the site in late 2010 and started feeding
   on foliage causing tamarisk trees to turn to brown during 2011. Repeated
   defoliations in 2011 and 2012 show that post-defoliation ET values and
   magnitude of diurnal groundwater-level fluctuations decreased compared
   with the predefoliation values. Estimated annual ET and annual average
   daily groundwater fluctuations were reduced by 18\% and 35\%,
   respectively. However, the magnitude of effects of defoliation was
   dependent on the growth stage of tamarisk at the time of defoliation.
   Also, ET recovered within a month as tamarisk established new leaves.
   Results from this study suggest that long-term changes in ET are highly
   dependent on repeated defoliation occurrences over several years.

Abstract = {{Intensive deer management (IDM) is fundamentally changing how one of the
   most important game species in North America is being managed, but
   little is known about how wildlife conservation professionals view these
   changes. The IDM approach encourages privatization of deer (Odocoileus
   spp.) through practices including feeding, high fencing, artificial
   insemination and markets in deer semen, and translocation. To evaluate
   support for IDM practices, we surveyed 208 registrants of the 2010
   Southeast Deer Study Group Meeting held in San Antonio, Texas, USA.
   Specifically, we evaluated support for IDM practices using state-agency
   wildlife biologists, private wildlife managers, and academics, and we
   evaluated how geographic region and employment type are related to
   opinions about IDM. Using Principal Components Analysis, we created 3
   new scales that measured respondents' opinions about deer management,
   deer husbandry, and deer hunting. We detected strong opposition to IDM
   among respondents, with respondents from universities having the
   strongest opposition, followed by state-agency employees from Texas, and
   private consultants from Texas (the latter having the greatest support
   for IDM). Our study highlights the need for critical and empirical
   evaluation of the articulation between IDM and the North American Model
   of Wildlife Conservation, particularly the tenets that assert wildlife
   are held in the public trust and advocate elimination of markets for
   wildlife. (C) 2015 The Wildlife Society.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many species are expanding their range polewards, and this has been
   associated with rapid phenotypic change. Yet, it is unclear to what
   extent this reflects rapid genetic adaptation or neutral processes
   associated with range expansion, or selection linked to the new thermal
   conditions encountered. To disentangle these alternatives, we studied
   the genomic signature of range expansion in the damselfly Coenagrion
   scitulum using 4950 newly developed genomic SNPs and linked this to the
   rapidly evolved phenotypic differences between core and (newly
   established) edge populations. Most edge populations were genetically
   clearly differentiated from the core populations and all were
   differentiated from each other indicating independent range expansion
   events. In addition, evidence for genetic drift in the edge populations,
   and strong evidence for adaptive genetic variation in association with
   the range expansion was detected. We identified one SNP under consistent
   selection in four of the five edge populations and showed that the
   allele increasing in frequency is associated with increased flight
   performance. This indicates collateral, non-neutral evolutionary changes
   in independent edge populations driven by the range expansion process.
   We also detected a genomic signature of adaptation to the newly
   encountered thermal regimes, reflecting a pattern of countergradient
   variation. The latter signature was identified at a single SNP as well
   as in a set of covarying SNPs using a polygenic multilocus approach to
   detect selection. Overall, this study highlights how a strategic
   geographic sampling design and the integration of genomic, phenotypic
   and environmental data can identify and disentangle the neutral and
   adaptive processes that are simultaneously operating during range
   expansions.}},

Title = {{Thresholds in the relationship between functional diversity and patch

Journal = {{ANIMAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{499-511}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Patch size affects abundance and diversity of mammal species, but there
   is little information on threshold regarding this relationship or
   relating it to functional diversity. Therefore, we aimed with this study
   to (1) evaluate if the functional diversity of medium-and large-sized
   mammal assemblages can be explained by patch size; (2) if this
   relationship is positive, evaluate whether it is linear (neutral
   hypothesis) or has critical thresholds (threshold hypothesis); (3)
   propose specific conservation strategies for each situation. We used
   primary and secondary mammal database for different forest remnants
   sizes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. We calculated functional
   diversity (FD), using an ecologically meaningful set of traits: body
   mass and locomotion form, behavioral and dietary traits, and
   environmental sensitivity of species. We compared linear models with
   threshold models using Akaike information criterion (AIC). FD values
   increased with patch size, possibly associated with the high complexity
   and heterogeneity of larger areas. The threshold model better explained
   the pattern between FD values and patch sizes than the linear one (delta
   AIC = 35.8), confirming our threshold hypothesis. Two thresholds (at 60
   and 2050 ha) were identified. Our results highlight the need of
   compliance with the Brazilian Forest Code for assemblages in fragments
   lower than 60 ha. For assemblages in fragments between the two
   thresholds whose FD values significantly increased with patch size, we
   recommend improvements in conservation planning. For assemblages in
   fragments bigger than 2050 ha, we suggest the establishment of new
   protected areas, or at least, the maintenance of the existent ones. Our
   approach can serve as the basis for analysis with other taxonomic groups
   and ecosystems, increasing chances of maintaining faunal ecological
   functions, and improving species conservation.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim The aim of this study was to test different modelling approaches,
   including a new framework, for predicting the spatial distribution of
   richness and composition of two insect groups.
   Location The western Swiss Alps. Methods We compared two community
   modelling approaches: the classical method of stacking binary prediction
   obtained from individual species distribution models (binary stacked
   species distribution models, bS-SDMs), and various implementations of a
   recent framework (spatially explicit species assemblage modelling,
   SESAM) based on four steps that integrate the different drivers of the
   assembly process in a unique modelling procedure. We used: (1) five
   methods to create bS-SDM predictions; (2) two approaches for predicting
   species richness, by summing individual SDM probabilities or by
   modelling the number of species (i.e. richness) directly; and (3) five
   different biotic rules based either on ranking probabilities from SDMs
   or on community co-occurrencepatterns. Combining these various options
   resulted in 47 implementations for each taxon.
   Results Species richness of the two taxonomic groups was predicted with
   good accuracy overall, and in most cases bS-SDM did not produce a biased
   prediction exceeding the actual number of species in each unit. In the
   prediction of community composition bS-SDM often also yielded the best
   evaluation score. In the case of poor performance of bS-SDM (i.e. when
   bS-SDM overestimated the prediction of richness) the SESAM framework
   improved predictions of species composition.
   Main conclusions Our results differed from previous findings using
   community-level models. First, we show that overprediction of richness
   by bS-SDM is not a general rule, thus highlighting the relevance of
   producing good individual SDMs to capture the ecological filters that
   are important for the assembly process. Second, we confirm the potential
   of SESAM when richness is overpredicted by bS-SDM; limiting the number
   of species for each unit and applying biotic rules (here using the
   ranking of SDM probabilities) can improve predictions of species
   composition.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The role of theory within ecology has changed dramatically in recent
   decades. Once primarily a source of qualitative conceptual framing,
   ecological theories and models are now often used to develop
   quantitative explanations of empirical patterns and to project future
   dynamics of specific ecological systems. In this essay, I recount my own
   experience of this transformation, in which accelerating computing power
   and the widespread incorporation of stochastic processes into ecological
   theory combined to create some novel integration of mathematical and
   statistical models. This stronger integration drives theory towards
   incorporating more biological realism, and I explore ways in which we
   can grapple with that realism to generate new general theoretical
   insights. This enhanced realism, in turn, may lead to frameworks for
   projecting ecological responses to anthropogenic change, which is,
   arguably, the central challenge for 21st-century ecology. In an era of
   big data and synthesis, ecologists are increasingly seeking to infer
   causality from observational data; but conventional biometry provides
   few tools for this project. This is a realm where theorists can and
   should play an important role, and I close by pointing towards some
   analytical and philosophical approaches developed in our sister
   discipline of economics that address this very problem. While I make no
   grand prognostications about the likely discoveries of ecological theory
   over the coming century, you will find in this essay a scattering of
   more or less far-fetched ideas that I, at least, think are interesting
   and (possibly) fruitful directions for our field.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Plant invasions are an increasingly serious global concern, especially

   between native- and novel exotic-dominated grasslands with experimental
   addition of summer precipitation in Texas in 2009. Exotic species
   greened up earlier than natives by an average of 18days. This was
   associated with a lower invasion rate early in the growing season
   compared to native communities. However, invasion rate did not differ
   significantly between native and exotic communities across all sampling
   times. The predictors of invasion rate differed between native and
   exotic communities, with invasion being negatively influenced by species
   richness in natives and by dominant species in exotics. Interestingly,
   plant invasions matched the bimodal pattern of precipitation in Temple,
   Texas, and did not respond to the pulse of precipitation during the
   summer. Our results suggest that we will need to take different
   approaches in understanding of invasion between native and exotic
   grasslands. Moreover, with anticipated increasing variability in
   precipitation under global climate change, plant invasions may be
   constrained in their response if the precipitation pulses fall outside

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Climate-driven variability of habitat selection of large herbivores has
   not yet been explicitly analyzed. To this end, we aimed to better
   understand the climate-ecological mechanisms behind geographic patterns
   of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) habitat utilization. Our study
   area comprised of the ranges of Filefjell Reinlag, southern Norway (60
   degrees 20'-61 degrees 20' N; 8 degrees 20'-9 degrees 50' E). We
   analyzed habitat selection of 20 (+/- 2) GPS-collared female reindeer
   over a period of five years. We examined the mechanistic forces of
   habitat selection variability by applying a novel stepwise factor
   analysis approach based on the niche concept. We characterized the
   governing conditions for inductively delineated seasons and extracted in
   a first step for each year the seasonal scores of the individual animals
   on the environmental variables to explain their habitat use. For each
   season, we then conducted principal component analyses (PCA) to analyze
   the inter-annual variability in habitat preferences using the individual
   scores for the environmental variables per year. In a third step, we fit
   our potential drivers as vectors onto each seasonal PCA and retained
   solely significant drivers. Our results reveal complex spatiotemporal
   patterns of habitat selection that are driven by seasonality,
   year-to-year climate variability, and the choice of individual animals.
   In contrast to expected similarities between conspecifics, our analyses
   revealed varying degrees of intraspecies variability and therefore
   suggest that responses of individual reindeer to climate variability are
   inconsistent. Moreover, we found annually reoccurring patterns of
   habitat selection strength during different seasons that help explain
   coping capacities of reindeer against climate variability. In contrast
   with our expectations, we detected a very high inter-annual variability
   in habitat preferences to be related to governing climatic conditions.
   Here, we present new evidence for the variability of response mechanisms
   of reindeer's habitat selection shown throughout different seasons and
   years that buffer alpine pastoralism against climate variability. Our
   work contributes to a better understanding of alpine ecological response
   mechanisms as a key for projections of future responses to climate

   behaviors from satellite telemetry data}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{While telemetry is an invaluable tool for tracking animal movement
   patterns, the data generated by this technique is often challenging to
   interpret. Here, we addressed this issue by developing a novel method,
   based on changepoint analysis, which incorporated both the horizontal
   and vertical movement metrics and compared this output to that from a
   switching state-space model (SSSM) that categorized behavior based on
   horizontal movement metrics. We deployed 20 satellite transmitters on
   postnesting loggerhead turtles at Rethymno, Crete, Greece between 2010
   and 2011 to monitor their at-sea behavior. We used both models to
   identify behavioral changes, such as the switches from migration to
   foraging, and from foraging to overwintering. The satellite-tracked
   turtles exhibited three discrete migratory strategies, with 9 turtles
   migrating southwards to the coast of northern Africa, 6 turtles
   migrating northwards into the Aegean Sea, and 4 turtles remaining
   resident in the waters of Crete. The SSSM readily identified the switch
   from transiting to ARS behavior in most animals, but the CPA model was
   able to distinguish multiple modes and more subtle shifts in behavior
   corresponding with shifts from migration to foraging to overwintering
   behaviors. We have shown that by incorporating vertical movement metrics

Volume = {{120}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An ecological economics perspective on urban sustainability embraces a
   biophysical view which emphasizes the dependence of cities on vast
   quantities of natural capital from various sources and spatial scales,
   and the generation of urban wastes which impact the local, regional and
   global systems. In recent years, several sets of urban sustainability
   indicators and indices have been developed. However, only a few consider
   the complex multi-scale interactions between the urban activities and
   the environment. Furthermore, most existing indices use a relative
   evaluation approach instead of an absolute approach that is needed when
   dealing with ecological thresholds. The paper introduces a new urban
   biophysical sustainability index whose framework includes: the city
   environmental quality, use of natural resources, and GHG emissions. Each
   contains topics for assessment related to local, regional and global
   scales and associated indicators. Standard and optimum values were
   determined for each indicator and a formula is provided for grading each
   indicator measurement. The integration of those grades allows for
   generation of a compound score of each topic, category, spatial scale
   and the entire urban biophysical sustainability performance. It then
   demonstrates the index in three major Israeli cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Functional trait-based ecological research has been instrumental in
   advancing our understanding of natural plant community dynamics.
   However, to date, principles of functional trait ecology have not been
   widely applied to agricultural research and management. Here, we discuss
   why and how a functional trait approach - distinct from a traditional
   agronomic trait approach that focuses strictly on crop yield components
   - can provide a valuable framework for agricultural research. We
   illustrate these points with an emphasis on commodity crops. The
   literature suggests a key role for functional trait-based research in
   understanding the causes and consequences of changes in agroecosystem
   structure and function. This includes novel approaches to understanding
   crop breeding and productivity, agroecosystem dynamics and non-crop
   biodiversity maintenance, the contributions of agroecosystems to global
   net primary productivity and other biogeochemical cycles, and
   agricultural vulnerability to climate change. We propose that a key step
   in advancing trait-based agricultural research is the consolidation of
   functional trait data for the world's most common crop and fodder
   species, the main commodities on approximate to 12 billion ha of land.
   Using Coffea arabica as an example, we show there is strong potential to
   populate a comprehensive data base of crop functional trait data. For
   C.arabica, there exist hundreds of observations for ecologically
   important leaf economics' and root economics' traits, either in smaller
   data bases or peer-reviewed studies, but these have not been
   consolidated. A similar opportunity for functional trait data
   consolidation exists for many of the world's most common crops.Synthesis
   and applications. A unified functional trait data base for just 65 of
   the world's most common agricultural crops can be used to provide
   baseline evaluations of the functional diversity across croplands
   covering approximate to 81\% of the Earth's land surface. This
   functional trait data, and other trait-based research, could further be
   used to evaluate how changes in interspecific and intraspecific crop
   diversity are mechanistically linked with alterations in agroecosystem
   function. Ultimately, trait-based research that examines the causes and
   consequences of agricultural homogenization may contribute to more
   ecologically informed management of agricultural diversity, from genetic
   through to global scales.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1588-1597}},

Abstract = {{Conservation goals are ideally set after a thorough understanding of
   potential threats; however, predicting future spatial patterns of
   threats, such as disturbance, remains challenging. Here, we develop a
   novel extension of network fortification-interdiction models (NFIM) that
   deals with uncertainty in future spatial patterns of disturbance by
   optimally selecting sites that will best mitigate a worst-case scenario
   for a given magnitude of disturbance. This approach uses information on
   between-patch movement probabilities and patch-specific survival, which
   can be estimated from mark-recapture data, to optimize life expectancy.
   Optimization occurs in three interrelated stages: protection, followed
   by disturbance and then assessment. We applied the modelling approach to
   two mark-recapture data sets: roseate terns Sterna dougallii in the
   north-eastern United States and the Everglade snail kite Rostrhamus
   sociabilis plumbeus in Florida. We contrasted the results to a more
   conventional approach of protecting sites that maximize connectivity (by
   minimizing the distances among protected sites) and a bi-objective model
   that maximizes connectivity and the number of individuals under
   protection. Protecting sites that best mitigate future worst-case
   disturbance scenarios consistently resulted in higher predicted life
   expectancies than protecting patches that minimize dispersal distance.
   Predicted life expectancy was similar between NFIM and the bi-objective
   model for the small roseate tern network, yet the NFIM predicted higher
   life expectancy than any of the scenarios in the bi-objective model in
   the snail kite network.Synthesis and applications. This application of
   interdiction models prescribed a combination of patches for protection
   that results in the least possible decrease in life expectancy. Our
   analyses of the snail kite and roseate tern networks suggest that
   managing to protect these prescribed patches by the network
   fortification -interdiction models (i.e. protecting against the
   worst-case disturbance scenario) is more beneficial than managing
   patches that minimize dispersal distance or maximize the number of
   individuals under protection if the conservation goal is to ensure the
   long-term persistence of a species.

Title = {{Tracking the origins and development of biodiversity offsetting in
   academic research and its implications for conservation: A review}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{192}},
Pages = {{492-503}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Spurred by recent initiatives aimed at achieving ``No Net Loss{''} of
   biodiversity, the concept of biodiversity offsetting (henceforth 130) is
   growing in popularity in the political, business, conservation and
   academic arenas. Promising to make economic development compatible with
   biodiversity conservation, BO mechanisms appear as the new tool for
   biodiversity conservation, and they are increasingly integrated into
   agendas and strategies to biodiversity. The concept has also become
   popular with scholars but it is still highly debated in particular its
   ecological consequences. Moreover, this recent enthusiasm for BO has led
   to confusion especially on its emergence and development in the academic
   sphere, and its implications for conservation. This article addresses
   these issues. It examines the origins, characteristics and dynamics of
   BO in academic output and highlights the main drivers of its
   development, to finally conclude on its implications for conservation
   practice. We carried out a systematic literature review based on
   thorough scientometric analyses of the scientific literature on BO
   recorded in the Web of Science database over the past three decades
   (1984-2014). Through the analysis of 477 articles we identified three
   stages in the development of the topic in academia, and highlighted the
   influence of specific countries, authors, research areas and articles.
   We found that non-academic institutions were particularly influential,
   notably environmental non-governmental organizations. Furthermore, we
   identified a major change in the past decade in the topics and lexicon
   related to BO, which has moved from ecologically-driven approaches to an
   economic and market lexicon. Overall, this review highlights the use of
   an economic rhetoric to frame the BO discourse resulting from political
   influence rather than an actual scientific progress in ecological or
   economic sciences. This trend seems aligned with a new movement in
   conservation aimed at using economic approaches to justify and achieve
   conservation goals. Caught in a strong normative current and supported
   by a specific view of nature, we argue that BO is not a neutral concept
   for conservation practice. We therefore advocate the wise and careful
   use of this mechanism in practice, and further research be carried out
   to examine the theoretical and practical dimensions of BO, and the
   ethical implications underlying its development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Coastal cliff erosion is a widespread problem that threatens property
   and infrastructure along many of the world's coastlines. Rates of
   erosion used for shoreline management are generally based on analysis of
   historic maps and aerial photographs which, in rocky coast environments,
   does not wholly capture the detail in the processes and the failures
   occurring across the cliff face. This study uses airborne LiDAR (Light
   Detection and Ranging) data to gain a quantitative understanding of
   cliff erosion along rocky coastline where recession rates are relatively
   low (c. 0.1 m yr(-1)).
   It was found that three-dimensional volumetric changes on the cliff face
   and linear rates of retreat can be reliably calculated from consecutive
   digital elevation models (DEMs) several years apart. Furthermore, the
   accuracy of the data on sloping surfaces was tested by applying a
   threshold below which data that could be construed as error were
   removed. Using a vertical change threshold of 0.5 m had limited effect
   on the computed rates of retreat. The spatial variability in recession
   rates around the coastline was considered in terms of the relationship
   with the varying boundary conditions (rock mass characteristics, cliff
   geometries, beach morphology) and forcing parameters (wave climate and
   wave exposure). Recession rates were statistically correlated with
   significant wave height (H (s) ), rock mass characteristics (GSI) and
   the ratio between the two (GSI/H (s) ).
   The current method of assessing rocky cliff recession using maps and
   aerial photographs tends to not only miss the detail in the
   three-dimensional nature of the cliff evolution, but may also be too
   coarse a resolution to capture the small scale changes that contribute
   to the overall failure. LiDAR data, although limited in its temporal
   extent due to it being a relatively new technology, is a suitable method
   of evaluating cliff erosion on a time scale of 3-4 years and provides
   additional insight into the process occurring in slowly eroding
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing concern over sea-level rise impacts to coastal tidal marsh
   ecosystems has led to modeling efforts to anticipate outcomes for
   resource management decision making. Few studies on the Pacific coast of
   North America have modeled sea-level rise marsh susceptibility at a
   scale relevant to local wildlife populations and plant communities.
   Here, we use a novel approach in developing an empirical sea-level rise
   ecological response model that can be applied to key management
   questions. Calculated elevation change over 13 y for a 324-ha portion of
   San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge, California, USA, was used to
   represent local accretion and subsidence processes. Next, we coupled
   detailed plant community and elevation surveys with measured rates of
   inundation frequency to model marsh state changes to 2100. By grouping
   plant communities into low, mid, and high marsh habitats, we were able
   to assess wildlife species vulnerability and to better understand
   outcomes for habitat resiliency. Starting study-site conditions were
   comprised of 78\% (253-ha) high marsh, 7\% (30-ha) mid marsh, and 4\%
   (18-ha) low marsh habitats, dominated by pickleweed Sarcocornia pacifica
   and cordgrass Spartina spp. Only under the low sea-level rise scenario
   (44 cm by 2100) did our models show persistence of some marsh habitats
   to 2100, with the area dominated by low marsh habitats. Under mid (93 cm
   by 2100) and high sea-level rise scenarios (166 cm by 2100), most mid
   and high marsh habitat was lost by 2070, with only 15\% (65 ha)
   remaining, and a complete loss of these habitats by 2080. Low marsh
   habitat increased temporarily under all three sea-level rise scenarios,
   with the peak (286 ha) in 2070, adding habitat for the endemic
   endangered California Ridgway's rail Rallus obsoletus obsoletus. Under
   mid and high sea-level rise scenarios, an almost complete conversion to
   mudflat occurred, with most of the area below mean sea level. Our
   modeling assumed no marsh migration upslope due to human levee and
   infrastructure preventing these types of processes. Other modeling
   efforts done for this area have projected marsh persistence to 2100, but
   our modeling effort with site-specific datasets allowed us to model at a
   finer resolution with much higher local confidence, resulting in
   different results for management. Our results suggest that projected
   sea-level rise will have significant impacts on marsh plant communities
   and obligate wildlife, including those already under federal and state
   protection. Comprehensive modeling as done here improves the potential
   to implement adaptive management strategies and prevent marsh habitat
   and wildlife loss in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The changing mode of urban development through time can bring a varied

   effects on tree communities. The study areas cover public housing

   Thirteen site factors related to estate, landform and habitat traits
   were measured or computed as surrogate urbanization effects. Species
   composition and diversity of tree communities in 102 estates were
   assessed by field surveys, including four estate groups: older or newer
   ones situated respectively in urban core or new towns. They contain
   48,823 trees belonging to 232 species with heavy exotic representation.
   Total tree density and native tree density in newer estates were
   significantly higher than older ones. Differences in species richness
   and diversity and native species richness between older and newer
   estates were not significant, expressing to a certain extent the
   floristic-homogenization phenomenon. Multi-response Permutation
   Procedures (MRPP) results showed significant difference in species
   composition between older and newer estates, which could be explained by
   variations in development age, density, town plan and pre-urbanization
   land cover. Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) results found tree
   distribution patterns in four estate groups strongly associated with
   estate area, open space area, estate population, estate age, Shannon

   Urban-forest management could be improved by adopting more native

   spatially explicit scenarios of future land-use changes, reflecting
   different land-use policies and changes in agricultural markets, to
   quantify and map potential drivers of novelty. Our results showed large
   areas where future land-use changes may increase novelty in ecosystems.
   The major land-use changes known to increase novelty, including land
   abandonment and land-use expansion, were widespread in all scenarios (73
   million to 95 million ha), especially in the eastern U.S. and along the
   West Coast. Our scenarios revealed that, at broad scales, future
   land-use changes will increase novelty in ecosystems, and that
   traditional conservation policies may have limited ability to prevent
   the process. In places such as the eastern U.S., conserving and
   maintaining historical conditions and associated biological diversity
   may become increasingly difficult due to future land-use changes and

Abstract = {{Modeling the distributions of species, especially of invasive species in
   non-native ranges, involves multiple challenges. Here, we developed some
   novel approaches to species distribution modeling aimed at reducing the
   influences of such challenges and improving the realism of projections.
   We estimated species-environment relationships for Parthenium
   hysterophorus L. (Asteraceae) with four modeling methods run with
   multiple scenarios of (i) sources of occurrences and geographically
   isolated background ranges for absences, (ii) approaches to drawing
   background (absence) points, and (iii) alternate sets of predictor
   variables. We further tested various quantitative metrics of model
   evaluation against biological insight. Model projections were very
   sensitive to the choice of training dataset. Model accuracy was much
   improved using a global dataset for model training, rather than
   restricting data input to the species' native range. AUC score was a
   poor metric for model evaluation and, if used alone, was not a useful
   criterion for assessing model performance. Projections away from the
   sampled space (i.e., into areas of potential future invasion) were very
   different depending on the modeling methods used, raising questions
   about the reliability of ensemble projections. Generalized linear models
   gave very unrealistic projections far away from the training region.
   Models that efficiently fit the dominant pattern, but exclude highly
   local patterns in the dataset and capture interactions as they appear in
   data (e.g., boosted regression trees), improved generalization of the
   models. Biological knowledge of the species and its distribution was
   important in refining choices about the best set of projections. A post
   hoc test conducted on a new Parthenium dataset from Nepal validated
   excellent predictive performance of our `best' model. We showed that
   vast stretches of currently uninvaded geographic areas on multiple
   continents harbor highly suitable habitats for parthenium. However,
   discrepancies between model predictions and parthenium invasion in
   Australia indicate successful management for this globally significant

Abstract = {{Variations in photosynthesis still cause substantial uncertainties in
   predicting photosynthetic CO2 uptake rates and monitoring plant stress.
   Changes in actual photosynthesis that are not related to greenness of
   vegetation are difficult to measure by reflectance based optical remote
   sensing techniques. Several activities are underway to evaluate the
   sun-induced fluorescence signal on the ground and on a coarse spatial
   scale using space-borne imaging spectrometers. Intermediate-scale
   observations using airborne-based imaging spectroscopy, which are
   critical to bridge the existing gap between small-scale field studies
   and global observations, are still insufficient. Here we present the
   first validated maps of sun-induced fluorescence in that critical,
   intermediate spatial resolution, employing the novel airborne imaging
   spectrometer HyPlant. HyPlant has an unprecedented spectral resolution,
   which allows for the first time quantifying sun-induced fluorescence
   fluxes in physical units according to the Fraunhofer Line Depth
   Principle that exploits solar and atmospheric absorption bands. Maps of
   sun-induced fluorescence show a large spatial variability between
   different vegetation types, which complement classical remote sensing
   approaches. Different crop types largely differ in emitting fluorescence
   that additionally changes within the seasonal cycle and thus may be
   related to the seasonal activation and deactivation of the
   photosynthetic machinery. We argue that sun-induced fluorescence
   emission is related to two processes: (i) the total absorbed radiation
   by photosynthetically active chlorophyll; and (ii) the functional status
   of actual photosynthesis and vegetation stress.}},

   important restoration plant in the arid southwestern United States, by
   analyzing variation at 153 amplified fragment length polymorphism loci
   in the context of environmental gradients separating 47 Mojave Desert

   loci with spatial gradients in temperature, precipitation, and
   topography. We identified non-linear thresholds in loci frequencies
   driven by summer maximum temperature and water stress, along with
   continuous variation corresponding to temperature seasonality. Two
   GDM-based approaches for mapping predicted patterns of local adaptation

Abstract = {{Extreme climatic events are a natural feature of climate variability and
   a major organising force in running waters. Climate change is shifting
   the occurrence of extremes, and understanding the far-reaching
   consequences for river and stream ecosystems is a research priority. The
   aim of this special issue is to unite research on the wide array of
   contrasting extreme events affecting river and stream ecosystems
   globally, including heat waves and hot days, fires, droughts, heavy
   rainfall and floods, tropical cyclones, storm surges and coastal
   flooding. This issue contains reviews as well as observational and
   experimental case studies that assess the ecological impacts of extreme
   events at multiple levels of biological organisation, from individuals
   to ecosystems and food webs, in river and stream ecosystems from the
   poles to the tropics. Together, these papers synthesise knowledge of
   extreme events and their effects, identify research gaps and propose new
   hypotheses and approaches to guide future research. The contributions
   reveal that impacts of single events such as catastrophic floods,
   droughts and heat waves are highly context dependent, ranging from
   deleterious to beneficial, and are contingent upon event magnitude,
   extent and timing relative to life cycles of constituent species. Not
   all extreme events generate extreme ecological impacts, but combinations
   of events that are cumulative, compound or cross key biological or
   physical thresholds may have the most adverse ecological consequences.
   Long-term monitoring programmes and sensor networks are essential in
   describing rare and usual events. Other approaches, including
   experiments, will be needed to gain a stronger mechanistic understanding
   of extreme events, and to predict and manage future events that may be
   more frequent and intense.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{473}},
Pages = {{176-187}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Increasing population pressure, urbanisation of the coastal zone and
   nutrient and sediment run-off from agriculture and forestry has
   increased the number of large-scale and chronic impacts affecting
   coastal and estuarine systems. The need to assess cumulative impacts is
   a major motivation for the current desire of managers and ecologists to
   define ecosystem ``health{''} and ``stress{''}. A number of univariate
   metrics have been proposed to monitor health, including indicator
   species, indicator ratios and diversity or contaminant metrics.
   Alternatively, multivariate methods can be used to test for changes in
   community structure due to stress. In this study we developed
   multivariate models using statistical ordination techniques to identify
   key stressors affecting the `health' of estuarine macrofaunal
   communities. Macrofaunal and associated environmental samples were
   collected across 75 sites from within Tauranga Harbour, a large estuary
   located on New Zealand's North Island. The harbour receives discharges
   from urbanised, industrial, agricultural and horticultural catchments.
   Distance-based linear modelling identified sediments, nutrients and
   heavy metals as key `stressors' affecting the ecology of the harbour.
   Therefore, three multivariate models were developed based on the
   variability in community composition using canonical analysis of
   principal coordinates (CAP). The multivariate models were found to be
   more sensitive to changing environmental health than simple univariate
   measures (abundance, species richness, evenness and Shannon-Wiener
   diversity) along an anthropogenic stress gradient. This multivariate
   approach can be used as a management or monitoring tool where sites are
   repeatedly sampled over time and tracked to determine whether the
   communities are moving towards a more healthy or unhealthy state.
   Ultimately, such statistical models provide a tool to forecast the
   distribution and abundance of species associated with habitat change and
   should enable long-term degradative change from multiple disturbances to
   be assessed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Context Functional connectivity-the facilitation of individual movements
   among habitat patches-is essential for species' persistence in
   fragmented landscapes. Evaluating functional connectivity is critical
   for predicting range shifts, developing conservation plans, and
   anticipating effects of disturbance, especially for species affected by
   climate change.
   Objectives We examined whether simplifying forest structure influenced
   animal movements and whether an experimental approach to quantifying
   functional connectivity reflects normal behavior, which is often assumed
   but remains untested.
   Methods We evaluated functional connectivity for Pacific marten (Martes
   caurina) across a gradient in forest structural complexity using two
   novel methods for this species: incentivized food-titration experiments
   and non-incentivized locations collected via GPS telemetry (24
   individuals).
   Results Food titration experiments revealed martens selected complex
   stands, and martens entered and crossed areas with reduced forest cover
   when motivated by bait, particularly in the winter. However, our
   telemetry data showed that without such incentive, martens avoided
   openings and simple stands and selected complex forest stands equally
   during summer and winter.
   Conclusions Detections at baited stations may not represent typical
   habitat preferences during winter, and incentivized experiments reflect
   the capacity of martens to enter non-preferred stand types under high
   motivation (e.g., hunger, curiosity, dispersal). We hypothesize snow
   cover facilitates connectivity across openings when such motivation is
   present; thus, snow cover may benefit dispersing animals and increase
   population connectivity. Landscapes with joined networks of complex
   stands are crucial for maintaining functional connectivity for marten,
   particularly during summer.}},

Abstract = {{Many uncertainties emerge dealing with future climate conditions and
   their possible impacts on forests. In this paper we suggest a
   probabilistic approach extending existing ensemble species distribution
   modeling concepts by addressing important sources of uncertainty. We
   exemplify our approach using European beech as the target tree species
   and bioclimatic predictors derived from WorldClim data. Model parameter
   uncertainty is represented by 1000 parameter samples from a Bayesian
   generalized linear model. Climate change impact (CCI) is based on 63
   different climate model outputs using four RCP-scenarios (Representative
   Concentration Pathways) in addition to the parameter uncertainty. The
   proposed difference of the probability of occurrence p(occ) to a
   predefined threshold, allows for evaluation of parameter uncertainty as
   well as for the uncertainty of future climate and describes the changing
   niche position. Further, we suggest the probability that the probability
   of occurrence exceeds a predefined threshold (p(exc)) as a metric for
   the distance of a site to the niche edge. These metrics are
   unambiguously determinable, intuitive and evident. Stands at a central,
   a marginal and an intermediate niche position are taken to exemplify
   deduction and application of pox and pexc. A regional exercise shows how
   a map of p(exc) may support forest management planning and decision
   making under severe uncertainty. A key advantage of our novel metrics is
   the reformulation of common species distribution model (SDM) outputs in
   terms of risk thereby accounting for two important sources of
   uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A key challenge for models of community ecology is to combine
   deterministic mechanism and stochastic drift in a systematic,
   transparent and tractable manner. Another challenge is to explain and
   unify different ecological patterns, hitherto modelled in isolation,
   within a single modelling framework. Here, we show that statistical
   mechanics provides an effective way to meet both challenges. We apply
   the statistical principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) to a simple
   resource-based, non-neutral model of a plant community. In contrast to
   previous ecological applications of MaxEnt, our use of MaxEnt emphasises
   its theoretical basis in the combinatorics of sampling frequencies, an
   approach that clarifies its ecological interpretation. In this approach,
   mechanism and drift are identified, respectively, with ecological
   resource constraints and entropy maximization. We obtain realistic
   predictions for species abundance distributions as well as contrasting
   stability-diversity relationships at community and population levels.
   The model also predicts critical behaviour that may provide a basis for
   understanding desertification and other ecological tipping points. Our
   results complement and extend previous ecological applications of MaxEnt
   to new areas of community ecology, and further illustrate MaxEnt as a
   powerful yet simple modelling tool for combining mechanism and drift in
   a way that unifies disparate ecological patterns.}},

   2. mvMORPH allows fitting a range of multivariate evolutionary models

   of phylogenetic analysis of multiple morphometric traits, its use can be
   extended to any biological data set with one or multiple covarying

   SIMMAP-like mapping, which may be useful for fitting changes along
   lineages at a given point in time. All models provide diagnostic metrics
   for convergence and reliability of estimates, as well as the possibility
   to include trait measurement errors in model estimates.
   3. New features provided by the mvMORPH package include the possibility
   of fitting models with changes in the mode of evolution along the
   phylogeny, which will be particularly meaningful in comparative analyses
   that include extinct taxa, for example when testing changes in

Abstract = {{One of the founding principles of modem aquatic ecology is that
   human-induced perturbations in the autotrophherbivore interface have the
   potential to affect ecological processes at higher trophic levels. Thus,
   zooplankton's physiological state can be an early warning sign of
   broader impairments of aquatic ecosystems. Based on this reasoning, the
   micro-crustacean Daphnia is often identified as a keystone freshwater
   species, but its bioenergetic motivations and physiological priorities
   remain only partially understood. Using a bioenergetically explicit
   ecophysiological approach, we model how trade-offs in resource

   approach to metabolite utilization challenges the popular paradigm of
   elemental stoichiometry being the primary regulatory factor of algal
   food quality. We examine the post-gut bioenergetic ramifications of an
   unbalanced diet, showing that animal growth can be significantly

   modeling framework offers an excellent stepping-stone to connect
   zooplankton physiological processes with the signals of external
   stressors, and subsequently evaluate the patterns of mass and energy
   flow at an ecosystem scale. The proposed microscopic-to-macroscopic
   strategy will likely offer a new prospect towards the development of

Abstract = {{During the last decades, ecologists have paid a great deal of attention
   to the proper techniques to track fish movement in the wild. In this
   context, otoliths have proved useful and were increasingly used in a
   wide range of species worldwide. Otolith material incorporates elements
   from the surrounding water in a layered manner that preserves the timing
   of deposition. Elemental composition along otolith centre-edge transects
   thus represent a permanent record of the growing habitats experienced by
   the fish throughout its entire lifetime. While the analysis of these
   elements is of primary importance in fishery management and population
   ecology, the traditional approaches mostly fail to capture the
   multivariate nature of structural change in time series data. In this
   paper, I propose a simple approach aiming at coping with the
   multi-elemental compositional otolith transect in a multi-scale
   quantitative manner. More specifically, the proposed recursive
   partitioning method tries to bias the chronological clustering process
   by accommodating some form of user-specified constraints based on both
   intra- and inter-groups characteristics. This allows researchers to
   focus on biologically relevant information (i.e. the one researcher look
   for and can interpret). The finding of this study may be considered from
   the more general perspective of the utility of chronological clustering
   study of multivariate time series. Chronological clustering based on
   recursive partition is easily interpretable and directly applicable to
   detection of hidden discontinuities in any multivariate time series. In
   a multi-proxy context, it also provides a powerful exploratory tool for
   assessing the relative importance of cross-correlated variables in
   structuring the environmental histories, as well as the congruency
   between variables. Ultimately, this approach demonstrates the actual
   interest in using advanced processing techniques to fully exploit the
   rich potential of individual biological archives, such as fish otoliths,
   to characterize individual life history. This appears as a promising new
   tool for ecologists wishing to extract environmental histories from
   dendro- and sderochronological structures and would be a great help for
   practitioners working with chemical fingerprints. New functions for

Abstract = {{An individual-based model of animal dispersal and population dynamics
   was used to test the effects of different climate change adaptation
   strategies on species range shifting ability, namely the improvement of
   existing habitat, restoration of low quality habitat and creation of new
   habitat. These strategies were implemented on a landscape typical of
   fragmentation in the United Kingdom using spatial rules to differentiate
   between the allocation of strategies adjacent to or away from existing
   habitat patches. The total area being managed in the landscape was set
   at realistic levels based on recent habitat management trends. Eight
   species were parameterised to broadly represent different stage
   structure, population densities and modes of dispersal. Simulations were
   initialised with the species occupying 20\% of the landscape and run for
   100 years. As would be expected for a range of real taxa, range shifting
   abilities were dramatically different. This translated into large
   differences in their responses to the adaptation strategies. With
   conservative (0.5\%) estimates of the area prescribed for climate change
   adaptation, few species display noticeable improvements in their range
   shifting, demonstrating the need for greater investment in future
   adaptation. With a larger (1\%) prescribed area, greater range shifting
   improvements were found, although results were still species-specific.
   It was found that increasing the size of small existing habitat patches
   was the best way to promote range shifting, and that the creation of new
   stepping stone features, whilst beneficial to some species, did not have
   such broad effect across different species. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   Ecology and Ecological Monographs and since 1967 in Journal of
   Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. We show that the local spatial
   extent and all metrics of complexity increased as a positive, log-linear
   function of time. In contrast, the size of experimental units (spatial
   grain) decreased with time. Quantile regression analysis revealed that
   these trends are largely driven by changes in the upper bounds of
   experimental scale and complexity; most studies are still relatively
   simple in design and conducted over small areas. A structural equation
   model (SEM) incorporated the direct and indirect effects of six metrics
   indicating that the complexity of field experiments has increased both
   as a direct effect of time and because experiments have become smaller
   in spatial grain. The SEM also showed longer experiments tended to be
   more complex. We show striking habitat differences, as subtidal
   experiments (CR, RS) involved more species and were carried out on the
   largest global spatial scales. RI experiments were the longest. Future
   prospects to incorporate more of the complexity of nature into field
   experiments include site replication, as only 34.7\% of all experiments
   were conducted at more than one site, open experimental designs
   monitored by technology, and integrating experimental manipulations with
   long-term monitoring to achieve mechanistic insight across scales
   relevant to human alteration of the biosphere. The increasing resolution
   of remote sensing also creates opportunities to track experiment-driven
   changes in community structure across large scales. We suggest applying
   these methods to a wider class of problems to enhance our understanding
   of marine communities and ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed-severity fire regimes may be the most extensive yet poorly
   understood fire regimes of western North America. Understanding their
   long-term spatiotemporal dynamics is central to debates regarding
   altered fire regimes and the need for restoration in the context of
   changing climate and nearly a century of active fire suppression.
   However, the complexity of fire patterns and forest stand and landscape
   structures characteristic of mixed-severity regimes poses a substantial
   challenge to understanding their long-term dynamics. In this study, we
   develop analysis methods aimed at understanding the fire-driven forest
   dynamics of mixed-severity systems and apply them in the San Juan
   Mountains of southwestern Colorado. We sampled fire scars, stand
   structure, and >4300 tree ages across two 1340-ha landscapes (Williams
   Creek and Squaretop Mountain) that span the environmental gradient of
   montane mixed-conifer and aspen forests. New approaches were applied to
   identify pulses of tree recruitment, evaluate climate and fire as
   potential drivers of synchronous recruitment pulses, and combine fire
   scar and recruitment data to reconstruct fires. The reconstructions
   provided detailed fire history for each stand, which in turn was used to
   develop a fire-severity metric, compare fire frequency and severity by
   forest type, and develop a simulation procedure to evaluate the degree
   to which tree regeneration depended on fire by species within each
   forest type. Twenty fires were reconstructed since 1685 at Williams
   Creek and 13 fires since 1748 at Squaretop Mountain. Patterns of fire
   severity varied within each fire and over successive events, including
   high-severity patches of hundreds of hectares in both study areas. Dry
   mixed-conifer forests experienced relatively short fire intervals (mean
   21 years) and low fire severity, and regeneration of the main conifer
   species was largely dependent on open conditions sustained over
   successive fires. Moist mixed-conifer forests experienced longer fire
   intervals (mean 32 years) and a broader range of severities, and
   fire-caused canopy openings were important for initiating pulses of tree
   recruitment. Most (83\%) aspen stands included two or more post-fire
   cohorts. The methods presented here can be adapted to other
   mixed-severity systems to better understand their long-term spatial and
   temporal dynamics and develop restoration priorities.}},

Abstract = {{Population models in ecology are often not good at predictions, even if
   they are complex and seem to be realistic enough. The reason for this
   might be that Occam's razor, which is key for minimal models exploring
   ideas and concepts, has been too uncritically adopted for more realistic
   models of systems. This can tic models too closely to certain
   situations, thereby preventing them from predicting the response to new
   conditions. We therefore advocate a new kind of parsimony to improve the
   application of Occam's razor. This new parsimony balances two
   contrasting strategies for avoiding errors in modeling: avoiding
   inclusion of nonessential factors (false inclusions) and avoiding
   exclusion of sometimes-important factors (false exclusions). It involves
   a synthesis of traditional modeling and analysis, used to describe the
   essentials of mechanistic relationships, with elements that arc included
   in a model because they have been reported to be or can arguably be
   assumed to be important under certain conditions. The resulting models
   should be able to reflect how the internal organization of populations

Pages = {{1658-1666}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There is a lack of consensus in theoretical and empirical literature on
   whether height-diameter (H:D) relationships of canopy trees are
   asymptotic. To investigate H:D allometry, particularly in the transition
   to the canopy, we focused on shade-tolerant Abies balsamea, across steep
   physical gradients associated with elevation, and correlated biotically
   generated gradients of stem density, canopy height and canopy species
   composition. We addressed these questions: A. What is the relation
   between H:D allometric form and emergence into the canopy? B. Is H:D
   allometry asymptotic? C. What aspects of the H:D relationship are most
   sensitive to environmental conditions? Using maximum likelihood, we
   compared the performance of alternative H:D forms (linear, power
   function, non-sigmoid asymptotic and sigmoid asymptotic), incorporating
   elevation and local canopy height as covariates.Abies balsamea H:D
   allometric form was clearly sigmoid asymptotic, by a wide AIC margin,
   across all gradients, to an asymptote slightly above canopy height. The
   commonly used power function had essentially no empirical support
   (AIC>>10). Canopy height decreased with elevation, but with much
   variation, so elevation was a poor predictor of the asymptote. Across
   environmental gradients, H:D allometries overlapped for trees far below
   the canopy, but diverged strongly for trees approaching different canopy
   heights. Changes in resource allocation and modification of growth form
   that could generate asymptotic H:D allometries are consistent with known
   physical forces and diverse research findings in tree developmental
   biology and physiology.Synthesis. The H:D asymptote and its tight
   relation to canopy height, unapparent in aggregated H:D data, became
   clear only when canopy height and elevation were included explicitly in
   allometric models. Asymptotic H:D allometries may be the norm, though
   often undetected, in unmanaged forests without recent catastrophic
   disturbance. Appropriate asymptotic H:D models may reduce error in
   forest carbon and biomass estimation and promote theoretical and
   empirical integration in the ecology and evolution of tree allometry.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1236-1248}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aim Biodiversity patterns and the mechanisms driving these patterns are
   inherently scale dependent. Studies investigating biodiversity scaling
   have focused mostly on evaluating community turnover without taking into
   consideration its underlying processes of local extinction (hereafter,
   extinction) and colonization. Our goal was to evaluate the spatial
   scaling of change in avian assemblages through time and identify
   environmental drivers of community-wide dynamics across a range of
   spatial scales, with a focus on extinction and colonization.
   Location New York State.
   Methods We analysed community dissimilarity, temporal turnover,
   extinction and colonization as measures of temporal change in avian
   communities at five spatial resolutions (5x5, 10x10, 20x20, 40x40 and
   80kmx80km). We evaluated the relationships between community change and
   change in climatic conditions, landscape fragmentation and elevation at
   each spatial grain using Bayesian spatially varying intercept models.
   Results We found that the decline in colonization with increasing
   spatial scale was less steep than the decline in community
   dissimilarity, temporal turnover or extinction. We also found that the
   importance of environmental drivers to community change was dependent on
   both scale and metric, though we did not find optimal spatial scales at
   which either landscape or climatic processes consistently drove patterns
   of community change. Landscape characteristics were the most important
   correlate of extinction at all spatial scales, while colonization was
   not predicted well by any of the environmental factors.
   Main conclusions The slower decline in colonization across spatial
   grains is probably a consequence of the high mobility and dispersal
   abilities of birds. We further conclude that the two processes
   underlying community change - extinction and colonization - are driven
   by different factors. Landscape characteristics strongly affect the
   rates of extinctions in avian communities. On the contrary, patterns of
   colonization are likely to be a result of intrinsic characteristics of
   birds - specifically, high dispersal ability - that allow them to
   colonize new sites, regardless of the environmental context.}},

Abstract = {{Infectious disease transmission often depends on the contact structure
   of host populations. Although it is often challenging to capture the
   contact structure in wild animals, new technology has enabled biologists
   to obtain detailed temporal information on wildlife social contacts. In
   this study, we investigated the effects of raccoon contact patterns on
   rabies spread using network modelling. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) play an
   important role in the maintenance of rabies in the United States. It is
   crucial to understand how contact patterns influence the spread of
   rabies in raccoon populations in order to design effective control
   measures and to prevent transmission to human populations and other
   animals. We constructed a dynamic system of contact networks based on
   empirical data from proximity logging collars on a wild suburban raccoon
   population and then simulated rabies spread across these networks. Our
   contact networks incorporated the number and duration of raccoon
   interactions. We included differences in contacts according to sex and
   season, and both short-term acquaintances and long-term associations.
   Raccoons may display different behaviours when infectious, including
   aggression (furious behaviour) and impaired mobility (dumb behaviour);
   the network model was used to assess the impact of potential behavioural
   changes in rabid raccoons. We also tested the effectiveness of different
   vaccination coverage levels. Our results demonstrate that when rabies
   enters a suburban raccoon population, the likelihood of a disease
   outbreak affecting the majority of the population is high. Both the
   magnitude of rabies outbreaks and the speed of rabies spread depend
   strongly on the time of year that rabies is introduced into the
   population. When there is a combination of dumb and furious behaviours
   in the rabid raccoon population, there are similar outbreak sizes and
   speed of spread to when there are no behavioural changes due to rabies
   infection. By incorporating detailed data describing the variation in
   raccoon contact rates into a network modelling approach, we were able to
   show that suburban raccoon populations are highly susceptible to rabies
   outbreaks, that the risk of large outbreaks varies seasonally and that
   current vaccination target levels may be inadequate to prevent the
   spread of rabies within these populations. Our findings provide new
   insights into rabies dynamics in raccoon populations and have important
   implications for disease control.}},

Abstract = {{Although herbaceous perennial crops are becoming a larger component of
   bioenergy production both in the United States and worldwide, there is
   growing concern that these crops pose a substantial risk of biological
   invasion. Miscanthus x giganteus, a sterile hybrid native to Asia, is
   considered an ideal biofuel crop for lands that are poorly suited for
   annual food crops and is currently being tested by growers. A fertile
   variety of M. x giganteus was developed by seed and energy companies in
   an effort to decrease the costs associated with planting rhizomes. No
   regulations have been established to manage the risk of invasion by the
   fertile variety. Because bioenergy production is expanding rapidly, and
   the few studies to quantify invasion risks in this species have
   addressed small spatial scales, we used a modeling approach to explore a
   broader domain of invasion scenarios at landscape scales. We implemented
   a spatially-explicit population model of fertile M. x giganteus to
   determine the efficacy of proposed management strategies in limiting or
   slowing the spread of this species. We found that fertile M. x giganteus
   may spread rapidly outside of field margins, and the ability of
   localized management strategies to curtail spread was highly sensitive
   to M. x giganteus first year survival and the amount of suitable habitat
   within the larger landscape. Commercialization of novel ``bioeconomy
   crops{''}, such as fertile M. x giganteus, could increase both
   production and resource conservation in agriculture; however, these
   crops may also produce ecosystem ``disservices{''} such as biological
   invasion and accompanying risks to native species. Landscape-scale
   modeling that allows for rapid testing of the interactions between new
   crop genotypes and landscape configurations will be a powerful tool for
   exploring the ecological risks posed by new bioeconomy crops.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid, reliable and meaningful estimates of leaf area index (LAI) are
   essential to functional characterization of forest ecosystems including
   biomass and primary productivity studies. Accurate LAI estimates of
   tropical deciduous forest are required in studies of regional and global
   change modeling. Tropical deciduous forest due to higher species
   richness, multiple species association, varied phenophases, irregular
   stem densities and basal cover, multistoried canopy architecture and
   different micro-climatic conditions offers dynamism to the understanding
   of the LAI dynamics of different PFTs in an ecosystem. This
   investigation reports a new indirect method for measurement of leaf area
   index (LAI) in a topical moist deciduous forest in Himalayan foothills
   using LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer. We measured the LAI in two seasons
   (summer; leaf senescence stage and post-monsoon; full green stage) in
   three (dry miscellaneous, sal mixed and teak plantations) plant
   functional types (PFT) in Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, India. Ground
   LAI values ranged between 2.41 and 6.89, 1.17 and 7.71, and 1.92 and

   during summer season in dry miscellaneous, sal mixed and teak

   community structural parameters (tree density, basal cover and species
   richness), with maximum with annual litter fall (R-2 > 0.8) and
   aboveground biomass (AGB) (R-2 > 0.75). We provided equations relating
   LAI with AGB, which can be utilized in future studies for this region
   and can be reasonably extrapolated to other regions with suitable
   statistical extrapolations. However, the relations between LAI and other
   parameters can be further improved with incorporation of data from
   optimized and seasonal sampling. Our indirect method of LAI estimation
   using litter fall as a proxy, offers repetitive potential for LAI

Abstract = {{We devised a participatory modeling approach for setting management
   thresholds that show when management intervention is required to address
   undesirable ecosystem changes. This approach was designed to be used
   when management thresholds: must be set for environmental indicators in
   the face of multiple competing objectives; need to incorporate
   scientific understanding and value judgments; and will be set by
   participants with limited modeling experience. We applied our approach
   to a case study where management thresholds were set for a mat-forming
   brown alga, Hormosira banksii, in a protected area management context.
   Participants, including management staff and scientists, were involved
   in a workshop to test the approach, and set management thresholds to
   address the threat of trampling by visitors to an intertidal rocky reef.
   The approach involved trading off the environmental objective, to
   maintain the condition of intertidal reef communities, with social and
   economic objectives to ensure management intervention was
   cost-effective. Ecological scenarios, developed using scenario planning,
   were a key feature that provided the foundation for where to set
   management thresholds. The scenarios developed represented declines in
   percent cover of H. banksii that may occur under increased threatening
   processes. Participants defined 4 discrete management alternatives to
   address the threat of trampling and estimated the effect of these
   alternatives on the objectives under each ecological scenario. A
   weighted additive model was used to aggregate participants' consequence
   estimates. Model outputs (decision scores) clearly expressed
   uncertainty, which can be considered by decision makers and used to
   inform where to set management thresholds. This approach encourages a
   proactive form of conservation, where management thresholds and
   associated actions are defined a priori for ecological indicators,
   rather than reacting to unexpected ecosystem changes in the future.}},

Abstract = {{In Brazil, as much as 50\% of the native tropical savannas and woodlands
   (known as the Cerrado) have been converted to farmland under intensive
   agriculture. Land cover change at this scale has important implications
   for water and energy budgets, but at present, these implications are
   poorly understood. A promising new technology for elucidating these
   relationships at large scales is remote sensing; but results obtained by
   this method need to be verified with ground-based measurements. For this
   study, we used remote sensing to estimate changes in energy balance and
   evapotranspiration (ET) in SAo Paulo State following conversion of
   native Cerrado woodlands to cultivated land for sugar cane and
   eucalyptus. We applied the surface energy balance algorithm for land
   (SEBAL) to ten TM-Landsat 5 images taken during 2005 at two locations
   (sugar cane fields and Cerrado woodlands). The SEBAL ET results were
   compared with ET data obtained via eddy covariance. There was good
   agreement between the two (R-2=087), with no systematic overestimation
   or underestimation by SEBAL. Our SEBAL analysis indicated that land
   cover change causes strong shifts in albedo, land-surface temperature,
   and vegetation index - all of which affect energy balance and ET. Both
   the SEBAL and eddy covariance measurements indicate that ET for sugar
   cane is only about 70\% of that for native woodlands. SEBAL estimates
   found that, for cultivated eucalyptus plantations, ET was about 88\% of
   that for Cerrado forests. Our results indicate that the SEBAL
   methodology is a reliable tool for estimating energy budgets and ET in
   Cerrado landscapes and, further, that large-scale conversion of Cerrado
   woodlands to agricultural land significantly alters energy budgets and
   ET. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   managers to prioritize crossing sites for implementing road
   fragmentation mitigation measures. We propose a new method that
   addresses these limitations. We illustrate this method with data from
   southwestern Gabon (central Africa). We used stratified random transect
   surveys conducted in two seasons to model the distribution of African
   forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer
   nanus), and sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii) in a mosaic landscape along a
   38.5 km unpaved road scheduled for paving. Using a validation data set
   of recorded crossing locations, we evaluated the performance of three
   types of models (local suitability, local least-cost movement, and
   regional least-cost movement) in predicting actual road crossings for
   each species, and developed a unique and flexible scoring method for
   prioritizing road sections for the implementation of road fragmentation
   mitigation measures. With a data set collected in <10 weeks of
   fieldwork, the method was able to identify seasonal changes in animal
   movements for buffalo and sitatunga that shift from a local exploitation
   of the site in the wet season to movements through the study site in the
   dry season, whereas elephants use the entire study area in both seasons.
   These three species highlighted the need to use species-and
   season-specific modeling of movement. From these movement models, the
   method ranked road sections for their suitability for implementing
   fragmentation mitigation efforts, allowing managers to adjust priority
   thresholds based on budgets and management goals. The method relies on
   data that can be obtained in a period compatible with environmental
   impact assessment constraints, and is flexible enough to incorporate
   other potential movement models and scoring criteria. This approach
   improves upon available methods and can help inform prioritization of
   road and other linear infrastructure segments that require impact
   mitigation methods to ensure long-term landscape connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Early in their evolution, angiosperms evolved a diversity of leaf
   form far greater than that of any other group of land plants. Some of
   this diversity evolved in response to varying climate. Our aim is to
   test the global relationship between leaf form in woody dicot
   angiosperms and the climate in which they live.
   Location We have compiled a data set describing leaf form(using 31
   standardized categorical characters) from 378 natural or naturalized
   vegetation sites from around the world. Our data include sites from all
   continents except Antarctica and encompass biomes from tropical to
   taiga, over a range of elevations from 0.5 m to over 3000 m.
   Methods We chose the Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program
   sampling, scoring and analytical protocols to test the relationships
   between climate and leaf form, which is based on canonical
   correspondence analysis. Cluster analysis evaluates the role of
   historical factors in shaping the patterns, and pairwise Pearson
   correlations examine the relationships among leaf characters.
   Results Woody dicot leaf characters form a physiognomic spectrum that
   reflects local climate conditions. On a global scale, correlations
   between leaf form and climate are consistent, irrespective of climate
   regime, vegetation type or biogeographic history. Relationships with
   temperature variables are maintained even when leaf margin characters,
   regarded as being particularly well correlated with mean annual
   temperature, are removed.
   Main conclusions In natural woody dicot vegetation an integrated
   spectrum of leaf form has developed across multiple leaf character
   states and species. This spectrum appears more strongly influenced by
   prevailing climate than biogeographic history. The covariation of leaf
   traits across species suggests strong integration of leaf form. New
   methods of exploring structure in multidimensional physiognomic space
   enable better application of leaf form to palaeoclimate reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{Collaborative models for environmental management are emerging in New
   Zealand. At the forefront are processes for coastal and freshwater
   environments. It is proposed that application of sociometric methods and
   skilled facilitation can produce leadership from local communities,
   creating more enduring solutions than occur from central and regional
   government initiatives. This paper presents examples of how this
   approach has been adopted in situations at local and regional scales.
   Three case studies of integrated management initiatives are analysed in
   a sociometric framework at stages of development from pre-initiation
   research to completed legislation and implementation, in the context of
   a national legal framework. The full development of a community led
   programme is demonstrated using the Kaikoura integrated coastal
   management programme. An analysis of the Top of the South Marine
   Biosecurity Partnership shows how scope reduction can aid successful
   collaboration. Finally, the Hauraki Gulf Sea Change project is used to
   describe how the approach is being adapted and scaled to a more complex
   situation in the area of highest population density in New Zealand.
   These three case studies are compared and contrasted to draw out
   commonalities, lessons learned, and the potential for these approaches
   to be applied elsewhere. Systemic, sociometric and structural analyses
   are used to define the elements needed for consensus to emerge at the
   local level and to be translated into regional and national
   administrative systems. Collaborative processes are found to be useful
   for complex issues involving multiple parties with overlapping
   interests, making these approaches suitable for integrated coastal

Abstract = {{1. With the use of stable isotopes, new concepts have emerged based on
   the idea that the ecological niche can be approximated by the isotopic
   niche defined as a -space area with isotopic values as coordinates. This
   study aims to (i) redefine functional indices originally based on
   quantitative biological traits of species and demonstrate the ecological
   significance of newly defined isotopic functional indices (IFI) in a
   -isotopic space, (ii) compare IFI using biomass data with existing
   unweighted isotopic indices using only isotopic compositions.
   2. Using a community-wide approach, we tested IFI using isotopic
   compositions of a large set of associated species from two marine
   benthic communities widely reported in coastal shallow waters: the
   common Amphiura filiformis muddy-sand community and the engineered
   Haploops nirae sandy-mud community. Biomass and isotopic composition
   (C-13 and N-15) of all species were measured during four seasons.
   3. IFI were calculated in the isotopic space defined by the two
   communities, and variations were analysed: (i) isotopic functional
   richness indices measure the overall extent of the community trophic
   niche. They are higher in the Haploops community due to a higher
   diversity in food sources but also to longer food chains. (ii) isotopic
   functional evenness indices quantify the regularity in species
   distribution and the density in species packing. They showed that the
   biomass is concentrated at the edges of the food web in the Haploops
   community, outside the isotopic range of the main food source. (iii)
   isotopic functional divergence indices quantify the degree to which
   species distribution maximizes the divergence. They showed a larger
   utilization of secondary food sources in the Haploops community.
   4. The IFI variations responded according to expectations overall, based
   on the extensive knowledge of those communities. Results highlighted
   that IFI weighted with species biomass provide new insights into how the
   structure of energy accumulation as biomass between species is likely to
   underpin community structure and the interplay between structural
   components of richness, diversity and evenness of biomass distribution.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a simple ecological index to monitor wetlands, based on
   interannual changes in waterbird numbers and the hydro-ecological
   characteristics of their wintering sites. This new method provides a
   simple tool applicable to most types of wetlands in northern Africa with
   comparable waterbird species and hydrological attributes. Scores of this
   ecological index are calculated through a four-steps approach: (1)
   discriminate prospected sites into different associations based on their
   hydro-ecological characteristics; (2) compute indicator values for each
   waterbird species considered to quantify the strength of species-habitat
   relationships in each wetland associations; (3) calculate the relative
   rate of temporal change in indicator species abundances between two
   sampling events (in our example 2001-2013 and 1970/2000); (4) compute
   the weighted sum across species of the product of these two metrics
   within a given wetlands association. The application of our index to the
   monitoring of Tunisian wetlands suggests the degradation of wintering
   lagoons and salt pans and coastal environments. Nevertheless, applying
   the index in floodplains and garaets tends to indicate improved
   overwintering conditions, especially for man-tolerant waterbird species.

Abstract = {{One of the most damaging insect pests to tomato crops is the tomato
   leafminer, Tuta absoluta. Current control methods are not efficient at
   regulating this pest below the economic threshold, leading to the
   development of new strategies based on its natural enemies. In this
   study, we evaluated the ability of Macrolophus pygmaeus to discriminate
   T. absoluta-infested plants versus non-infested tomato plants. We
   subsequently collected volatile organic chemicals released by tomato
   plants under different levels of infestation, and identified the
   associated herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Behavioural assays
   were conducted in a double-choice olfactometer and flight tunnel. In
   both systems, M. pygmaeus was significantly attracted towards infested
   plants. Because distance attraction is likely to be mediated, at least
   partially, by volatile organic compounds, HIPVs were collected from
   healthy and infested plants using a dynamic volatile collection system.
   Volatile chemical profiles vary with the level of infestation;
   specifically, twice as many chemicals were identified under infestation
   by 20 T. absoluta larvae compared to healthy plants. A total of 35
   compounds were identified, with beta-phellandrene, 2-carene,
   beta-caryophyllene, alpha-pinene and alpha-phellandrene representing
   76-86 \% of the total blend. The release of monoterpenes was strongly
   influenced by the level of caterpillar infestation, while the amount of
   sesquiterpenes did not vary significantly. We hypothesise that certain

Abstract = {{Recent droughts and increasing temperatures have resulted in extensive
   tree mortality across the globe. Understanding the environmental
   controls on tree regeneration following these drought events will allow
   for better predictions of how these ecosystems may shift under a warmer,
   drier climate. Within the widely distributed pinon-juniper woodlands of
   the southwestern USA, a multiyear drought in 2002-2004 resulted in
   extensive adult pinon mortality and shifted adult woodland composition
   to a juniper-dominated, more savannah-type ecosystem. Here, we used pre-
   (1998-2001) and 10-year post- (2014) drought stand structure data of
   individually mapped trees at 42 sites to assess the effects of this
   drought on tree regeneration across a gradient of environmental stress.
   We found declines in pinon juvenile densities since the multiyear
   drought due to limited new recruitment and high (>50\%) juvenile
   mortality. This is in contrast to juniper juvenile densities, which
   increased over this time period. Across the landscape, pinon recruitment
   was positively associated with live adult pinon densities and soil
   available water capacity, likely due to their respective effects on seed
   and water availability. Juvenile pinon survival was strongly facilitated
   by certain types of nurse trees and shrubs. These nurse plants also
   moderated the effects of environmental stress on pinon survival:
   Survival of interspace pinon juveniles was positively associated with
   soil available water capacity, whereas survival of nursed pinon
   juveniles was negatively associated with perennial grass cover. Thus,
   nurse plants had a greater facilitative effect on survival at sites with
   higher soil available water capacity and perennial grass cover. Notably,
   mean annual climatic water deficit and elevation were not associated
   with pinon recruitment or survival across the landscape. Our findings
   reveal a clear shift in successional trajectories toward a more
   juniper-dominated woodland and highlight the importance of incorporating
   biotic interactions and soil properties into species distribution
   modeling approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Along the arid Arava, southern Israel, acacia trees are considered
   keystone species. Based on survival of acacias through drought years
   that have not seen a single rainfall or flood, it is assumed that
   acacias endure the local harsh conditions by drawing water from deep
   underground water reservoirs. Studying water use of acacias has so far
   been done by exposing root systems or by isotopic water measurements,
   both problematic methods.
   We present a new application of a two-dimensional direct current
   electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to measure the electrical
   resistivity of the subsurface. We applied the ERT device to two fixed
   100 m transects cutting across (north-south) and along (west-east) the
   super arid Gidron Wadi during March, April and August 2013. An inversion
   model was used to create a map of electrical resistivity of the layers
   below ground, an indirect indicator of the underground water content. We
   identified a conductive layer located at similar to 7-10 m below ground
   in all surveys. Although we could not identify changes to this apparent
   perched aquifer, such a layer may be a secondary source of water for
   acacias that can explain their survival in drought years. Further
   ERT-aided studies are needed to correlate acacia distribution and
   ecophysiological state with perched aquifers, even if quantitative
   analysis of their replenishment in such desert environments is not

   predict long-term survival in temporarily captive sea lions (n = 45)
   through Cormack-Jolly-Seber open population modelling techniques. The
   first analysis investigated survival in relation to the observed
   responses to handling stress through changes in six principal blood
   parameters over the duration of captivity. The second analysis evaluated
   survival compared with body condition and mass at entry and exit from
   captivity. Finally, the third analysis sought to evaluate the efficacy
   of single-point sampling to project similar survival trends for use in

   Akaike information criterion model selection methods indicated that mass
   gains (4.2 +/- 12\%) over captivity and increases in leucocytes (WBC,
   1.01 +/- 3.54 x 10(3)/mm(3)) resulted in a higher average survival rate
   (> 3 years). Minor support was identified for the single-point measures
   of exit mass and entry WBC. A higher exit mass predicted a higher

   While changes in mass and WBC appear to be the best predictors of

Abstract = {{Throughout the history of evolutionary process cooperation has played a
   significant role in species sodlogical development and social groups are
   more likely to be survived than individuals in apparently unfavorable
   conditions. We bring in the concept of cooperation and introduce a new
   parameter gamma in the generalized theta-logistic equation to model
   non-monotonic behavior of per capita growth rate. This phenomenological
   modeling approach highlights the interplay of two opposing forces,
   namely, the positive effect of cooperation and the negative density
   dependence (competition). Sibly et al. (2005) found that, the density
   dependent population growth curve seems to be concave in most animal
   populations, and follows the theta-logistic equation. To explore this
   phenomenon further, we investigated 715 time series from global

   incorporating intra-species cooperation as an allometric trait into the
   logistic improves the description of the population growth. Nonlinear
   regression and bootstrap resampling technique were used to estimate the

Abstract = {{Species distribution models (SDMs) are an important tool in biogeography
   and phylogeography studies, that most often require explicit absence
   information to adequately model the environmental space on which species
   can potentially inhabit. In the so-called background pseudo-absences
   approach, absence locations are simulated in order to obtain a complete
   sample of the environment. Whilst the commonest approach is random
   sampling of the entire study region, in its multiple variants, its
   performance may not be optimal, and the method of generation of
   pseudo-absences is known to have a significant influence on the results
   obtained. Here, we compare a suite of classic (random sampling) and
   novel methods for pseudo-absence data generation and propose a
   generalizable three-step method combining environmental profiling with a
   new technique for background extent restriction. To this aim, we
   consider 11 phylogenetic groups of Oak (Quercus sp.) described in

   model performance (area under the ROC curve), calibration (reliability
   diagrams) and the resulting suitability maps, using a cross-validation
   approach. Regardless of the modelling algorithm used, random-sampling
   models were outperformed by the methods that incorporate environmental
   profiling of the background, stressing the importance of the

Title = {{Classifying degrees of species commonness: North Sea fish as a case

Abstract = {{Species commonness is often related to abundance and species
   conservation status. Intuitively, a ``common species{''} is a species
   that is abundant in a certain area, widespread and at low risk of
   extinction. Analysing and classifying species commonness can help
   discovering indicators of ecosystem status and can prevent sudden
   changes in biodiversity. However, it is challenging to quantitatively
   define this concept. This paper presents a procedure to automatically
   characterize species commonness from biological surveys. Our approach
   uses clustering analysis techniques and is based on a number of
   numerical parameters extracted from an authoritative source of
   biodiversity data, i.e. the Ocean Biogeographic Information System. The
   analysis takes into account abundance, geographical and temporal aspects
   of species distributions. We apply our model to North Sea fish species
   and show that the classification agrees with independent expert opinion
   although sampling biases affect the data. Furthermore, we show that our
   approach is robust to noise in the data and is promising in classifying
   new species. Our method can be used in conservation biology, especially
   to reduce the effects of the sampling biases which affect large
   biodiversity collections. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The world's forests and forestry sector are facing unprecedented
   biological, political, social, and climatic challenges. The development
   of appropriate, novel forest management and restoration approaches that
   adequately consider uncertainty and adaptability are hampered by a
   continuing focus on production of a few goods or objectives, strong
   control of forest structure and composition, and most importantly the
   absence of a global scientific framework and long-term vision.
   Ecosystem-based approaches represent a step in the right direction, but
   are limited in their ability to deal with the rapid pace of social,
   climatic, and environmental changes. We argue here that viewing forest
   ecosystems as complex adaptive system provides a better alternative for
   both production- and conservation-oriented forests and forestry. We
   propose a set of broad principles and changes to increase the adaptive
   capacity of forests in the face of future uncertainties. These span from
   expanding the sustained-yield, single-good paradigm to developing policy
   incentives and interventions that promote self-organization and
   integrated social-ecological adaptation.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In a complex urban-impacted landscape, native black-tailed prairie dogs
   (Cynomys ludovicianus) amplify the trajectory at which grassland plant
   communities deviate from historical configurations. Prairie dog removal
   has been proposed as an intervention method based upon the premise that
   removing a major directional driver of change will initiate the recovery
   of historically common plant communities. However, in a heavily
   anthropogenically influenced landscape with a matrix containing only
   small fragmented areas of native vegetation, the recolonization speed
   and success of native plant species may not match those observed in less
   anthropogenically influenced landscapes. This study examined the effect
   of urban prairie dog removal by using remote sensing to observe the
   response of plant communities near Boulder, Colorado, USA to plague
   epizootics. We used Mann-Whitney U tests to compare the soil adjusted
   vegetation index (SAVI) values from colonies recently extirpated by
   plague to both areas unoccupied by prairie dogs and to plague-absent
   colonies. Analysis of 67 Landsat images in three growing season subsets
   suggested that prairie dog removal alone does not return colony plant
   communities to compositions representative of grassland areas unoccupied
   by prairie dogs. The absence of SAVI value changes in the mid-and
   late-growing seasons suggested that novel vegetation communities on
   urban prairie dog colonies were highly resilient systems, and prairie
   dog removal alone was insufficient for restoration. Furthermore,
   increased early season SAVI values on extirpated colonies could indicate
   a proliferation of introduced winter active species and exotic forbs,
   not the desired reemergence of native species, but rather species
   expected given current climatic changes. Intensive management efforts
   appear necessary for overcoming the thresholds required to restore urban
   prairie dog colonies to their historical compositions, an effort made
   increasingly more difficult with the ongoing effects of other global
   change drivers.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the relative importance of climatic and other environmental
   controls on the interannual variability and trends in global land
   surface phenology and greenness is challenging. Firstly, quantifications
   of land surface phenology and greenness dynamics are impaired by
   differences between satellite data sets and phenology detection methods.
   Secondly, dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) that can be used to
   diagnose controls still reveal structural limitations and contrasting
   sensitivities to environmental drivers. Thus, we assessed the
   performance of a new developed phenology module within the LPJmL
   (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Lands) DGVM with a comprehensive ensemble of
   three satellite data sets of vegetation greenness and ten phenology
   detection methods, thereby thoroughly accounting for observational
   uncertainties. The improved and tested model allows us quantifying the
   relative importance of environmental controls on interannual variability
   and trends of land surface phenology and greenness at regional and
   global scales. We found that start of growing season interannual
   variability and trends are in addition to cold temperature mainly
   controlled by incoming radiation and water availability in temperate and
   boreal forests. Warming-induced prolongations of the growing season in
   high latitudes are dampened by a limited availability of light. For peak
   greenness, interannual variability and trends are dominantly controlled
   by water availability and land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) in all
   regions. Stronger greening trends in boreal forests of Siberia than in
   North America are associated with a stronger increase in water
   availability from melting permafrost soils. Our findings emphasize that
   in addition to cold temperatures, water availability is a codominant
   control for start of growing season and peak greenness trends at the

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1506-1517}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A change in climate is known to affect seasonal timing (phenology) of
   the life stages of poikilothermic organisms whose development depends on
   temperature. Less understood is the potential for even greater
   disruption to the life cycle when a phenology shift exposes
   photoperiod-sensitive life stages to new day lengths. We present a
   conceptual framework and model to investigate the ways that
   photoperiod-cued diapause can interact with a change in climate or
   latitude to influence voltinism in poikilothermic organisms. Our
   degree-day phenology model combines detailed spatial climate data,
   latitude-and date-specific photoperiods, and development and photoperiod
   response parameters. As an example, we model the biological control
   beetle Galerucella calmariensis and map the number of generations
   expected following its introduction into diverse climates throughout the
   continental United States. Incorporation of photoperiodism results in a
   complex geography of voltinism that differs markedly from predictions of
   traditional phenology models. Facultative multivoltine species will be
   prone to univoltism when transported to either warmer or southern
   climates due to exposure of the sensitive stage to shorter day lengths.
   When moved to more northern locations, they may attempt too many
   generations for the season duration thereby exposing vulnerable life
   stages to harsh weather in the fall. We further show that even small
   changes in temperature can result in large and unexpected shifts in
   voltinism. Analogous effects may be expected for organisms from wide
   variety of taxa that use photoperiod as a seasonal cue during some stage
   of their life cycle. Our approach is useful for understanding the
   performance and impacts of introduced pests and beneficial organisms as
   well as for predicting responses of resident species to climate change

Abstract = {{AimConservation biologists use various approaches to augment imperilled
   populations in order to supplement genetic variation and restore
   ecological function. However, understanding genotypic, phenotypic and
   ecotypic variation is critical in determining the most suitable sources
   to conserve historical and functional variation. Bighorn sheep (Ovis
   canadensis) provide a classic example of restoration biology, where
   management programmes have re-established extirpated populations via
   translocations. Through this process, translocated individuals may now
   face novel environments, including new bioclimatic conditions and an
   opportunity to interbreed with historically isolated and distinct
   genetic units. Our goal was to integrate genetic and ecological analyses
   to assess some of the evolutionary ramifications of this important
   management practice.
   LocationWestern North America, but focused on the Great Basin and
   northern Mojave deserts.
   MethodsWe quantified genetic variation across 55 Herds of bighorn sheep
   using 16 microsatellite loci (N=347) and a mitochondrial gene (N=110).
   We used ordination, Bayesian clustering and phylogenetic analyses to
   delineate evolutionary units. We used multivariate ordination for 26
   ecologically relevant variables to characterize niche-based differences
   among genetic clusters and then tested whether repatriated populations
   occupy conditions similar to source areas.
   ResultsWe document genetic differentiation among three traditional
   management units of bighorn sheep that now occupy the Great Basin and
   northern Mojave deserts, but also identify limited hybridization among
   these groups. Niche-based analyses revealed that translocated
   populations now occur in conditions incongruent with source ranges.
   Main conclusionsThis study highlights the importance of considering both
   genetic variation and ecological differences when implementing
   translocations. Early consideration of these variables may help minimize
   the potential for hybridization among distinct groups and mitigate
   challenges of managing populations experiencing novel environments. More
   broadly, results from this study have implications for future
   restoration efforts in this iconic system, but also for similar
   translocation-based conservation programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Feather mites (Astigmata: Analgoidea and Pterolichoidea) are among the
   most abundant and commonly occurring bird ectosymbionts. Basic questions
   on the ecology and evolution of feather mites remain unanswered because
   feather mite species identification is often only possible for adult
   males, and it is laborious even for specialized taxonomists, thus
   precluding large-scale identifications. Here, we tested DNA barcoding as
   a useful molecular tool to identify feather mites from passerine birds.
   Three hundred and sixty-one specimens of 72 species of feather mites
   from 68 species of European passerine birds from Russia and Spain were
   barcoded. The accuracy of barcoding and minibarcoding was tested.
   Moreover, threshold choice (a controversial issue in barcoding studies)
   was also explored in a new way, by calculating through simulations the
   effect of sampling effort (in species number and species composition) on
   threshold calculations. We found one 200-bp minibarcode region that
   showed the same accuracy as the full-length barcode (602bp) and was
   surrounded by conserved regions potentially useful for group-specific
   degenerate primers. Species identification accuracy was perfect (100\%)
   but decreased when singletons or species of the Proctophyllodes pinnatus
   group were included. In fact, barcoding confirmed previous taxonomic
   issues within the P.pinnatus group. Following an integrative taxonomy
   approach, we compared our barcode study with previous taxonomic
   knowledge on feather mites, discovering three new putative cryptic
   species and validating three previous morphologically different (but
   still undescribed) new species.}},

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{11-23}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Fine-scale landscape features such as scattered trees are increasingly
   thought to be critical for dispersal, and need to be considered in
   connectivity modelling and planning. Yet existing modelling approaches
   struggle to adequately take fine-scale features and threshold dynamics
   of dispersal behaviour into account, in part because of computational
   limitations. We present a framework for modelling connectivity at fine
   spatial resolutions over large spatial extents. Our framework involves a
   novel approach to characterising fine-scale dispersal behaviour within
   the context of existing modelling methods, and uses key parameters of
   dispersal behaviour to link models and their interpretation at multiple
   scales. We address computational limitations by creating a gap-crossing
   threshold layer, which identifies areas where dispersal is possible
   because of the presence and spacing of fine-scale connectivity elements.
   This layer is combined with a dispersal-cost layer within a
   graph-network analysis to identify the optimal least-cost path between
   patches. Graph metrics are used to assess the importance of specific
   patches at the regional-scale and to describe connectivity for the whole
   landscape. A local-scale connectivity model using the Circuitscape
   software complements the regional analysis outputs by considering all
   possible pathways across a landscape simultaneously rather than a single
   least-cost path. The framework was designed specifically to be applied
   by land use planners who need to quantify the impacts of property
   development on fine-scale connectivity, yet need to assess implications
   at the regional scale. We demonstrate the framework by applying it in
   the Lower Hunter region, Australia. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{116-124}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Landscape fragmentation is commonly defined as having five distinct
   phases (perforation, dissection, subdivision, shrinkage, and attrition).
   Previous studies focus on using landscape pattern metrics to interpret
   the phase of the landscape. A critical but underinvestigated aspect is
   that these five phases are also spatially explicit processes. This study
   proposes a new method to map and measure the different spatially
   explicit processes of landscape fragmentation. Unlike previous studies
   that are based on landscape pattern metrics, this current study measures
   landscape change directly. The new method is applied to Bao'an District
   in Shenzhen, China, to investigate forest land fragmentation under rapid
   urbanization. Landsat data were used to map the land use distributions
   from 1978 to 2009. Results show that different spatial processes occur
   simultaneously throughout the study area as well as in different study
   periods of forest fragmentation. Shrinkage was the dominant spatial
   process in the early period. In the later period, subdivision played a
   more important role, followed by attrition. Interestingly, urban land
   was not the leading land use that directly encroached on forest land, as
   many other studies have shown. Instead, forest land was first converted
   to orchard land, and orchard land was converted to urban land. The study
   contributes to Forman's general model of spatially explicit processes of
   landscape fragmentation and holds implications for urban planning policy
   and practice. The study concludes that the new method is effective in
   understanding and assessing forest land fragmentation, especially in the
   context of rapid urbanization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{It is essential to know the spatial distribution of water resources to
   maintain sustainable water use. We present a method for developing a
   simple model of forest evapotranspiration, an essential component of the
   water budget because it controls water loss from the land surface, that
   uses a process-oriented model as a reference to parameterize data from a
   wide range of environmental conditions instead of observed data. Our
   model considers two major forest evapotranspiration processes,
   dry-canopy evapotranspiration and wet-canopy evaporation. Dry-canopy
   evapotranspiration was calculated based on the Priestley-Taylor
   equation. Wet-canopy evaporation assumed a constant interception ratio.
   The accuracy of the model performance was determined in two steps.
   First, we compared the new model with a reference model using
   meteorological data other than those used in model parameterization.
   Then, we compared evapotranspiration data based on the annual water
   budget method for 25 forest sites with data based on the short-term
   water budget method for eight forest sites in japan. The model
   successfully reproduced both the geographical and seasonal patterns of
   forest evapotranspiration over Japan. The model has a simple structure
   and requires few meteorological inputs compared with process-oriented
   models, and it is therefore considered suitable for regional-scale
   application. The model has the potential to be incorporated into other
   monthly forest ecosystem models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   linkages. It operates in a non-equilibrium, alternative states
   framework, at the landscape scale, and in response to changing
   environmental, economic and social conditions. Progress has been marked
   by conceptual advances in the fields of trait-environment relationships,
   community assembly, and understanding the links between biodiversity and
   ecosystem functioning. Conceptual and practical advances have been
   enhanced by applying evolving technologies, including treatments to
   increase seed germination and overcome recruitment bottlenecks, high
   throughput DNA sequencing to elucidate soil community structure and
   function, and advances in satellite technology and GPS tracking to
   monitor habitat use. The synthesis of these technologies with systematic
   reviews of context dependencies in restoration success, model based
   analyses and consideration of complex socio-ecological systems will
   allow generalizations to inform evidence based interventions. Ongoing
   challenges include setting realistic, socially acceptable goals for
   restoration under changing environmental conditions, and prioritizing
   actions in an increasingly space-competitive world. Ethical questions
   also surround the use of genetically modified material, translocations,
   taxon substitutions, and de-extinction, in restoration ecology.
   Addressing these issues, as the Ecological Society of America looks to
   its next century, will require current and future generations of
   researchers and practitioners, including economists, engineers,
   philosophers, landscape architects, social scientists and restoration
   ecologists, to work together with communities and governments to rise to
   the environmental challenges of the coming decades.}},

Title = {{A structured war-gaming framework for managing extreme risks}},

Pages = {{369-377}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Extreme risks are challenging to learn from, prepare for and protect
   against, and they invite the development of new approaches to complement
   existing methods of risk management. We describe a systematic ex ante
   approach to support the strategic preparedness of risk management and
   apply it to a biosecurity case study. Our framework integrates a
   war-game model and a structured decision making approach. The model
   provides interactive maps that help stakeholders in visualizing the
   economic impacts of the extreme risk under different management
   scenarios, and it facilitates adaptive management by translating
   science-based results into stakeholder perspectives. The structured
   decision making approach not only offers an analytical structure to
   organize the multiple objectives of risk management, but also functions
   as a platform for group deliberation among alternative courses of
   management action with uncertain consequences. We found that this
   integration helped stakeholders develop a better understanding of the
   complexities and interconnectedness of the extreme risk management and
   reached a consensus regarding the most preferred management option.

Abstract = {{The white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatica) serves an important ecological
   role as a diurnal pollinator of the saguaro cactus in the Sonoran desert
   and an economic role as a highly sought after game bird in North
   America. White-winged doves are intimately linked to anthropogenic
   changes on the landscape and because of this, have experienced dramatic
   population fluctuations over the last 75 years in response, both
   positively and negatively, to anthropogenic changes on the landscape. To
   understand the factors driving population growth and decline of
   migratory species like the white-winged dove, it is imperative we study
   resource use on both their breeding and wintering grounds. To understand
   how populations are distributed on the wintering grounds, we tested an
   alternative to band recovery approaches by using stable isotope
   analysis. Before we could use isotope analysis to link breeding and
   wintering locations for this species, we first needed to determine if
   hydrogen (H-2) and carbon (C-13) stable isotopes in feather tissue
   (H-2(f) and C-13(f), respectively) could differentiate among populations
   of white-winged doves across their breeding range in Texas, New Mexico,
   and Arizona. H-2(f) and C-13(f) not only differentiated between
   populations of white-winged doves that breed in the United States, but
   H-2(f) also provided further differentiation in white-winged doves that
   breed in native Sonoran Desert and agricultural habitats in the western
   portion of their range. Ecological processes associated with desert
   resources and anthropogenic influences, specifically saguaro cacti and
   irrigated crops, largely determined H-2(f) in some white-winged doves in
   Arizona whereas H-2 of precipitation (H-2(p)) largely determined H-2(f)
   of doves in New Mexico and Texas. This study highlights the usefulness
   of stable isotope analysis to differentiate populations of animals
   across the landscape and the insight isotopes can provide into habitat
   and resource use. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{969-977}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Indigenous peoples globally have relied on customary practices for
   safeguarding and optimizing harvest of wildlife populations, including
   seabirds. Increasingly, there have been efforts to engage these
   indigenous and local knowledge systems to inform responses to the global
   biodiversity crisis. We considered how customary harvest management as
   practiced historically by New Zealand Maori might have contributed to
   sustaining a burrowing seabird population. We used a deterministic
   age-structured model of a population of grey-faced petrels (Pterodroma
   gouldi). By harvesting pre-fledging chicks, rather than adult birds,
   Maori harvesters had less of an impact on population growth rates;
   annual population growth rate dropped below 1.0 if 2\% or more of adult
   birds were harvested compared with threshold harvests of 25\% or more of
   either eggs or chicks. Restrictions such as prohibition of the digging
   out of burrows or the use of a snaring pole to catch chicks would lead
   to an annual harvest of less than our estimated deterministic threshold
   for a sustainable harvest of 25\% of chicks even if all the chicks
   within arm's reach down the burrows were caught. The cultural practice
   of rotating harvests or resting populations was also effective;
   harvesting every 3 years allowed up to 75\% of chicks to be taken
   without causing the theoretical population to decline. The development
   and implementation of ecologically meaningful but also culturally
   appropriate approaches to managing wildlife is an important part of
   efforts to de-colonialize conservation management. We recommend adaptive
   or multi-evidence-based approaches where scientific information and
   methods complement indigenous knowledge and practices in the management
   of wildlife. (c) 2015 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions are a prominent factor contributing to global
   biodiversity loss. As a result, managing invasive species is a priority
   for many conservation scientists and natural resource managers. Invasive
   species management requires a multidisciplinary approach and there is
   increasing recognition that physiology can be used to inform
   conservation efforts because physiological processes underlie an
   individual's response to its environment. For example, physiological
   concepts and tools can be used to assess the impacts of invasive animals
   on their new ecosystems, to predict which animal species are likely to
   become invasive, to prevent the introduction of non-native animals, and
   to control incipient or established invasions. To evaluate whether
   physiology is integrated within invasion science, the journal Biological
   Invasions was surveyed for a quantitative literature review. To
   determine how physiology is used to inform invasion science and which
   subdisciplines of physiology are particularly relevant to invasive
   animal management, the broader invasion literature was also reviewed to
   identify examples where physiology has contributed to studying and
   managing invasive animals. Only 6 \% of articles published in Biological
   Invasions incorporated physiological knowledge or tools, mostly for the
   purposes of identifying traits associated with species invasiveness
   (i.e. prediction). However, the broader literature indicated that
   successful invasive species research and management can be supported by
   fundamental and applied physiological research for assessing,
   predicting, preventing, and controlling invasive animals. Development of
   new techniques and increased availability of equipment for remote or
   rapid monitoring of physiology in the field will increase opportunities
   for integrating physiology within invasion science.}},

Abstract = {{Territorial user rights for fisheries are being promoted to enhance the
   sustainability of small-scale fisheries. Using Chile as a case study, we
   designed a market-based program aimed at improving fishers' livelihoods
   while incentivizing the establishment and enforcement of no-take areas
   within areas managed with territorial user right regimes. Building on
   explicit enabling conditions (i.e., high levels of governance,
   participation, and empowerment), we used a place-based, human-centered
   approach to design a program that will have the necessary support and
   buy-in from local fishers to result in landscape-scale biodiversity
   benefits. Transactional infrastructure must be complex enough to capture
   the biodiversity benefits being created, but simple enough so that the
   program can be scaled up and is attractive to potential financiers.
   Biodiversity benefits created must be commoditized, and desired
   behavioral changes must be verified within a transactional context.
   Demand must be generated for fisher-created biodiversity benefits in
   order to attract financing and to scale the market model. Important
   design decisions around these 3 componentssupply, transactional
   infrastructure, and demandmust be made based on local social-ecological
   conditions. Our market model, which is being piloted in Chile, is a

   Resumen Los derechos de uso territorial en las pesquerias estan siendo
   promovidos para mejorar la sustentabilidad de las pesquerias a pequena
   escala. Utilizando a Chile como estudio de caso, disenamos un programa
   con base en el mercado para mejorar el sustento de los pescadores a la
   vez que se incentiva el establecimiento y la aplicacion de areas de
   reserva sin pesca dentro de areas manejadas por regimenes de derechos de
   uso territorial. Usamos una estrategia de diseno antropocentrico basada
   en condiciones explicitas del lugar (es decir, altos niveles de
   gobernanza, participacion y empoderamiento) para disenar un programa que
   tenga el apoyo y la aceptacion necesarios por parte de los pescadores
   locales y que resulte en beneficios para la biodiversidad a escala de
   paisaje. La infraestructura transaccional debe ser lo suficientemente
   compleja para capturar estos beneficios durante su creacion, pero lo
   suficientemente simple para que el programa pueda subir de escala y sea
   atractivo para los financiadores potenciales. Los beneficios creados
   deben ser un bien transable, y los cambios conductuales deseados deben
   verificarse dentro de un contexto transaccional. La demanda debe
   generarse para los beneficios de biodiversidad creados para asi poder
   atraer financiamiento y mantener a escala el modelo de mercado. Se deben
   tomar decisiones importantes de diseno alrededor de tres componentes -
   suministro, infraestructura transaccional y demanda- con base en las
   condiciones socio-ecologicas locales. Nuestro modelo de mercado, que
   esta en etapa de prueba piloto en Chile, es un cimiento flexible sobre
   el cual se pueden basar oportunidades expandibles para volver

Abstract = {{As threats to biodiversity from environmental change increase, assessing
   priorities for mitigation action becomes increasingly important.
   However, there have been few attempts to schedule actions across broad
   spatial extents that explicitly account for dynamic ecological processes
   and threats. We combined a dynamic occupancy model with a decision
   analysis framework to spatially allocate multiple recovery actions to
   maximize species' probability of occupancy under threats posed by
   climate and land-use change. We used the koala Phascolarctos cinereus
   across the Australian state of New South Wales (810000km(2)) to
   illustrate this approach. We considered four actions implemented on a
   10x10km(2) grid: reduce domestic dog attacks through dog control, reduce
   vehicle collisions through fencing highways, protect habitat through
   land acquisitions and restore Eucalyptus forest. We used the occupancy
   model to predict ecological responses to recovery actions and simulated
   annealing to identify spatio-temporal priorities for each action. We
   contrasted the results against priorities generated using a traditional
   static distribution model. To maximize the probability of koala
   occupancy in 50years' time, with an annual budget of up to
   AU\$20million, investment priorities were located in the eastern part of
   koala's range, focusing on dog control with some investment in habitat
   protection and restoration. With higher budgets, investment priorities
   shifted towards habitat protection and restoration in the western part
   of the range. However, priorities based on the static distribution
   model, which had a lower predictive accuracy than the dynamic model,
   were different. Regardless of budget, priorities derived from the static
   model were predominantly located in the western part of koala's range,
   focusing on highway fencing with some investment in dog
   control.Synthesis and applications. Our approach for integrating
   spatio-temporal dynamics into conservation prioritization across broad
   spatial extents provides a significant advance on existing approaches
   based on static distribution models. The finding that the inferior
   static model produced different priorities to the dynamic model cautions
   against the use of static models for conservation planning in dynamic
   landscapes. Additionally, the substantial changes in priorities with
   budget indicate that conservation planning under dynamic landscape and
   climate change must carefully consider priority actions and locations
   relative to the conservation resources available.

Title = {{A benchmarking and assessment framework to operationalise ecological
   indicators based on time series analysis}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{94-106}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The call for ecosystem considerations in marine management has
   instigated the use of ecosystem indicators. Many ecosystem indicators
   have been suggested under new policy frameworks such as the EU Marine
   Strategy Framework Directive or the Common Fisheries Policy. But many of
   these indicators are still under development and cannot be considered as
   yet operational for environmental assessments. A common reason for this
   lack of operationability is the absence of valid assessment benchmarks.
   This study introduces a two-stage approach for the benchmarking and
   assessment of time series (TSBA) against a priori chosen rationale of
   improvement or maintenance of current conditions. TSBA uses breakpoint-
   and trend-analysis to obtain long-term benchmarks and assess short term
   progress. Depending on the outcome of both analyses the action
   requirements for management can be determined:The method is exemplified
   on a case study on the size-structure of large North Sea gadoid stocks,
   which are considered as being sensitive to the impacts of fishing. Three
   out of six stocks reached their assessment benchmarks, while the three
   other stocks failed. TSBA is generic and can be applied to any indicator
   used within any marine policy assessment framework. A
   strength-weaknesses-opportunity-threat analysis (SWOT) investigated the
   advantages and disadvantages of TSBA in the context of the currently
   high political demand of operational ecosystem indicators. Contrary to
   benchmarks derived from ecological concepts or pressure-state
   relationship TSBA benchmarks are not specifically linked to limits of
   resilience or sustainability. However, TSBA may be especially useful in
   situations where assessment benchmarks from other sources will not be
   readily available or are associated with high uncertainty. (C) 2015

Title = {{Mismatches between ecosystem services supply and demand in urban areas:
   A quantitative assessment in five European cities}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{146-158}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Assessing mismatches between ecosystem service (ES) supply and demand
   can provide relevant insights for enhancing human well-being in urban
   areas. This paper provides a novel methodological approach to assess
   regulating ES mismatches on the basis of environmental quality standards
   and policy goals. Environmental quality standards (EQS) indicate the
   relationship between environmental quality and human well-being. Thus,
   they can be used as a common minimum threshold value to determine
   whether the difference between ES supply and demand is problematic for
   human well-being. The methodological approach includes three main steps:
   (1) selection of EQS, (2) definition and quantification of ES supply and
   demand indicators, and (3) identification and assessment of ES
   mismatches on the basis of EQS considering certain additional criteria.
   While ES supply indicators estimate the flow of an ES actually used or
   delivered, ES demand indicators express the amount of regulation needed
   in relation to the standard. The approach is applied to a case study
   consisting of five European cities: Barcelona, Berlin, Stockholm,
   Rotterdam and Salzburg, considering three regulating ES which are
   relevant in urban areas: air purification, global climate regulation and
   urban temperature regulation. The results show that levels of ES supply
   and demand are highly heterogeneous across the five studied cities and
   across the EQS considered. The assessment shows that ES supply
   contributes very moderately in relation to the compliance with the EQS
   in most part of the identified mismatches. Therefore, this research
   suggests that regulating ES supplied by urban green infrastructure are
   expected to play only a minor or complementary role to other urban
   policies intended to abate air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions at
   the city scale. The approach has revealed to be appropriate for the
   regulating ES air purification and global climate regulation, for which
   well-established standards or targets are available at the city level.
   Yet, its applicability to the ES urban temperature regulation has proved
   more problematic due to scale and user dependent constraints. (C) 2015

   treatment-seeking behaviours between the Vaidya's patients and community
   members}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study aimed at exploring the roles of a Vaidya - an
   uncodified traditional doctor - in a community in Kerala State, India.
   Special attention was paid to the characteristics of the Vaidya's
   patients in comparison with the treatment-seeking behaviour of the
   community members.
   Methods: Both qualitative and quantitative data about the Vaidya, 97 of
   his patients, and 31 community members were gathered via participatory
   fieldwork and open-ended interviews.
   Results: It was found that the community members seldom consulted the
   Vaidya who lived in their community; thus, the role of the Vaidya as the
   community's primary health care provider had nearly disappeared.
   Nonetheless, the Vaidya was deeply respected as one of the community's
   leaders by its members because of the spiritual and financial support he
   provided to them. On the other hand, a number of patients visited the
   Vaidya from outside the village, which implied that the Vaidya played a
   new role under the changes caused by medical pluralism. Even a codified
   traditional medicine, Ayurveda, was less popular among the community
   members. These findings were interesting, because while the traditional
   Indian medical system has been becoming popular and common in other
   societies, such as European societies, as an alternative medicine, the
   traditional medical system was becoming less important in the rural
   Indian context.

Abstract = {{Macroevolution, encompassing the deep-time patterns of the origins of
   modern biodiversity, has been discussed in many contexts. Non-Darwinian
   models such as macromutations have been proposed as a means of bridging
   seemingly large gaps in knowledge, or as a means to explain the origin
   of exquisitely adapted body plans. However, such gaps can be spanned by
   new fossil finds, and complex, integrated organisms can be shown to have
   evolved piecemeal. For example, the fossil record between dinosaurs and
   Archaeopteryx has now filled up with astonishing fossil intermediates
   that show how the unique plexus of avian adaptations emerged step by
   step over 60 Myr. New numerical approaches to morphometrics and
   phylogenetic comparative methods allow palaeontologists and biologists
   to work together on deep-time questions of evolution, to explore how
   diversity, morphology and function have changed through time. Patterns
   are more complex than sometimes expected, with frequent decoupling of
   species diversity and morphological diversity, pointing to the need for
   some new generalizations about the processes that lie behind such
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial invasive plants are a global problem and are becoming
   ubiquitous components of most ecosystems. They are implicated in
   altering disturbance regimes, reducing biodiversity, and changing
   ecosystem function, sometimes in profound and irreversible ways.
   However, the ecological impacts of most invasive plants have not been
   studied experimentally, and most research to date focuses on few types
   of impacts, which can vary greatly among studies. Thus, our knowledge of
   existing ecological impacts ascribed to invasive plants is surprisingly
   limited in both breadth and depth. Our aim was to propose a standard
   methodology for quantifying baseline ecological impact that, in theory,
   is scalable to any terrestrial plant invader (e.g., annual grasses to
   trees) and any invaded system (e.g., grassland to forest). The Global
   Invader Impact Network (GIIN) is a coordinated distributed experiment
   composed of an observational and manipulative methodology. The protocol
   consists of a series of plots located in (1) an invaded area; (2) an
   adjacent removal treatment within the invaded area; and (3) a spatially
   separate uninvaded area thought to be similar to pre-invasion conditions
   of the invaded area. A standardized and inexpensive suite of community,
   soil, and ecosystem metrics are collected allowing broad comparisons
   among measurements, populations, and species. The method allows for
   one-time comparisons and for long-term monitoring enabling one to derive
   information about change due to invasion over time. Invader removal
   plots will also allow for quantification of legacy effects and their
   return rates, which will be monitored for several years. GIIN uses a
   nested hierarchical scale approach encompassing multiple sites, regions,
   and continents. Currently, GIIN has network members in six countries,
   with new members encouraged. To date, study species include
   representatives of annual and perennial grasses; annual and perennial
   forbs; shrubs; and trees. The goal of the GIIN framework is to create a
   standard yet flexible platform for understanding the ecological impacts
   of invasive plants, allowing both individual and synthetic analyses
   across a range of taxa and ecosystems. If broadly adopted, this standard
   approach will offer unique insight into the ecological impacts of
   invasive plants at local, regional, and global scales.}},

Abstract = {{Migration is a primary force of biological evolution that alters allele

   Recent migration has been proposed as the cause of the emergence of many
   infectious diseases, including those carried by blacklegged ticks in
   North America. Populations of blacklegged ticks have established and
   flourished in areas of North America previously thought to be devoid of
   this species. The recent discovery of these populations of blacklegged
   ticks may have resulted from either in situ growth of long-established
   populations that were maintained at very low densities or by migration
   and colonization from established populations. These alternative
   evolutionary hypotheses were investigated using Bayesian phylogeographic
   approaches to infer the origin and migratory history of recently
   detected blacklegged tick populations in the Northeastern United States.
   The data and results indicate that newly detected tick populations are
   not the product of in situ population growth from a previously
   established population but from recent colonization resulting in a
   geographic range expansion. This expansion in the geographic range
   proceeded primarily through progressive and local migration events from
   southern populations to proximate northern locations although
   long-distance migration events were also detected.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife damage compensation schemes have been used worldwide as a
   mechanism to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts. These have had mixed
   success due to a number of factors, including a lack of shared
   understanding of the problem and how to monitor and evaluate
   effectiveness. The long history of damage-causing animals (DCAs) which
   exit the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, inflicting damage on
   persons and property, increasing risk of disease transfer between
   wildlife and livestock, and seriously undermining the livelihoods of
   local communities, remains a contentious issue. As a partial response
   and within a strategic adaptive management framework, the park and its
   larger governing body, SANParks, have negotiated a wildlife damage
   compensation scheme with local communities, which entails financial
   retribution given to farmers who have previously lost livestock to DCAs
   originating from the park. A corollary scheme will see compensation paid
   to valid claims commencing from 2014. Here we present findings of a
   novel study undertaken with KNP staff, livestock farmers, and others to
   co-identify potential indicators of an objective-based participatory
   monitoring and evaluation program for the scheme. Based on a
   multi-method approach, a wide array of goals and objectives were
   articulated for the scheme. In addition, 88 program indicators were
   generated as potential measures to monitor change. This suite of
   indicators is both qualitative and quantitative in nature and, if
   adopted in whole or in part, would enlist the involvement of a broad

Abstract = {{When setting water quality criteria, managers must choose thresholds for
   stressors that are protective of aquatic biodiversity. Setting such
   thresholds requires making implicit judgments about the degree of
   biodiversity loss that managers are willing to accept. We present a new
   modelling approach, the hierarchical diversity decision framework
   (HiDDeF) that explicitly communicates the sensitivity of water quality
   benchmarks to these implicit judgments. We apply HiDDeF to a data set of
   stream macroinvertebrate abundances across 218 sites in south-western
   West Virginia, USA, where alkaline mine drainage increases streamwater
   conductivity and leads to the loss of sensitive taxa throughout regional
   river networks. By integrating responses of individual taxa within a
   flexible hierarchical framework, HiDDeF reliably predicts
   macroinvertebrate assemblages across the full range of conductivities
   observed in the training data set but requires only a fraction (similar
   to 10\%) of the sites required in previous studies. HiDDeF results
   suggest that the current conductivity benchmark (300Scm(-1)) for
   regional streams translates to 50\% loss in abundance for at least
   one-quarter of regional macroinvertebrate taxa. HiDDeF produces a
   decision landscape' that allows decision-makers to assess sensitivity of
   proposed benchmarks to their choice of protective level. HiDDeF allows
   users to investigate both individual- and community-level responses to
   environmental gradients and generates output that includes a
   comprehensive summary of uncertainty in model parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Based on detection of hepatic residues, scavenging and predatory
   non-target raptors are widely exposed to second generation anticoagulant
   rodenticides (SGARs). A small proportion, generally < 10 \%, of tested
   birds are diagnosed as acutely poisoned. Little is known, however, of
   sub-lethal effects of SGARs, such as interaction of clotting capacity
   with traumatic injury. Assessment of coagulation function of birds
   submitted live to wildlife rehabilitators or veterinarians may provide a
   means of establishing the proportion of animals suffering sub-lethal
   coagulopathies, as well as identifying individuals requiring treatment.
   As a first step in exploring the potential of this approach, we dosed
   Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) with the SGAR, brodifacoum, at 0,
   0.8, 1.4, 1.9, and 2.5 mg/kg and sampled birds at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days
   post-dosing. Prothrombin time (PT), which measures the extrinsic
   coagulation pathway, was significantly prolonged in 98 \% of
   brodifacoum-exposed quail in a dose- and time-dependent manner. 50-fold
   prolongation of PT occurred at higher brodifacoum dosages and correlated
   to hemorrhage found at necropsy. Activated clotting time (ACT), a
   measure of the intrinsic pathway also increased with dose and time.
   Hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) decreased dose- and
   time-dependently at doses a parts per thousand yen1.4 mg/kg with no
   significant change at 0.8 mg/kg. Reference intervals for PT (10.0-16.2
   s), ACT (30-180 s), Hb (9.6-18.4 g/dl), and Hct (34-55 \%) were
   established in Japanese quail. Species-specific reference intervals are
   required as barn owl PT (17-29 s) and quail PT were different. The
   proportion of brodifacoum-exposed quail with hemorrhage was not
   correlated with liver residues, but was correlated with PT, suggesting
   that this assay is a useful indicator of avian anticoagulant rodenticide
   exposure. PTs measured in free-living barn owls sampled between April
   2009 and August 2010 in the lower Fraser Valley of BC do not suggest
   significant exposure to SGARs.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsAs biodiversity losses increase due to global change and

   traits and ecosystem properties can provide a new level of understanding
   ecosystem complexity. Using a functional response-effect approach, we
   show that multiple components of the carbon cycle are determined by a
   few plant traits, which in turn are strongly affected by environmental
   conditions.
   LocationSalt marshes, northwest Germany.
   MethodsWe explored responses of morphological, chemical and
   biomass-related plant traits to environmental drivers and examined their
   effects on carbon cycle properties, i.e. above-ground biomass,
   above-ground net primary productivity and decomposition. The combined
   analysis between environmental parameters, functional traits and
   ecosystem properties used structural equation modelling (SEM).
   ResultsImportant response and effect traits were leaf dry matter content
   (LDMC) and below-ground dry mass (BDM, responding to groundwater level
   and salinity) and leaf C:N ratio (responding to inundation frequency).
   Inundation and salinity led to increased allocation to below-ground
   biomass and salt stress adaptation in leaves, which translated into
   increased decomposition rates. Release from these abiotic controls
   resulted in standing biomass accumulation, which was controlled by LDMC
   and canopy height as key traits.
   ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate the interacting effects of
   non-consumable environmental factors and soil resources on
   morphological, chemical and biomass traits, which affected carbon cycle
   properties. Loss of species from the community has the potential to
   change the relationships between environment and vegetation-based

Abstract = {{Changing aspen distribution in response to climate change and fire is a
   major focus of biodiversity conservation, yet little is known about the
   potential response of aspen to these two driving forces along
   topoclimatic gradients.
   This study is set to evaluate how aspen distribution might shift in
   response to different climate-fire scenarios in a semi-arid montane
   landscape, and quantify the influence of fire regime along topoclimatic
   gradients.
   We used a novel integration of a forest landscape succession and
   disturbance model (LANDIS-II) with a fine-scale climatic water deficit
   approach to simulate dynamics of aspen and associated conifer and shrub
   species over the next 150 years under various climate-fire scenarios.
   Simulations suggest that many aspen stands could persist without fire
   for centuries under current climate conditions. However, a simulated 2-5
   A degrees C increase in temperature caused a substantial reduction of
   aspen coverage at lower elevations and a modest increase at upper
   elevations, leading to an overall reduction of aspen range at the
   landscape level. Increasing fire activity may favor aspen increase at
   its upper elevation limits adjacent to coniferous forest, but may also
   favor reduction of aspen at lower elevation limits adjacent to xeric
   shrubland.
   Our study highlights the importance of incorporating fine-scale terrain
   effects on climatic water deficit and ecohydrology when modeling species
   distribution response to climate change. This modeling study suggests
   that climate mitigation and adaptation strategies that use fire would
   benefit from consideration of spatial context at landscape scales.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in geospatial technology have brought new methods

Abstract = {{Performance-based payments are widely seen as a promising tool for
   Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) in
   tropical forests. Despite great advances in international REDD+
   negotiations, there is a lack of consensus around the development of
   business-as-usual (BAU) reference scenarios or baselines to derive and
   quantify net carbon emission reductions. In this paper, we explore a
   novel approach for developing baselines (point forecasts) using
   exponential smoothing. Further, we introduce the concept of
   probabilistic BAU scenario ranges developed using this approach.
   We compare predictive performance with the linear trend and historical
   averages approaches conventionally used in policy proposals and REDD+
   pilots. Weempirically test the relative performance of all three
   approaches by forecasting BAU baselines and scenario ranges in 36 sites
   (consisting of 20 countries and 8 Amazonian states with and 8 countries
   without REDD+ schemes). Based on two predictive performance measures
   (the root mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error), we
   find that exponential smoothing outperforms the linear trend and
   historical average models at predicting forest cover changes. In
   addition, we show how prediction intervals based on a desired confidence
   level generated through exponential smoothing can be used in novel ways
   to determine likely baseline scenario ranges. In this way it is possible
   to quantify the degree of variability and uncertainty in datasets.
   Importantly, this also provides a statistical measure of confidence to
   determine if REDD+ interventions have been effective.
   By generating robust probabilistic baseline scenarios, exponential
   smoothing models can facilitate the effectiveness of REDD+ payments,

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose novel epidemic models (named,
   susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible-bacteria) for cholera
   dynamics by incorporating a general formulation of bacteria growth and
   spatial variation. In the first part, a generalized ordinary
   differential equation (ODE) model is presented and it is found that
   bacterial growth contributes to the increase in the basic reproduction

   the derived basic reproduction number, we analyse the local and global
   dynamics of the model. Particularly, we give a rigorous proof on the
   endemic global stability by employing the geometric approach. In the
   second part, we extend the ODE model to a partial differential equation
   (PDE) model with the inclusion of diffusion to capture the movement of
   human hosts and bacteria in a heterogeneous environment. The disease
   threshold of this PDE model is studied again by using the basic
   reproduction number. The results on the threshold dynamics of the ODE
   and PDE models are compared, and verified through numerical simulation.
   Additionally, our analysis shows that incorporating diffusive spatial

Abstract = {{In order to better regionalize and discuss the rationality/irrationality
   of the spatial patterns China' food provision, food production and
   population data was collected and GIS spatial analysis and modeling
   methods were used. Multi-level spatial analysis and contrast between
   North and South China was carried out from three aspects: (1) Ecosystem
   food provision potential (EFPP). Step-by-step-modifying models were
   constructed to assess EFPP, parameters including solar radiation,
   temperature, humidity, topography, soil, and landuse. (2) Conversion
   ratio of the EFPP (CRFP), representing the ratio of actual food
   production to the EFPP. High EFPP and low CRFP means high remaining food
   potential for future exploration (or protecting, increasing). (3)
   Population pressure of food provision (PPFP). PPFP was calculated based
   on food production, population, nutrition ingredient, and consumption
   standards. High PPFP means food deficiency. Results: (I) The EFPP in
   South and Southeast China is much higher than in the North regions,
   while the CRFP is the opposite; this means the South and Southeast China
   has more remaining food potential to explore (or to protect). CRFP in
   Northeast China is the highest (81\%), indicating the food provision in
   Northeast China is approaching its maximum potential. In the future it
   is not wise to rely solely on food provision increases in North China,
   which may aggravate some problems like water shortage and ecosystem
   deterioration. (2) PPFP in the South and Southeast of China is much
   greater than in the North and has been rising, indicating that South and
   Southeast China have deficiency in food supply and is more and more
   dependent on food transportation from North China. It is necessary to
   preserve the fertile and high-yielding croplands as well as reclaim new
   food resources in the southern and eastern to improve its food
   self-sufficiency. From the above results, we can derive that the ``North
   Grain to South{''} (NGS) pattern of China is irrational. This is in
   opposition to the present pattern of NGS but consistent with some other

Abstract = {{The giant squid (Architeuthis) has been reported since even before the
   16th century, and has recently been observed live in its habitat for the
   first time. Among the species belonging to this genus,Architeuthis dux
   has received special attention from biologists. The distribution of this
   species is poorly understood, as most of our information stems from
   stranded animals or stomach remains. Predicting the habitat and
   distribution of this species, and more in general of difficult to
   observe species, is important from a biological conservation
   perspective. In this paper, we present an approach to estimate the
   potential distribution of A. dux at global scale, with relative high
   resolution (1-degree). Our approach relies on a complex preparation
   phase, which improves the reliability of presence, absence and
   environmental data correlated to the species habitat. We compare our
   distribution with those produced by state-of-the-art approaches (MaxEnt
   and AquaMaps), and use an expert-drawn map as reference. We demonstrate
   that our model projection is in agreement with the expert's map and is
   also compliant with-several biological assessments of the species
   habitat and with recent observations. Furthermore, we show that our
   approach can be generalized as a paradigm that is applicable to other

   obtained from cattle and badger populations includes within-host
   reproduction numbers close to 1 and between-host reproduction numbers of

   reducing cattle-to-cattle transmission is essential. In some regions,
   even large reductions in badger prevalence can have a modest impact on
   cattle infection and a multi-stranded approach is necessary that also
   targets badger-to-cattle transmission directly. The new perspective

Abstract = {{Determining where biodiversity is likely to be most vulnerable to

   first steps to incorporate climate change into biodiversity management
   plans. Here, we use a spatial climate change vulnerability assessment to
   (1) map the potential vulnerability of terrestrial biodiversity to
   climate change in the northeastern United States and (2) provide
   guidance on how and where management actions for biodiversity could
   provide long-term benefits under climate change (i.e., climate-smart
   management considerations). Our model suggests that biodiversity will be
   most vulnerable in Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia due
   to the combination of high climate change velocity, high landscape
   resistance, and high topoclimate homogeneity. Biodiversity is predicted
   to be least vulnerable in Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire because
   large portions of these states have low landscape resistance, low
   climate change velocity, and low topoclimate homogeneity. Our spatial
   climate-smart management considerations suggest that: (1) high
   topoclimate diversity could moderate the effects of climate change
   across 50\% of the region; (2) decreasing local landscape resistance in
   conjunction with other management actions could increase the benefit of
   those actions across 17\% of the region; and (3) management actions
   across 24\% of the region could provide long-term benefits by promoting
   short-term population persistence that provides a source population
   capable of moving in the future. The guidance and framework we provide

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The effect of anthropogenic climate change on organisms will likely be
   related to climate change exposure and velocity at local and regional
   scales. However, common methods to estimate climate change exposure and
   velocity ignore important components of climate that are known to affect
   the ecology and evolution of organisms. We develop a novel index of
   climate change (climate overlap) that simultaneously estimates changes
   in the means, variation and correlation between multiple weather
   variables. Specifically, we estimate the overlap between multivariate
   normal probability distributions representing historical and current or
   projected future climates. We provide methods for estimating the
   statistical significance of climate overlap values and methods to
   estimate velocity using climate overlap. We show that climates have
   changed significantly across 80\% of the continental United States in
   the last 32 years and that much of this change is due to changes in the
   variation and correlation between weather variables (two statistics that
   are rarely incorporated into climate change studies). We also show that
   projected future temperatures are predicted to be locally novel (<15\%
   overlap) across most of the global land surface and that exposure is
   likely to be highest in areas with low historical climate variation.
   Last, we show that accounting for changes in the variation and
   correlation between multiple weather variables can dramatically affect
   velocity estimates; mean velocity estimates in the continental United
   States were between 31 and 190kmyr(-1) when estimated using climate
   overlap compared to 14kmyr(-1) when estimated using traditional methods.
   Our results suggest that accounting for changes in the means, variation
   and correlation between multiple weather variables can dramatically
   affect estimates of climate change exposure and velocity. These climate
   components are known to affect the ecology and evolution of organisms,
   but are ignored by most measures of climate change. We conclude with a
   set of future directions and recommend future work to determine which
   measures of climate change exposure and velocity are most related to
   biological responses to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Eukaryotic microbes comprise a diverse collection of phototrophic and
   heterotrophic creatures known to play fundamental roles in ecological
   processes. Some can be identified by light microscopy, generally the
   largest and with conspicuous shapes, while the smallest can be counted
   by epifluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry but remain largely
   unidentified. Microbial diversity studies greatly advanced with the
   analysis of phylogenetic markers sequenced from natural assemblages.
   Molecular surveys began in 1990 targeting marine bacterioplankton
   (Giovannoni etal. ) and first approached microbial eukaryotes in three
   studies published in 2001 (Diez etal. ; Lopez-Garcia etal. ; Moon-van
   der Staay etal. ). These seminal studies, based on cloning and Sanger
   sequencing the complete 18S rDNA, were critical for obtaining broad
   pictures of microbial diversity in contrasted habitats and for
   describing novel lineages by robust phylogenies, but were limited by the
   number of sequences obtained. So, inventories of species richness in a
   given sample and community comparisons through environmental gradients
   were very incomplete. These limitations have been overcome with the
   advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods, initially
   454-pyrosequencing, today Illumina and soon others to come. In this
   issue of Molecular Ecology, Egge etal. () show a nice example of the use
   of HTS to study the biodiversity and seasonal succession of a
   particularly important group of marine microbial eukaryotes, the
   haptophytes. Temporal changes were analysed first at the community
   level, then at the clade level, and finally at the lowest rank
   comparable to species. Interesting and useful ecological insights were
   obtained at each taxonomic scale. Haptophyte diversity differed along
   seasons in a systematic manner, with some species showing seasonal
   preferences and others being always present. Many of these species had
   no correspondence with known species, pointing out the high level of
   novelty in microbial assemblages, only accessible by molecular tools.
   Moreover, the number of species detected was limited, agreeing with a
   putative scenario of constrained evolutionary diversification in
   free-living small eukaryotes. This study illustrates the potential of
   HTS to address ecological relevant questions in an accessible way by
   processing large data sets that, nonetheless, need to be treated with a
   fair understanding of their limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrozoa of the Mediterranean Sea are well known and a recent monograph
   covers 457 species. Mediterranean non-Siphonophoran Hydrozoa comprises
   398 species, an increasing number due to continuous updates,
   representing about 10 \% of the 3,702 currently valid species reported
   in a recent world assessment of hydrozoan diversity. Many new records
   are non indigenous species, previously described species that occurred
   elsewhere and whose arrival was presumably caused by human activities.
   However, many species reported in the past are not recorded in recent
   times. Realistic assessments of species pools require addition of new
   species, but also subtraction of species not found since a certain
   period. With the confidence of extinction index, cases of putative
   extinction can be raised. Out of the 398 known species, only 162 (41 \%)
   have been reported in the last decade, while 53 (13 \%) are not recorded
   in the literature since at least 41 years. According to the confidence
   of extinction index, 60 \% of the 53 missing species are extinct, and 11
   \% are putatively extinct from the basin. From a biogeographical point
   of view, the missing species are: 34 \% endemic, 19 \% boreal, 15 \%
   Mediterranean-Atlantic, 11 \% Indo-Pacific, 11 \% circumtropical, 4 \%
   cosmopolitan, 2 \% tropical-Atlantic, 4 \% non-classifiable.
   Fluctuations in species composition into a certain area cause heavy
   variability in the expression of both structural and functional
   biodiversity. As consequence, the regional biodiversity should be
   analyzed through its temporal evolution, to detect changes and their
   possible causes. This approach has profound consequences on biodiversity
   assessments and also on the compilation of red lists.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Although recent global warming trends in air temperature are not as
   pronounced as those observed only one decade ago, global mean
   temperature is still at a very high level. Does plant phenology - which
   is believed to be a suitable indicator of climate change - respond in a
   similar way, that is, does it still mirror recent temperature
   variations? We explored in detail long-term flowering onset dates of
   snowdrop, cherry, and lime tree and relevant spring temperatures at
   three sites in Germany (1901-2012) using the Bayesian multiple
   change-point approach. We investigated whether mean spring temperature
   changes were amplified or slowed down in the past decade and how plant
   phenology responded to the most recent temperature changes.
   Incorporating records with different end points (i.e., 2002 and 2012),
   we compared differences in trends and inferred possible differences
   caused by extrapolating phenological and meteorological data. The new
   multiple-change point approach is characterized by an enhanced structure
   and greater flexibility compared to the one change point model. However,
   the highest model probabilities for phenological (meteorological)
   records were still obtained for the one change point (linear) model.
   Marked warming trends in the recent decade were only revealed for mean
   temperatures of March to May, here better described with one or two
   change point models. In the majority of cases analyzed, changes in
   temperatures were well mirrored by phenological changes. However,
   temperatures in March to May were linked to less strongly advancing
   onset dates for lime tree flowering during the period 1901-2012,
   pointing to the likely influence of photoperiodic constraints or
   unfulfilled chilling requirements. Due to the slowdown of temperature
   increase, analyses conducted on records ending in 2002 demonstrated
   distinct differences when compared with records ending in 2012.
   Extrapolation of trends could therefore (along with the choice of the
   statistical method) lead to distinctly different results and most recent
   data should be integrated in order not to over- or underestimate future

Abstract = {{Projected effects of climate change across many ecosystems globally
   include more frequent disturbance by fire and reduced plant growth due
   to warmer (and especially drier) conditions. Such changes affect species
   - particularly fire-intolerant woody plants - by simultaneously reducing
   recruitment, growth, and survival. Collectively, these mechanisms may
   narrow the fire interval window compatible with population persistence,
   driving species to extirpation or extinction. We present a conceptual
   model of these combined effects, based on synthesis of the known impacts
   of climate change and altered fire regimes on plant demography, and
   describe a syndrome we term interval squeeze. This model predicts that
   interval squeeze will increase woody plant extinction risk and change
   ecosystem structure, composition, and carbon storage, especially in
   regions projected to become both warmer and drier. These predicted
   changes demand new approaches to fire management that will maximize the

Abstract = {{The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has
   proposed a standard global assessment protocol for the evaluation of
   conservation risks to ecosystems. The assessment criteria mirror the
   IUCN protocol for the assessment of species, however there are
   relatively few case studies available to demonstrate their utility
   across a broad range of ecosystems. We applied the IUCN protocol to
   assess the conservation status of the Cumberland Plain Woodland (CPW)
   located in the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia. The ecosystem has
   been the focus of extensive survey and research and has been determined
   to be critically endangered under NSW and Australian Government
   legislation, primarily as a consequence of its history of extensive
   clearing. The outcome of the risk assessment for CPW using the IUCN
   protocol was identical to those under the NSW and Australian
   legislation. Data for risk assessment fell into two categories, each
   with different limitations. Phytosocialogical data and distribution
   models provided a strong basis for quantifying past and future changes
   in the distribution of CPW, but offered only indirect measures of
   functional symptoms of decline. Conversely, local case studies
   documenting declines in ecosystem function due to weed invasion, soil
   disturbance and alteration of fire regimes could not easily be
   extrapolated in order to evaluate the assessment criteria. The
   critically endangered rating was based solely on the historic reduction
   in geographic distribution (92-94\%), however clearing poses an ongoing
   threat to the ecosystem. The contemporary clearing rate of CPW is
   approximately half the historical average but there is evidence that the
   rate will double in the next decade as a consequence of ongoing
   urbanisation and Government policy of biodiversity offsets. A systematic
   approach to documenting the extent of environmental degradation and

Abstract = {{Understanding where and when on the landscape fire is likely to burn
   (fire likelihood) and the predicted responses of valued resources (fire
   effects) will lead to more effective management of wildfire risk in
   multiple ecosystem types. Fire is a contagious and highly unpredictable
   process, and an analysis of fire connectivity that incorporates
   stochasticity may help predict fire likelihood across large extents. We
   developed a model of fire connectivity based on electrical circuit
   theory, which is a probabilistic approach to modeling ecological flows.
   We first parameterized our model to reflect the synergistic influences
   of fuels, landscape properties, and winds on fire spread in the lower
   Sonoran Desert of southwestern Arizona, and then defined this landscape
   as an interconnected network through which to model flow (i.e., fire
   spread). We interpreted the mapped outputs as fire likelihood and used
   historical burned area data to evaluate our results. Expected fire
   effects were characterized based on the degree to which future fire
   exposure might negatively impact native plant community recovery, taking
   into account the impact of repeated fire and major vegetation
   associations. We explored fire effects within habitat for the endangered
   Sonoran pronghorn antelope and designated wilderness. Model results
   indicated that fire likelihood was higher in lower elevations, and in
   areas with lower slopes and topographic roughness. Fire likelihood and
   effects were predicted to be high in 21\% of the currently occupied
   range of the Sonoran pronghorn and 15\% of the additional habitat
   considered suitable. Across 16 designated wilderness areas, highest
   predicted fire likelihood and effects fell within low elevation
   wilderness areas that overlapped large fire perimeters that occurred in
   2005. As ongoing changes in climate and land cover are poised to alter
   the fire regime across extensive and ecologically important areas in the
   lower Sonoran Desert, an analysis of fire likelihood and effects can
   contribute new and important information to fire and fuels management.
   Our novel approach to modeling fire connectivity addresses challenges in
   quantifying and communicating wildfire risk and is applicable to other

Abstract = {{In a rapidly changing climate, conservation practitioners could better
   use geodiversity in a broad range of conservation decisions. We explored
   selected avenues through which this integration might improve decision
   making and organized them within the adaptive management cycle of
   assessment, planning, implementation, and monitoring. Geodiversity is
   seldom referenced in predominant environmental law and policy. With most
   natural resource agencies mandated to conserve certain categories of
   species, agency personnel are challenged to find ways to practically
   implement new directives aimed at coping with climate change while
   retaining their species-centered mandate. Ecoregions and ecological
   classifications provide clear mechanisms to consider geodiversity in
   plans or decisions, the inclusion of which will help foster the
   resilience of conservation to climate change. Methods for biodiversity
   assessment, such as gap analysis, climate change vulnerability analysis,
   and ecological process modeling, can readily accommodate inclusion of a
   geophysical component. We adapted others' approaches for characterizing
   landscapes along a continuum of climate change vulnerability for the
   biota they support from resistant, to resilient, to susceptible, and to
   sensitive and then summarized options for integrating geodiversity into
   planning in each landscape type. In landscapes that are relatively
   resistant to climate change, options exist to fully represent
   geodiversity while ensuring that dynamic ecological processes can change
   over time. In more susceptible landscapes, strategies aiming to maintain
   or restore ecosystem resilience and connectivity are paramount.
   Implementing actions on the ground requires understanding of geophysical
   constraints on species and an increasingly nimble approach to
   establishing management and restoration goals. Because decisions that
   are implemented today will be revisited and amended into the future,
   increasingly sophisticated forms of monitoring and adaptation will be
   required to ensure that conservation efforts fully consider the value of
   geodiversity for supporting biodiversity in the face of a changing
   climate.
   Incorporacion de la Geodiversidad en las Decisiones de Conservacion En
   un clima que cambia rapidamente, quienes practican la conservacion
   podrian usar la geodiversidad de mejor manera en una gama amplia de
   deciones de conservacion. Exploramos vias selectas por medio de las
   cuales esta integracion puede mejorar la toma de decisiones y las
   organizamos dentro del ciclo de manejo adaptativo de evaluacion,
   planeacion, implementacion y monitoreo. En pocas ocasiones se menciona a
   la geodiversidad en las leyes y la politica ambiental predominantes.
   Como la mayoria de las agencias de recursos naturales bajo mandato de
   conservar ciertas categorias de especies, el personal de las agencias se
   ve enfrentado a encontrar formas de implementar de manera practica
   nuevas directivas con miras a salir adelante frente al cambio climatico
   mientras se retienen los mandatos centrados en especies. Las ecoregiones
   y las clasificaciones ecologicas proporcionan mecanismos claros para
   considerar a la geodiversidad en los planes o decisiones. Esta inclusion
   ayudara a fomentar la resiliencia de la conservacion ante el cambio
   climatico. Los metodos para la evaluacion de la biodiversidad, como el
   analisis de intervalo, el analisis de vulnerabilidad ante el cambio
   climatico, y el modelado de procesos ecologicos, pueden adaptarse pronto
   a la inclusion del componente geofisico. Adaptamos las estrategias de
   otros para caracterizar paisajes de resistente, a resiliente, a
   susceptible, y hasta sensible, a lo largo de un continuo de
   vulnerabilidad ante el cambio climatico de la biota que presentan y
   despues resumimos las opciones para integrar a la geodiversidad en la
   planeacion en cada tipo de paisaje. En los paisajes que son
   relativamente resistentes al cambio climatico, existen opciones para
   representar completamente a la geodiversidad mientras se asegura que los
   procesos ecologicos dinamicos pueden cambiar a lo largo del tiempo. En
   los paisajes mas susceptibles, las estrategias que buscan mantener o
   restaurar la resiliencia ambiental y la conectividad son primordiales.
   Implementar acciones sobre el suelo requiere del entendimiento de las
   restricciones geofisicas sobre las especies y un enfoque cada vez mas
   agil para establecer objetivos de manejo y restauracion. Ya que las
   decisiones que se implementan hoy en dia seran reconsideradas y
   modificadas hacia el futuro, se requeriran de formas de monitoreo y
   adaptacion cada vez mas sofisticadas para asegurar que los esfuerzos de
   conservacion consideren de lleno el valor de la geodiversidad para
   apoyar a la biodiversidad de frente al clima cambiante.

Abstract = {{Floodplain vegetation states (communities) exhibit spatiotemporal
   dynamics in vegetation structure and composition, which reflect unique
   hydrological and connectivity patterns. Shifts in inundation regimes can
   drive succession and establish new stable states, determined by the
   magnitude and duration of the hydrological perturbation. We aimed to
   develop a modelling approach that is able to capture ecosystem dynamics,
   identify and quantify the main drivers of change, and provide a tool for
   conservation decision-making. We developed state and transition models
   for floodplain vegetation states based on surveys in 1991 and 2008 in
   the Macquarie Marshes (Australia), a Ramsar wetland of international
   importance. We used a Bayesian logistic regression approach to model
   state and transitions between vegetation states and investigated how
   flood frequency, distance to stream and fire frequency were associated
   with vegetation dynamics during this period. During 1991-2008,
   significant transitions have occurred towards drier states.
   Semi-permanent wetland vegetation had the lowest persistence probability
   (p(psis)=0456) and a significant threshold response of transitioning to
   terrestrial vegetation (p(tran)=0505). Transition to drier states was
   driven by lower inundation probabilities followed by increased fire
   probability, and distance to nearest stream. Using developed models, we
   predicted persistence probabilities of vegetation states under an
   unregulated (i.e. no dams or diversions) and regulated water
   availability system. Under a regulated system, semi-permanent wetland
   vegetation had an average persistence of p(psis)=0. 67 and 008 in the
   northern and southern sections of the nature reserve, respectively.
   Under an unregulated system, the predicted persistence of semi-permanent
   wetland vegetation was considerably higher: p(psis)=087 and 038,
   respectively.Synthesis and applications. Developing quantitative models
   of state transitions significantly improved our understanding of
   ecosystem dynamics, identifying sensitive indicators for monitoring and
   thus supporting conservation decision-making. This helps managers
   understand potential trajectories of change in ecosystems in response to
   management options. For example, increasing environmental flows in the
   Macquarie Marshes is predicted to shift the community towards more of a
   wetland than the terrestrial state, resulting from river regulation.
   State and transition models identified how key ecological assets respond
   to drivers of change, particularly where these can be managed. This is
   critical for ensuring that all ecosystem components are managed and that
   these do not shift into undesirable states.

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic environmental changes in climate, land use and disturbance
   regimes, as well as mass propagule transport are having dramatic effects
   on many ecosystems. Both conservationists and ecologists need
   ecologically relevant metrics to quantify the condition of plant and
   animal communities. However, current metrics fail to address the
   invasion of species native to different community types in the same
   region, even though these native aliens' can serve as valuable
   indicators of recent changes in habitat condition. We propose a novel
   approach to reconceptualize community biodiversity based on the
   composition of historically developed habitat-specific species pools.
   Total observed community diversity can be divided to characteristic
   diversity, consisting of species belonging to habitat-specific species
   pool, and derived diversity, consisting of either native or non-native
   species not typical to a given community and whose presence is driven by
   adverse human impact. Characteristic and derived diversity in
   communities have different historical backgrounds; thus, the ecological
   patterns of these components, effects on ecosystem functioning as well
   as actions necessary for their conservation are likewise different. We
   propose the Index of Favourable Conservation Status - the log ratio of
   characteristic to derived diversity - as an easily quantified,
   ecologically relevant and universal indicator of biodiversity integrity
   and community condition. The Index of Favourable Conservation Status
   provides valuable information on habitat conservation needs and recent
   adverse human impact in relative terms and can be compared between
   regions and across a wide range of ecosystems. It can also be used to
   monitor restoration success or characterize biodiversity degradation. We
   present standardized procedure of determining habitat-specific species
   pools and bring several examples of how the concept of characteristic
   and derived diversity can be applied in conservation and research and
   how expert knowledge on habitat-specific species pool composition can
   expand our understanding of community biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{European frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae L.) is an invasive floating
   plant that negatively affects native plants in freshwater ecosystems. We
   conducted a field mesocosm experiment in Oneida Lake, New York (USA), to
   study the effect of frogbit cover on macroinvertebrates and to test the
   effects of 2 physical control methods, hand pulling and shading, on
   macroinvertebrate assemblages. We used Hester-Dendy samplers and Ekman
   grabs to collect surface/phytophilous and benthic macroinvertebrates.
   Metrics including density of different types of organisms, total
   abundance, taxon richness, and Simpson's diversity index were compared
   between control methods. Frogbit cover had significant positive effects
   on mollusk density, amphipod density, taxon richness, and Simpson's
   diversity in the Hester-Dendy surface samples. Sites with frogbit had
   significantly fewer benthic worms and more chironomids (Hester-Dendy
   bottom samples) and possibly higher diversity of benthic
   macroinvertebrates (Ekman samples). These data suggested that frogbit
   had positive effects on surface and phytophilous macroinvertebrates and
   may change population density and increase diversity of benthic
   macroinvertebrates. Hand pulling and shading did not affect
   macroinvertebrates except that amphipod density in surface water was

Abstract = {{Ecologists increasingly use threshold elemental ratios (TERs) to explain
   and predict organism responses to altered resource C:P or C:N. TER
   calculations are grounded in diet-dependent growth, but growth data are
   limited for most taxa. Thus, TERs are derived instead from bioenergetics
   models that rely on simplifying assumptions, such as fixed organism C:P
   and no P excretion at peak growth. We examined stoichiometric regulation
   of the stream insect detritivore Pycnopsyche lepida to assess
   bioenergetics model assumptions and compared bioenergetics TERC:P
   estimates to those based on growth. We fed P. lepida maple and oak leaf
   diets along a dietary C:P gradient (molar C:P range = 950-4180) and
   measured consumption, growth, stoichiometric homeostasis (H), and
   elemental assimilation and growth efficiencies over a 5-wk period in the
   laboratory. Pycnopsyche lepida responses to varying resource C:P
   depended on litter identity and were strongest among oak diets, on which
   growth peaked at diet C:P = 1620. Pycnopsyche lepida fed oak litter
   exhibited flexible body C:P during growth and in response to altered
   diet C:P (non-strict homeostasis; H = 4.74), low P use efficiencies, and
   P excretion at peak growth. These trends violated common bioenergetics
   model assumptions and caused deviation of estimated TERC:P from C:P =
   1620. Bioenergetics TERC:P further varied among P. lepida of differing
   growth status on varying diet C:P (overall TERC:P range = 1030-9540).
   Our study identifies novel effects of nutrient enrichment and litter
   identity on detritivore stoichiometric regulation and supports

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2155-2168}},

Abstract = {{There is good evidence that species' distributions are shifting poleward
   in response to climate change and wide interest in the magnitude of such
   responses for scientific and conservation purposes. It has been
   suggested from the directions of climatic changes that species'
   distribution shifts may not be simply poleward, but this has been rarely
   tested with observed data. Here, we apply a novel approach to measuring
   range shifts on axes ranging through 360 degrees, to recent data on the
   distributions of 122 species of British breeding birds during 1988-1991
   and 2008-2011. Although previously documented poleward range shifts have
   continued, with an average 13.5km shift northward, our analysis
   indicates this is an underestimate because it ignores common and larger
   shifts that occurred along axes oriented to the north-west and
   north-east. Trailing edges contracted from a broad range of southerly
   directions. Importantly, these results are derived from systematically
   collected data so confounding observer-effort biases can be
   discounted.Analyses of climate for the same period show that whilst
   temperature trends should drive species along a north-north-westerly
   trajectory, directional responses to precipitation will depend on both
   the time of year that is important for determining a species'
   distribution, and the location of the range margin. Directions of
   species' range centroid shift were not correlated with spatial trends in
   any single climate variable. We conclude that range shifts of British
   birds are multidirectional, individualistic and probably determined by
   species-specific interactions of multiple climate factors. Climate
   change is predicted to lead to changes in community composition through
   variation in the rates that species' ranges shift; our results suggest
   communities could change further owing to constituent species shifting
   along different trajectories. We recommend more studies consider
   directionality in climate and range dynamics to produce more appropriate
   measures of observed and expected responses to climate change.}},

   in Colorado. We then combined these new records with previously
   published data on MPB outbreaks to examine the historical synchrony of
   outbreaks across western North America.
   ResultsThe tree-ring record indicated that multiple cross-site MPB
   outbreaks occurred in Colorado lodgepole pine forests, initiating c.
   1760s, 1780s, 1820s-1830s, 1860s, 1910s, 1960s and 1980s. Comparative
   analysis indicated that these outbreak dates coincide with documented
   and reconstructed MPB outbreaks in British Columbia, Colorado, Idaho,
   Montana, Wyoming and Utah.
   Main conclusionsSeveral subcontinental-scale MPB outbreaks have occurred
   in lodgepole pine forests over the past three centuries. Although the
   current study does not address the intensity of past outbreaks, it does
   indicate that previous outbreaks appear to have been highly synchronous
   across western North America. The subcontinental, rather than purely
   local, nature of these outbreaks is important for putting recent and
   future outbreaks of MPB into a broader ecological context. This study
   presents the longest tree-ring reconstruction of MPB outbreaks in the
   southern Rocky Mountains available to date, as well as the first
   subcontinental long-term comparative analysis of MPB outbreaks in
   western North America.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous coastal and estuarine management programs around the world are
   developing strategies for climate change and priorities for climate
   change adaptation. A multi-state work group collaborated with
   scientists, researchers, resource managers and non-governmental
   organizations to develop a monitoring program that would provide warning
   of climate change impacts to the Long Island Sound estuarine and coastal
   ecosystems. The goal of this program was to facilitate timely management
   decisions and adaptation responses to climate change impacts. A novel
   approach is described for strategic planning that combines available
   regional-scale predictions and climate drivers (top down) with local
   monitoring information (bottom up) to identify candidate sentinels of
   climate change. Using this approach, 37 candidate sentinels of climate
   change were identified as well as a suite of core abiotic parameters
   that are drivers of environmental change. A process for prioritizing
   sentinels was developed and identified six of high priority for
   inclusion in pilot-scale monitoring programs. A monitoring strategy and
   an online sentinel data clearinghouse were developed. The work and
   processes presented here are meant to serve as a guide to other coastal
   and estuarine management programs seeking to establish a targeted
   monitoring program for climate change and to provide a set of ``lessons

Abstract = {{In response to growing demand for ecosystem-level risk assessment in

   protocols, the IUCN recently endorsed new Red List criteria as a global
   standard for ecosystem risk assessment. Four qualities were sought in
   the design of the IUCN criteria: generality; precision; realism; and
   simplicity. Drawing from extensive global consultation, we explore
   trade-offs among these qualities when dealing with key challenges,
   including ecosystem classification, measuring ecosystem dynamics,
   degradation and collapse, and setting decision thresholds to delimit
   ordinal categories of threat. Experience from countries with national
   lists of threatened ecosystems demonstrates well-balanced trade-offs in
   current and potential applications of Red Lists of Ecosystems in
   legislation, policy, environmental management and education. The IUCN
   Red List of Ecosystems should be judged by whether it achieves
   conservation ends and improves natural resource management, whether its
   limitations are outweighed by its benefits, and whether it performs
   better than alternative methods. Future development of the Red List of
   Ecosystems will benefit from the history of the Red List of Threatened
   Species which was trialed and adjusted iteratively over 50 years from
   rudimentary beginnings. We anticipate the Red List of Ecosystems will
   promote policy focus on conservation outcomes in situ across whole

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{268-276}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Native re-forestation is a widely used restoration tool, typically
   undertaken with the expectation that planting native trees will initiate
   succession processes (including the re-establishment of native fauna)
   that will eventually return the ecosystem to a native-dominated state.
   Invertebrate groups can be used to assess restoration progress, as their
   life history traits enable them to respond more rapidly to environmental
   change than many other organisms. In this study, we assessed beetle
   responses to re-forestation. Using two trapping methods (flight
   intercept traps and pitfall traps), we compared beetle assemblages in
   exotic pasture (pre-restoration state), <10-year-old planted native
   forest (restoration intervention) and approximately 40-year-old
   unmanaged regenerating native forest (reference state). Analysis of the
   flight intercept-trapped beetles suggests that re-forestation has
   initiated a transition from an exotic-dominated pasture fauna toward a
   native-dominated fauna: in planted forests, 75\% of all
   flight-intercept-trapped beetles were native (compared with 22\% in
   pasture and 87\% in unmanaged forest). Flight intercept-trapped beetles
   also had higher native diversity and abundance in both forest types than
   in pasture. Pitfall-trapped beetle species were predominantly native in
   both forest types, but there were few statistically significant
   differences between the forests and pasture in the pit-fall trap data
   set. Both trapping methods detected significant compositional
   differences between the beetle assemblages in planted forest and
   unmanaged forest. Replanting native forest has increased native beetle
   diversity, abundance, and dominance (compared with the pre-restoration
   state), but convergence with the unmanaged reference forest has not yet
   been achieved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important constituents in soil is the microflora, mainly
   containing bacteria and fungi with high metabolic versatility and very
   complex intra- and interspecific interactions. Co-occurrence of several
   micro-organism species in soil regulates growth or suppression of single
   species, either by mutual tolerance or by induction of defence
   mechanisms, which may result in the release of secondary metabolites for
   growth suppression of coexisting species. Accumulations of heavy metals
   in soils can further affect the growth of soil microbial communities;
   this however is strongly dependent on the capability of micro-organisms
   to tolerate heavy metals. Until now, there is no fast and reliable
   method available to study the growth of microbial communities in highly
   resolved concentration spaces with environmentally relevant toxic
   substances such as heavy metals and to identify the tolerance thresholds
   of micro-organism communities of selected soils. Here, we present a new
   methodological approach for the assessment of the growth-response
   behaviour of soil microbial communities in response to increasing heavy
   metal concentration (copper) using the droplet-based micro-segmented
   flow technique. Therefore, micro-organism-containing soil slurries from
   contact with metal artefacts from archaeological excavations and from
   the surface of early copper-mining areas were studied by separate
   cultivation in segments in the sub-L range and growth, and fluorescence
   was characterized after cultivation by combined micro-flow-through
   photometry and fluorimetry. Highly resolved dose-response data provided
   copper tolerance thresholds of the soil communities of the different
   soils. Concentration-dependent growth patterns of the micro-organisms in
   the segments could be observed and allowed to distinguish response
   groups with characteristic distribution of photometric and fluorimetric
   measurement values. It is assumed that these response groups are caused
   by a sample characteristic growth of metal-tolerant microbial
   communities with characteristic critical metal concentrations for growth
   inhibition. The clear transitions between the groups in small
   concentration intervals are probably due to sharp transitions between
   growth and no growth of dominant micro-organism species at the critical
   metal concentration. The investigations demonstrate the potential of
   droplet-based microfluidic techniques for ultra-miniaturized ecological
   studies and its suitability for the assessment of tolerance thresholds
   of soil microbial communities from heavy metal-contaminated areas.}},

Abstract = {{Fungal invasions are increasingly recognized as a significant component
   of global changes, threatening ecosystem health and damaging food
   production. Invasive fungi also provide excellent models to evaluate the
   generality of results based on other eukaryotes. We first consider here
   the reasons why fungal invasions have long been overlooked: they tend to
   be inconspicuous, and inappropriate methods have been used for species
   recognition. We then review the information available on the patterns
   and mechanisms of fungal invasions. We examine the biological features
   underlying invasion success of certain fungal species. We review
   population structure analyses, revealing native source populations and
   strengths of bottlenecks. We highlight the documented ecological and
   evolutionary changes in invaded regions, including adaptation to
   temperature, increased virulence, hybridization, shifts to clonality and
   association with novel hosts. We discuss how the huge census size of
   most fungi allows adaptation even in bottlenecked, clonal invaders. We
   also present new analyses of the invasion of the anther-smut pathogen on
   white campion in North America, as a case study illustrating how an
   accurate knowledge of species limits and phylogeography of fungal
   populations can be used to decipher the origin of invasions. This case
   study shows that successful invasions can occur even when life history
   traits are particularly unfavourable to long-distance dispersal and even
   with a strong bottleneck. We conclude that fungal invasions are valuable
   models to contribute to our view of biological invasions, in particular
   by providing insights into the traits as well as ecological and

   study the RH2 and RH1 visual pigments (opsins) across 22 bird species
   belonging to two ecologically convergent clades, the New World warblers
   (Parulidae) and Old World warblers (Phylloscopidae) and evaluate rates
   of evolution in these clades along with data from 21 additional species.
   We demonstrate generally slow evolution of these opsins: both Rh1 and
   Rh2 are highly conserved across Old World and New World warblers.
   However, Rh2 underwent a burst of evolution within the New World genus
   Setophaga, where it accumulated substitutions at 6 amino acid sites
   across the species we studied. Evolutionary analyses revealed a
   significant increase in d(N)/d(S) in Setophaga, implying relatively
   strong selective pressures to overcome long-standing purifying
   selection. We studied the effects of each substitution on spectral
   tuning and found they do not cause large spectral shifts. Thus,
   substitutions may reflect other aspects of opsin function, such as those
   affecting photosensitivity and/or dark-light adaptation. Although it is
   unclear what these alterations mean for colour perception, we suggest
   that rapid evolution is linked to sexual selection, given the

Abstract = {{Low-input agricultural systems aim at reducing the use of synthetic
   fertilizers and pesticides in order to improve sustainable production
   and ecosystem health. Despite the integral role of the soil microbiome
   in agricultural production, we still have a limited understanding of the

   microbiome to more than two decades of different agricultural management
   in a long-term field experiment using a high-throughput pyrosequencing
   approach of bacterial and fungal ribosomal markers. Organic farming
   increased richness, decreased evenness, reduced dispersion and shifted
   the structure of the soil microbiota when compared with conventionally
   managed soils under exclusively mineral fertilization. This effect was
   largely attributed to the use and quality of organic fertilizers, as
   differences became smaller when conventionally managed soils under an
   integrated fertilization scheme were examined. The impact of the plant
   protection regime, characterized by moderate and targeted application of
   pesticides, was of subordinate importance. Systems not receiving manure
   harboured a dispersed and functionally versatile community characterized
   by presumably oligotrophic organisms adapted to nutrient-limited
   environments. Systems receiving organic fertilizer were characterized by
   specific microbial guilds known to be involved in degradation of complex
   organic compounds such as manure and compost. The throughput and

Abstract = {{Density estimates accounting for differential animal detectability are
   difficult to acquire for wide-ranging and elusive species such as
   mammalian carnivores. Pairing distance sampling with call-response
   surveys may provide an efficient means of tracking changes in
   populations of coyotes (Canis latrans), a species of particular interest
   in the eastern United States. Blind field trials in rural New York State
   indicated 119-m linear error for triangulated coyote calls, and a 1.8-km
   distance threshold for call detectability, which was sufficient to
   estimate a detection function with precision using distance sampling. We
   conducted statewide road-based surveys with sampling locations spaced
   6km apart from June to August 2010. Each detected call (be it a single
   or group) counted as a single object, representing 1 territorial pair,
   because of uncertainty in the number of vocalizing animals. From 524
   survey points and 75 detections, we estimated the probability of
   detecting a calling coyote to be 0.17 +/- 0.02 SE, yielding a
   detection-corrected index of 0.75 pairs/10 km(2) (95\% CI: 0.52-1.1,
   18.5\% CV) for a minimum of 8,133 pairs across rural New York State.
   Importantly, we consider this an index rather than true estimate of
   abundance given the unknown probability of coyote availability for
   detection during our surveys. Even so, pairing distance sampling with
   call-response surveys provided a novel, efficient, and noninvasive means
   of monitoring populations of wide-ranging and elusive, albeit reliably
   vocal, mammalian carnivores. Our approach offers an effective new means
   of tracking species like coyotes, one that is readily extendable to
   other species and geographic extents, provided key assumptions of

Abstract = {{Forest pathology, the science of forest health and tree diseases, is
   operating in a rapidly developing environment. Most importantly, global
   trade and climate change are increasing the threat to forest ecosystems
   posed by new diseases. Various studies relevant to forest pathology in a

   update of recent literature. In this contribution, we summarize research
   at the interface between forest pathology and landscape ecology,
   biogeography, global change science and research on tree endophytes.
   Regional outbreaks of tree diseases are requiring interdisciplinary
   collaboration, e.g. between forest pathologists and landscape
   ecologists. When tree pathogens are widely distributed, the factors
   determining their broad-scale distribution can be studied using a
   biogeographic approach. Global change, the combination of climate and
   land use change, increased pollution, trade and urbanization, as well as
   invasive species, will influence the effects of forest disturbances such
   as wildfires, droughts, storms, diseases and insect outbreaks, thus
   affecting the health and resilience of forest ecosystems worldwide. Tree
   endophytes can contribute to biological control of infectious diseases,
   enhance tolerance to environmental stress or behave as opportunistic
   weak pathogens potentially competing with more harmful ones. New
   molecular techniques are available for studying the complete tree
   endobiome under the influence of global change stressors from the

Abstract = {{AimPresence-only datasets represent an important source of information
   on species' distributions. Collections of presence-only data, however,
   are often spatially biased, particularly along roads and near urban
   populations. These biases can lead to inaccurate inferences and
   predicted distributions. We demonstrate a new approach of accounting for
   effort bias in presence-only data by explicitly incorporating sample
   biases in species distribution modelling.
   LocationAlberta, Canada.
   MethodsFirst, we used logistic regression to model sampling effort of
   recorded rare vascular plants, bryophytes and butterflies in Alberta.
   Second, we simulated presence/absence data for nine virtual' species
   based on three relative occurrence thresholds - common, rare and very
   rare - for each taxonomic group. We sampled these virtual species using
   our bias model to represent typical sampling effort characteristic of
   presence-only datasets. We then modelled the distributions of these
   virtual species using logistic regression and attempted to recover their
   original simulated distributions using a sample weighting term (prior
   weight) estimated as the inverse of probability of sampling.
   Bias-adjusted model estimates were compared to those obtained from
   random samples and biased samples without adjustment. We also compared
   prior-weight adjustment to bias-file and target-group background
   approaches in Maxent.
   ResultsSample weighting recovered regression coefficients and mapped
   predictions estimated from unbiased presence-only data and improved
   model predictive accuracy as evaluated by regression and correlation
   coefficients, sensitivity and specificity. Similar model improvements
   were achieved using the Maxent bias-file method, but results were
   inconsistent for the target-group background approach.
   Main conclusionsThese results suggest that sample weighting can be used
   to account for spatially biased presence-only datasets in species
   distribution modelling. The framework presented is potentially widely
   applicable due to availability of online biodiversity databases and the
   flexibility of the approach.}},

   similar to 100 mg l(-1), peaks at 250 mg l(-1)). Corals (Merulina

   months of recovery (constant regime) or pulsed turbidity events every
   other week followed by one month of recovery (periodic regime). Coral
   thresholds were greater than commonly used estimates with little to no
   effect on corals at moderate sediment levels. At extreme sediment
   levels, species morphological differences were potentially key
   determinants of coral survival. The periodic exposure regime was less
   detrimental to all coral species than the constant exposure regime as
   demonstrated by elevated yields and lower tissue morality rates. To
   improve knowledge on coral-sediment threshold values, research needs to
   expand to incorporate a broader range of species and exposure regimes.
   Realistic threshold values combined with modelling efforts would improve
   prediction of reef health and enable managers to react to declines in
   health before coral mortality occurs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Detecting the 20 year city-size dynamics in China with a rank clock

Abstract = {{Studies have shown that, city size and rank follow a Pareto distribution
   across countries and over time. However, inconsistent definitions and
   measurements of city size (e.g., urban population and urban area) in
   census data in China have hindered the retrieval of comparable Pareto
   coefficients over time. Additionally, abrupt changes in size and rank at
   the city level are neglected in many studies. In this study, we
   extracted an alternative and consistently comparable measurement of city
   size from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Line-scan
   System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light images. Besides the traditional
   regression analysis at the national level, we also adopted the rank
   clock method to analyze city-size evolution at the city level. We found
   that: (1) the distribution of urban areas became more even in China,
   with an increase of the Pareto's coefficient from 0.79 in 1992 to 0.90
   in 2008; (2) the most obvious change in urban-area distribution at the
   national level occurred during the period from 2000 to 2003, which is
   consistent with turbulent rank changes at the city level; and (3) our
   combined method revealed another period from 1992 to 1995 with large
   rank fluctuations, which was masked by the relatively stable Pareto's
   coefficients extracted at the national level. The results demonstrate
   the new DMSP/OLS nighttime light images and the combined method are
   useful for revealing city-size dynamics in a more consistent way from
   both national and city perspectives. The results enrich our
   understanding of city-size evolution and have valuable implications for
   relevant decision makers and stakeholders. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The recovery of historic community assemblages on reefs is a primary
   objective for the management of marine ecosystems. Working under the
   overall hypothesis that, as fishing pressure increases, the abundance in
   upper trophic levels decreases followed by intermediate levels, we
   develop an index that characterizes the comparative health of rocky
   reefs. Using underwater visual transects to sample rocky reefs in the
   Gulf of California, Mexico, we sampled 147 reefs across 1200 km to test
   this reef health index (IRH). Five-indicators described 88\% of the
   variation among the reefs along this fishing-intensity gradient: the
   biomass of piscivores and carnivores were positively associated with
   reef health; while the relative abundances of zooplanktivores, sea
   stars, and sea urchins, were negatively correlated with degraded reefs
   health. The average size of commercial macro-invertebrates and the
   absolute fish biomass increased significantly with increasing values of
   the IRE. Higher total fish biomass was found on reefs with complex
   geomorphology compared to reefs with simple geomorphology (r(2) = 0.14,
   F = 44.05, P<0.0001) and the trophic biomass pyramid also changed, which
   supports the evidence of the inversion of biomass pyramids along the
   gradient of reefs' health. Our findings introduce a novel approach to
   classify the health of rocky reefs under different fishing regimes and
   therefore resultant community structures. Additionally, our IRH provides
   insight regarding the potential gains in total fish biomass that may
   result from the conservation and protection of reefs with more complex
   geomorphology. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{347-354}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Almost all organisms on Earth exhibit ontogenetic niche shifts, which
   causes great phenotypic variation among individuals and is thus
   considered to critically mediate community structure and dynamics. In
   contrast, community ecology has traditionally assumed that species are
   composed of identical individuals with invariant traits and ignored the
   potentially important ecological roles of ontogenetic niche shifts. To
   bridge the gap, here I briefly review ecologically relevant examples
   which show that basic insights of species-based community theories can
   be revised by including the ontogenetic perspective. Specifically, I
   focus on the most representative animals in the study of ontogenetic
   niche shifts, i.e., fish, insects, and amphibians. Notably, their
   ontogenetic niche shifts create novel views of community structure: (1)
   ontogenetic diet shifts of predatory fish couple pelagic and benthic
   food webs in aquatic systems, (2) ontogenetic shifts in interaction
   types of pollinating insects couple herbivory and pollination networks
   in terrestrial systems, and (3) ontogenetic habitat shifts of amphibians
   and aquatic insects couple aquatic and terrestrial metacommunities at
   interface areas. Dynamic models of such stage-structured communities
   suggest that their ontogenetic niche shifts may affect the community
   resilience and disturbance responses. Exploring more complex systems
   (e.g., where many species undergo ontogenetic niche shifts several times
   or continuously) is a future direction, for which describing body size
   relationships between interacting organisms would be a promising
   approach. I conclude that both theoretical and empirical advances are
   needed to facilitate the ontogenetic perspective for better
   understanding mechanisms underlying biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning which are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic
   disturbance.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is raising challenging concerns for systematic
   conservation planning. Are methods based on the current spatial patterns
   of biodiversity effective given long-term climate change? Some
   conservation scientists argue that planning should focus on protecting
   the abiotic diversity in the landscape, which drives patterns of
   biological diversity, rather than focusing on the distribution of focal
   species, which shift in response to climate change. Climate is one
   important abiotic driver of biodiversity patterns, as different climates
   host different biological communities and genetic pools. We propose
   conservation networks that capture the full range of climatic diversity
   in a region will improve the resilience of biotic communities to climate
   change compared to networks that do not. In this study we used
   historical and future hydro-climate projections from the high resolution
   Basin Characterization Model to explore the utility of directly
   targeting climatic diversity in planning. Using the spatial planning
   tool, Marxan, we designed conservation networks to capture the diversity
   of climate types, at the regional and sub-regional scale, and compared
   them to networks we designed to capture the diversity of vegetation
   types. By focusing on the Conservation Lands Network (CLN) of the San
   Francisco Bay Area as a real-world case study, we compared the potential
   resilience of networks by examining two factors: the range of climate
   space captured, and climatic stability to 18 future climates, reflecting
   different emission scenarios and global climate models. We found that
   the climate-based network planned at the sub-regional scale captured a
   greater range of climate space and showed higher climatic stability than
   the vegetation and regional based-networks. At the same time,
   differences among network scenarios are small relative to the variance
   in climate stability across global climate models. Across different
   projected futures, topographically heterogeneous areas consistently show
   greater climate stability than homogenous areas. The analysis suggests
   that utilizing high-resolution climate and hydrological data in
   conservation planning improves the likely resilience of biodiversity to
   climate change. We used these analyses to suggest new conservation
   priorities for the San Francisco Bay Area.}},

   in forest cover?}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Logging roads in the Congo Basin are often associated with forest
   degradation through fragmentation and access for other land uses.
   However, in concessions managed for timber production, secondary roads
   are usually closed after exploitation and are expected to disappear
   subsequently. Little is known about the effectiveness of this
   prescription and the factors affecting vegetation recovery rate on
   abandoned logging roads. In a novel approach we assessed logging roads
   as temporary elements in the forest landscape that vary in persistence
   depending on environmental conditions. We analyzed road persistence
   during the period 1986-2013 in adjacent parts of Cameroon, Central
   African Republic and Republic of Congo. Three successive phases of road
   recovery were identified on LANDSAT images: open roads with bare soil,
   roads in the process of revegetation after abandonment and disappeared
   roads no longer distinguishable from the surrounding forest. Field based
   inventories confirmed significant differences between all three
   categories in density and richness of woody species and cover of
   dominant herbs. We used dead-end road segments, built for timber
   exploitation, as sampling units. Only 6\% of them were identified as
   being re-opened. Survival analyses showed median persistence of four
   years for open roads before changing to the revegetating state and 20
   years for revegetating roads before disappearance. Persistence of
   revegetating roads was 25\% longer on geologically poor substrates which
   might result from slower forest recovery in areas with lower levels of
   soil nutrient content. We highlight the contrast amongst forests growing
   on different types of substrate in their potential for ecosystem
   recovery over time after roads have been abandoned. Forest management
   plans need to take these constraints into account. Logging activities
   should be concentrated on the existing road network and sites of low
   soil resource levels should be spared from business-as-usual
   exploitation.}},

Abstract = {{The precautionary principle is an essential guideline in decision
   making, particularly for regulating novel developments with unknown or
   insufficiently proven environmental impact. However, due to the inherent
   component of uncertainty it has been widely criticized for being
   ``unscientific{''}, i.e. hindering progress without sufficient evidence.
   The consequential postulation, that precautionary measures are only
   justified if the addressed threats are plausible and the measures
   reasonable, calls for methods to guide action in the face of
   uncertainty. Using the example of species conservation versus wind-farm
   construction, an expanding development with hypothesized - but
   unexplored - effects on our model species the capercaillie (Tetrao
   urogallus), we present an approach that aims at compensating the lack of
   knowledge about the threat itself by making best use of the available
   knowledge about the object at risk. By systematically combining
   information drawn from population monitoring and spatial modelling with
   population ecological thresholds, we identified areas of different
   functionality and importance to metapopulation persistence and
   connectivity. We integrated this information into a spatial concept
   defining four area-categories with different implications for wind power
   development. Highest priority was assigned to areas covering the spatial
   and functional requirements of a minimum viable population, i.e. sites
   where the plausibility for threat is highest, the uncertainty as regards
   importance for the population is lowest, and thus the justification for
   precautionary measures is strongest. This gradated approach may also
   enhance public acceptance, as it attempts to avoid either
   error-minimization bias (i.e. being too restrictive or permissive) the
   precautionary principle is frequently criticized for. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Species Distribution Models (SDMs) could be an important tool to limit

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Spatial climate variables are routinely used in species distribution
   models (SDMs) without accounting for the fact that they have been
   predicted with uncertainty, which can lead to biased estimates,
   erroneous inference and poor performances when predicting to new
   settings - for example under climate change scenarios. We show how
   information on uncertainty associated with spatial climate variables can
   be obtained from climate data models. We then explain different types of
   uncertainty (i.e. classical and Berkson error) and use two statistical
   methods that incorporate uncertainty in climate variables into SDMs by
   means of (i) hierarchical modelling and (ii) simulation-extrapolation.
   We used simulation to study the consequences of failure to account for
   measurement error. When uncertainty in explanatory variables was not
   accounted for, we found that coefficient estimates were biased and the
   SDM had a loss of statistical power. Further, this bias led to biased
   predictions when projecting change in distribution under climate change
   scenarios. The proposed errors-in-variables methods were less sensitive
   to these issues. We also fit the proposed models to real data
   (presence/absence data on the Carolina wren, Thryothorus ludovicianus),
   as a function of temperature variables. The proposed framework allows
   for many possible extensions and improvements to SDMs. If information on
   the uncertainty of spatial climate variables is available to
   researchers, we recommend the following: (i) first identify the type of
   uncertainty; (ii) consider whether any spatial autocorrelation or
   independence assumptions are required; and (iii) attempt to incorporate
   the uncertainty into the SDM through established statistical methods and

Abstract = {{Aim: This paper demonstrates methods to extend standardized vegetation
   zone descriptions and snapped distributions across political boundaries.
   An extended climate niche for North America's Coastal Douglas-fir (CDF)
   forest zone is determined and projected to evaluate its potential
   distribution under a changing climate and to identify climate refugia
   for conservation planning.
   Location: Pacific Northwest temperate rain forest in British Columbia
   (BC), CA, and nearby Washington (WA) and Oregon (OR), US.
   Methods: Using a combination of ecosystem polygon mapping and ecological
   plot data with climate interpolation tools, forests characterized as CDF
   under BC's biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification system were
   identified in the neighbouring US. Current (baseline) limits to CDF
   distribution were identified and used to map its potential distribution
   and climate refugia under future climate conditions using ensemble
   Global Climate Model projections.
   Results: The extended CDF climate niche covers 76 725 km(2) under
   baseline conditions, with the majority of the area in the Pacific
   Northwest US. The extended CDF forest zone includes a vegetation
   assemblage consistent with existing definitions of BC's CDF; moist
   maritime subzone, but also an additional vegetation assemblage
   representing a drier maritime subzone. Projections of future climate
   suggest a northerly shift (similar to 150 km) and a decrease (-91.5\%)
   in overall CDF area. Climate refugia are projected for discontinuous
   patches of CDF forest on Vancouver Island and adjacent mainland.
   Conclusions: This project combined georeferenced ecological plot data
   and digital maps, thereby facilitating the international mapping of
   ecosystem distributions in adjacent administrative areas that do not
   currently use the same ecosystem classification and snapping systems.
   This approach and the concept of climate niche definition, distribution
   and persistence are applicable to the management, restoration and
   conservation of plant communities, particularly in evaluating future
   ecosystem range shifts and disruptions associated with a changing
   climate. The potential for dramatic reductions in the range of the
   Coastal Douglas-fir zone, with persistence in <15\% of its current area,
   suggest that most of the extended CDF zone is marginally suitable for
   the characteristic CDF ecosystems and that slight shifts in climate or
   disturbance regime Essay greatly alter the character of the
   vegetation.The full climatic niche for British Columbia's Coastal
   Douglas-fir forest zone is determined from its mapped distribution and
   georeferenced plot data in the neighbouring USA. A new subzone is
   characterized, and the potential distribution of the extended zone is
   projected under a changing climate to identity climate refugia. For
   sensitive ecosystems with multi-jurisdictional distributions, this
   approach helps focus conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Surrogates are used widely in ecology to detect or monitor changes in
   the environment that are too difficult or costly to assess directly. Yet
   most work on surrogates to date has been correlative, with little work
   on their predictive capacity or the circumstances under which they work.
   Our suggestion is to revisit and learn from research in the clinical
   medical sciences, including the causal statistical frameworks available
   to validate relationships between treatments, surrogate variables, and
   the outcome of interest. We adapt this medical thinking to ecology by
   providing a new framework that involves specification of the surrogate
   model, statistical validation, and subsequent evaluation in a range of
   spatial and temporal contexts. An inter-disciplinary surrogate concept
   will allow for a more rigorous approach to validating and evaluating
   proxy variables, thus advancing the selection and application of
   surrogates in ecology.
   Synthesis We draw together ideas from the medical sciences to define an
   explicit surrogate concept that has not previously been used in ecology.
   We present a new framework for specifying surrogate models involving
   validation using a causal framework, and subsequent re-evaluation in
   different spatial and temporal contexts - an approach closely aligned
   with that used by researchers in the clinical medical sciences. This
   rigorous method can advance the science underpinning the application of
   surrogates in ecology by shifting the focus away from correlative
   understanding to one that focuses instead on causation and prediction.
   An improved use of surrogates is imperative if we are to meet the
   challenge of properly measuring and understanding the multifarious and
   complex problems in contemporary ecology.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{458-468}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Multiple aspects of the environment often change at the same time,
   influencing populations directly by modifying their physiology, but also
   indirectly by influencing other interacting species. The impacts of each
   environmental change upon population dynamics are usually assumed be
   independent of the state of other aspects of the environment, despite
   evidence at the individual level indicating that the combined impacts
   are often non-additive. The importance of indirect effects mediated
   through community interactions also has high uncertainty. We used
   experimental microcosms to determine whether environmental factors
   interact to affect species dynamics and the relative importance of
   direct and indirect effects on species dynamics. We factorially
   manipulated three aspects of the environment (temperature, food
   availability and salinity) and examined reciprocal invasions of
   competing protist species under each environment. Experimental
   observations were used to parameterize a dynamic model of the system.
   Using this model and a novel variance decomposition method, we examined
   the mechanisms by which environmental changes altered species invasion
   rates. The three environmental factors interacted when modifying species
   growth rates, intra- and interspecific competition, causing the impact
   of each environmental change on species dynamics to depend crucially on
   the state of other aspects of the environment. Indirect changes in the
   abundance of the resident competitor and its interspecific competitive
   ability were the main cause of environmental driven variation in
   invasion rates, whilst direct effects on species intrinsic growth rates

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) is the nutrient that most frequently limits the
   productivity of forest ecosystems. Understanding N cycling and forest
   response to altered N inputs and climate change is an ongoing research
   challenge. In several intensively studied forests in northeastern North
   America, well-characterized N inputs are not balanced by measured N
   losses, suggesting that an unmeasured N loss pathway such as
   denitrification may be important. We studied soil denitrification gas
   fluxes in northern hardwood forests at the Hubbard Brook long-term
   ecological research site in New Hampshire, USA, and found that
   denitrification in apparently oxic soils could account for N losses
   greater than half of annual atmospheric N inputs. Denitrification rates
   were strongly affected by elevation and season, with higher rates
   occurring at high elevation plots and during snowmelt. These results
   suggest that denitrification accounts for a major portion of the
   increasing amounts of ``missing N{''} reported for this site, and that a
   significant amount of the anthropogenic N that enters terrestrial
   ecosystems in northeastern North America is returned to the atmosphere
   as N-2. These dynamics are highly vulnerable to change, however, as soil
   moisture levels and conditions during snowmelt are changing rapidly
   along with climate.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{513-524}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Conservation outcomes are uncertain. Agencies making decisions about
   what threat mitigation actions to take to save which species frequently
   face the dilemma of whether to invest in actions with high probability
   of success and guaranteed benefits or to choose projects with a greater
   risk of failure that might provide higher benefits if they succeed. The
   answer to this dilemma lies in the decision maker's aversion to
   risktheir unwillingness to accept uncertain outcomes. Little guidance
   exists on how risk preferences affect conservation investment
   priorities. Using a prioritization approach based on cost effectiveness,
   we compared 2 approaches: a conservative probability threshold approach
   that excludes investment in projects with a risk of management failure
   greater than a fixed level, and a variance-discounting heuristic used in
   economics that explicitly accounts for risk tolerance and the
   probabilities of management success and failure. We applied both
   approaches to prioritizing projects for 700 of New Zealand's threatened
   species across 8303 management actions. Both decision makers' risk
   tolerance and our choice of approach to dealing with risk preferences
   drove the prioritization solution (i.e., the species selected for
   management). Use of a probability threshold minimized uncertainty, but
   more expensive projects were selected than with variance discounting,
   which maximized expected benefits by selecting the management of species
   with higher extinction risk and higher conservation value. Explicitly
   incorporating risk preferences within the decision making process
   reduced the number of species expected to be safe from extinction
   because lower risk tolerance resulted in more species being excluded
   from management, but the approach allowed decision makers to choose a
   level of acceptable risk that fit with their ability to accommodate
   failure. We argue for transparency in risk tolerance and recommend that
   decision makers accept risk in an adaptive management framework to
   maximize benefits and avoid potential extinctions due to inefficient
   allocation of limited resources.}},

Abstract = {{The palaeoecological assessment, and the use of stable isotopes of
   carbon in subfossils of herbivores and omnivores, represents a novel
   approach to understand transitions in past food-web structure and the
   dynamics of lake ecosystems in response to natural perturbations and
   human impacts. Combined with records of subfossil assemblages of
   cladocerans and chironomids, it may be possible to decipher whether
   changes are attributable to external forces or internally derived system
   shifts.
   A sediment record taken from the shallow (2.3m depth) Kings Billabong in
   the River Murray floodplain (Australia) was analysed to explore changes
   in trophic dynamics over the past century.
   The palaeoecological assessment revealed that littoral assemblages of
   cladocerans and benthic diatoms were gradually replaced by planktonic
   (planktonic and facultative planktonic) assemblages after river
   regulation in the 1920s.
   The stable isotopic composition of carbon (C-13), derived from
   chironomid head capsules, was relatively constant down-core, ranging
   between -26.1 and -24.0, and coincided largely with the C-13 of bulk
   sediment samples (-25.6 parts per thousand to -22.0 parts per thousand).
   The C-13 values of pelagic (Daphnia) and ubiquitous (Bosmina, Alona)
   cladocerans, however, varied markedly, with that for Daphnia between
   -29.8 parts per thousand (10-20cm) and -23.2 parts per thousand
   (60-70cm), and for ubiquitous cladocerans, between -29.4 parts per
   thousand (20-30cm) and -24.5 parts per thousand (80-70cm).
   The temporal changes in the C-13 values of cladocerans also suggest a
   gradual transition from a macrophyte-dominated state to a
   phytoplankton-dominated state after river regulation and further
   indicate changes in the horizontal migration behaviour of Daphnia
   depending on macrophyte abundance and predation risk.
   Our study demonstrates the potential of reconstructing, more precisely,
   the trophic dynamics of large river floodplain lakes and their
   ecological resilience by combining subfossil analyses with stable
   isotope analyses of selected subfossil groups.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme climatic events can trigger abrupt and often lasting change in
   ecosystems via the reduction or elimination of foundation (i.e.,
   habitat-forming) species. However, while the frequency/intensity of
   extreme events is predicted to increase under climate change, the impact
   of these events on many foundation species and the ecosystems they
   support remains poorly understood. Here, we use the iconic seagrass
   meadows of Shark Bay, Western Australia - a relatively pristine
   subtropical embayment whose dominant, canopy-forming seagrass,
   Amphibolis antarctica, is a temperate species growing near its
   low-latitude range limit - as a model system to investigate the impacts
   of extreme temperatures on ecosystems supported by thermally sensitive
   foundation species in a changing climate. Following an unprecedented
   marine heat wave in late summer 2010/11, A. antarctica experienced
   catastrophic (>90\%) dieback in several regions of Shark Bay.
   Animal-borne video footage taken from the perspective of resident,
   seagrass-associated megafauna (sea turtles) revealed severe habitat
   degradation after the event compared with a decade earlier. This
   reduction in habitat quality corresponded with a decline in the health
   status of largely herbivorous green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in the
   2years following the heat wave, providing evidence of long-term,
   community-level impacts of the event. Based on these findings, and
   similar examples from diverse ecosystems, we argue that a generalized
   framework for assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems to abrupt change
   associated with the loss of foundation species is needed to accurately
   predict ecosystem trajectories in a changing climate. This includes
   seagrass meadows, which have received relatively little attention in
   this context. Novel research and monitoring methods, such as the
   analysis of habitat and environmental data from animal-borne video and
   data-logging systems, can make an important contribution to this
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{Flooded rice is grown across wide geographic boundaries from as far
   north as Manchuria and as far south as Uruguay and New South Wales,
   primarily because of its adaptability across diverse agronomic and
   climatic conditions. Salt-stress damage, a common occurrence in delta
   and coastal rice production zones, could be heightened by the
   interactions between high temperature and relative humidity (vapor
   pressure deficit - VPD). Using temporal and spatial observations
   spanning 107 seasons and 19 rice-growing locations throughout India with
   varying electrical conductivity (EC), including coastal saline, inland
   saline, and alkaline soils, we quantified the proportion of VPD inducing
   salinity damage in rice. While controlling for time-invariant factors
   such as trial locations, rice cultivars, and soil types, our regression
   analysis indicates that EC has a nonlinear detrimental effect on paddy
   rice yield. Our estimates suggest these yield reductions become larger
   at higher VPD. A one standard deviation (SD) increase in EC from its
   mean value is associated with 1.68\% and 4.13\% yield reductions at
   median and maximum observed VPD levels, respectively. Yield reductions
   increase roughly sixfold when the one SD increase is taken from the 75th
   percentile of EC. In combination, high EC and VPD generate near
   catastrophic crop loss as predicted yield approaches zero. If higher VPD
   levels driven by global warming materialize in conjunction with rising
   sea levels or salinity incursion in groundwater, this interaction
   becomes an important and necessary predictor of expected yield losses
   and global food security.}},

Abstract = {{AimPredicting the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems or how
   fish and other species are adapting to rising sea temperatures is still
   subject to much uncertainty, despite considerable progress in recent
   years. In this study we assess whether our understanding of the impact
   of sea warming on marine fish can be enhanced with an interdisciplinary
   approach that collates data from fisheries, fishermen and scientific
   research. By doing this, we aim to shed light on the major changes in
   the abundance and diversity of warm and cold water fish in recent
   decades in relation to sea warming.
   LocationThis study was conducted in the north-western Mediterranean,
   where the impacts of global warming are particularly critical because
   range shifts are physically constrained.
   MethodsWe collected and combined statistical data from fisheries, the
   traditional ecological knowledge of fishermen (TEK), reproductive data
   (histological gonad analyses and ichthyoplankton surveys) and extensive
   research into the relevant literature (including systematic catalogues
   and museum collections and their databases).
   ResultsWe have found that changes in the abundance of fish have followed
   a particular spatio-temporal sequence, with three different phases of
   colonization in the case of warm-water species (occasional occurrence,
   common presence and establishment), and three phases of regression
   (abundance reduction, range contraction and disappearance from the
   catch) in the case of cold-water species.
   Main conclusionsOverall, the results show that this multidisciplinary
   approach, combining qualitative and quantitative information from
   different sources, provides new insight into the observed changes in
   fish diversity and abundance in relation to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel approach to the evaluation of anthropogenic
   impacts on flood risks in coastal mega-cities by incorporating three
   anthropogenic variables (land subsidence, urbanization and flood
   defence) within a scenario-based framework where numerical modelling was
   undertaken to quantify the risks. The evolving risks at four time points
   (1979, 1990, 2000 and 2009) were assessed for the Huangpu River
   floodplain where the city of Shanghai is located. A 2D hydrodynamic
   model (FloodMap-Inertial) was used to estimate the flood risks
   associated with each scenario. Flood events with various return periods
   (10-, 100- and 1000-year) were designed based on a one in 50 year flood
   event that occurred in Shanghai on August 1997.
   Results demonstrate the individual as well as the combined impacts of
   the three anthropogenic factors on the changing fluvial flood risks in
   the Huangpu River basin over the last three decades during the city's
   transitional economy (1979-2009). Land subsidence and urbanization were
   found to lead to proportionate but non-linear impact on flood risks due
   to their complex spatial and temporal interaction. The impacts and their
   sensitivity are the function of the rate and spatial distribution of
   each evolving factor. While the pattern of response to individual
   anthropogenic variables is largely expected, the combined impacts
   demonstrate greater spatial and temporal variation. Flood defences offer
   considerable benefits in reducing the total inundated areas in the
   Huangpu River basin over the periods considered, for all magnitude
   floods. This, to a large extent, alleviates the adverse impacts arising
   from land subsidence and urbanization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Population dynamics and in particular microbial population dynamics,
   though intrinsically discrete and random, are conventionally represented
   as deterministic differential equations systems. In these type of
   models, populations are represented by continuous population sizes or
   densities usually with deterministic dynamics.
   Over the last decades, alternate individual-based models have been
   proposed where population is explicitly represented as a set of
   individuals. These may include stochastic dynamics or stochastic rules.
   With reference to the last class of models we can also associate pure
   jump processes where the population is described as a discrete
   population size with stochastic discrete event evolutions.
   In the first class of models the population dynamics and its
   representation may be viewed respectively as deterministic and
   continuous, in the second class they may be viewed respectively as
   stochastic and discrete.
   In this present work, we present a modeling approach that bridges the
   two representations. This link can be mathematically described as a
   functional law of large numbers in high population size asymptotics.
   These results suggest new strategies of modeling and simulation. We
   illustrate this approach on the modeling of the chemostat. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Species importance is often defined by how central the role a species
   plays in a food web. Here we argue that species importance should also
   incorporate the concept of uniqueness of its network position. By
   developing a previous methodology, we propose a new approach for species
   uniqueness. Our methodology quantifies the interaction structure of
   species, separates strong and weak interactors in a threshold-dependent
   way and measures the similarity of strong interactors' identity for
   pairs of species. By exploring various threshold values systematically,
   the profile of a species' trophic overlap can be constructed. Summing up
   the extent of trophic overlap across the whole profile for a species, we
   then obtain a new measure for species uniqueness. A unique species
   should overlap less with other species and therefore has a low value for
   this new measure. We demonstrate our methodology by using the food web
   representation of Prince Williams Sound ecosystem. Drastic differences
   between our new result and that derived from the previous approach are
   found. We further compare the result with other network indices and
   found that the information generated from our new approach differs from
   the majority others. This in turn implies our approach offer an

Abstract = {{Sandy beaches, forming the most widespread coastal habitat in the world,
   are threatened by the effects of increasing anthropogenic pressure in
   the context of global change, including the increased occurrence of
   green tides composed of free-living Ulva spp. Sandy beaches are also
   highly dynamic ecosystems that support numerous essential ecological
   functions and contain a distinctive biodiversity, but their precise
   functioning and natural variability (i.e. the disentangling of
   biological and physical influences) remain under-studied. Our study
   aimed at determining the effects of space, time, and environmental
   variables on the natural variability of macrofaunal community structure
   and at specifically determining the effects of macroalgal accumulations
   on the observed variability. We followed a high-resolution field
   sampling design in space and time (261 samples) at non-vegetated and at
   partially and fully green-tide-impacted macrotidal sandy beaches. We
   used novel statistical approaches (distance-based Moran's eigenvector
   maps {[}dbMEMs] and variation partitioning) to analyse our results. The
   macrofaunal community structure of the non-vegetated sandy beach was
   variable in space and time at small scales, and physical environmental
   variables significantly explained these variations. Our study also
   highlighted a decrease in this variability along a gradient of
   increasing coverage of stranded Ulva spp. and the increasing importance
   of biological variables in explaining ecological variability. Compared
   to a state with no Ulva, a large and homogeneous coverage of Ulva along
   a sandy beach shore induced a significant decrease of overall
   beta-diversity. However, macrofaunal responses to macroalgal
   accumulation were less pronounced than what has been previously shown in
   micro-tidal and sheltered systems, likely due to the dynamic and
   unstable nature of high-energy macrotidal sandy shores.}},

Abstract = {{Seeds of major crop cultivars provide a vital genetic and cultural link
   from one human generation to the next Information embodied in seed is
   essential to continuity of food production, adaptation to changing
   climate, and evolution of human society. Introduction of transgenic
   (GMO) technologies simplifies management, appears profitable for seed
   companies and farmers, and promotes efficient industrialization of
   agriculture, although there is ongoing debate about potential of GMO
   varieties to increase genetic yield potential. Although short-term
   profits are one measure of success, there are other methods to evaluate
   long-term sustainability that are not accounted for in the market place.
   Emergy analysis accounts for biophysical, economic, environmental and
   information costs in seed production. It was used to calculate resource
   demand of GMO seed development and production for sale to farmers and to
   explore the direct and indirect environmental costs for storing new
   information. This includes initial transformation through testing to
   commercial seed production, and emphasizes environmental accounting.
   Maize (Zea mays L) and soybean (Glycine max L) seed production in
   Argentina are used to evaluate the GMO breeding strategy. We used our
   calculations for conventional hybrids and varieties as well as emergy
   evaluation of crop production from literature as references. Analysis of
   the GMO process was divided into a) identification and isolation of a
   desired gene and transfer into another genome; b) transfer of the chosen
   trait into a selected commercial line of maize or variety of soybean;
   and c) trials for adaptation and seed multiplication to obtain
   commercial products for sale to farmers. Comparable emergy used for
   conventional hybrids and varieties comes from steps b) and c). Results
   from step c) showed a low reliance of the GMO process on renewable
   resources (8\%-12\%); a lower or similar efficiency in converting input
   resources into the desired output compared to non-GMO crop production
   from other studies and our estimates from conventional seed production;
   and a high contribution from services (indirect labor, around 70\% of
   total emergy). The resource investments for using, extracting and
   transforming available information of present GMO strategies are not
   commensurate with achieved results, and may increase due to
   unanticipated ecosystem reactions over the long term due to a continuous
   rebound effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{New tools and approaches are becoming available for wildlife
   conservation managers to help support climate adaptation activities, but
   few studies have documented how practitioners have applied these tools
   and perceive their utility. We surveyed the literature and users of the
   NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI), a tool that is
   widely used in North America to assess species' vulnerability to climate
   change, to characterize 1) how the tool has been used; 2) the objectives
   addressed by projects using the tool; 3) novel approaches that might be
   useful to other users; 4) how the results contributed to climate change
   adaptation planning; and 5) needed improvements recognized by users of
   the tool. Responses from 25 CCVI users, representing state agencies and
   natural heritage programs, conservation organizations, and universities,
   combined with published reports from 20 CCVI assessments, indicated that
   the CCVI has been applied to large numbers of species from diverse
   taxonomic groups. Results from these assessments have been used to
   communicate about climate change vulnerability, select species to be
   prioritized for management, inform management decisions, identify
   monitoring needs, and inform land-acquisition decisions. Users of the
   CCVI have developed novel ways to address uncertainty in climate and
   species natural-history data, involve stakeholders, evaluate migratory
   species, address specific management questions, and combine outputs with
   the results of parallel spatial analyses. To address user needs, future
   iterations of the tool should address climate exposure in the full life
   cycle of migratory species; better examine species dependent on specific
   vegetation microhabitats; and improve treatment of the effects of
   climate on diseases, parasites, and natural enemies. (c) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Geospatial modeling is one of the most powerful tools available to
   conservation biologists for estimating current species ranges of Earth's
   biodiversity. Now, with the advantage of predictive climate models,
   these methods can be deployed for understanding future impacts on
   threatened biota. Here, we employ predictive modeling under a
   conservative estimate of future climate change to examine impacts on the
   future abundance and geographic distributions of Malagasy lemurs. Using
   distribution data from the primary literature, we employed ensemble
   species distribution models and geospatial analyses to predict future
   changes in species distributions. Current species distribution models
   (SDMs) were created within the BIOMOD2 framework that capitalizes on ten
   widely used modeling techniques. Future and current SDMs were then
   subtracted from each other, and areas of contraction, expansion, and
   stability were calculated. Model overprediction is a common issue
   associated Malagasy taxa. Accordingly, we introduce novel methods for
   incorporating biological data on dispersal potential to better inform
   the selection of pseudo-absence points. This study predicts that 60\% of
   the 57 species examined will experience a considerable range of
   reductions in the next seventy years entirely due to future climate
   change. Of these species, range sizes are predicted to decrease by an
   average of 59.6\%. Nine lemur species (16\%) are predicted to expand
   their ranges, and 13 species (22.8\%) distribution sizes were predicted
   to be stable through time. Species ranges will experience severe shifts,
   typically contractions, and for the majority of lemur species,
   geographic distributions will be considerably altered. We identify three
   areas in dire need of protection, concluding that strategically managed
   forest corridors must be a key component of lemur and other biodiversity
   conservation strategies. This recommendation is all the more urgent
   given that the results presented here do not take into account patterns
   of ongoing habitat destruction relating to human activities.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the present biodiversity crisis have been largely focused
   on the loss of species. However, a missed component of biodiversity loss
   that often accompanies or even precedes species disappearance is the
   extinction of ecological interactions. Here, we propose a novel model
   that (i) relates the diversity of both species and interactions along a
   gradient of environmental deterioration and (ii) explores how the rate
   of loss of ecological functions, and consequently of ecosystem services,
   can be accelerated or restrained depending on how the rate of species
   loss covaries with the rate of interactions loss. We find that the loss
   of species and interactions are decoupled, such that ecological
   interactions are often lost at a higher rate. This implies that the loss
   of ecological interactions may occur well before species disappearance,
   affecting species functionality and ecosystems services at a faster rate
   than species extinctions. We provide a number of empirical case studies
   illustrating these points. Our approach emphasizes the importance of
   focusing on species interactions as the major biodiversity component
   from which the health' of ecosystems depends.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{573-587}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between ecological impact and ecosystem structure is
   often strongly nonlinear, so that small increases in impact levels can
   cause a disproportionately large response in ecosystem structure.
   Nonlinear ecosystem responses can be difficult to predict because
   locally relevant data sets can be difficult or impossible to obtain.
   Bayesian networks (BN) are an emerging tool that can help managers to
   define ecosystem relationships using a range of data types from
   comprehensive quantitative data sets to expert opinion. We show how a
   simple BN can reveal nonlinear dynamics in seagrass ecosystems using
   ecological relationships sourced from the literature. We first developed
   a conceptual diagram by cataloguing the ecological responses of
   seagrasses to a range of drivers and impacts. We used the conceptual
   diagram to develop a BN populated with values sourced from published
   studies. We then applied the BN to show that the amount of initial
   seagrass biomass has a mitigating effect on the level of impact a meadow
   can withstand without loss, and that meadow recovery can often require
   disproportionately large improvements in impact levels. This mitigating
   effect resulted in the middle ranges of impact levels having a wide
   likelihood of seagrass presence, a situation known as bistability.
   Finally, we applied the model in a case study to identify the risk of
   loss and the likelihood of recovery for the conservation and management
   of seagrass meadows in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. We used the
   model to predict the likelihood of bistability in 23 locations in the
   Bay. The model predicted bistability in seven locations, most of which
   have experienced seagrass loss at some stage in the past 25 years
   providing essential information for potential future restoration
   efforts. Our results demonstrate the capacity of simple, flexible
   modeling tools to facilitate collation and synthesis of disparate
   information. This approach can be adopted in the initial stages of
   conservation programs as a low-cost and relatively straightforward way
   to provide preliminary assessments of nonlinear dynamics in ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid expansion of multicellular native and alien species outbreaks
   in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems (bioinvasions) may produce
   significant impacts on bacterial community dynamics and nutrient
   pathways with major ecological implications. In aquatic ecosystems,
   bioinvasions may cause adverse effects on the water quality resulting
   from changes in biological, chemical and physical properties linked to
   significant transformations of the microbial taxonomic and functional
   diversity. Here we used an effective and highly sensitive experimental
   strategy, bypassing the efficiency bottleneck of the traditional
   bacterial isolation and culturing method, to identify changes of the
   planktonic microbial community inhabiting a marine coastal lagoon
   (Varano, Adriatic Sea) under the influence of an outbreak-forming alien
   jellyfish species. Water samples were collected from two areas that
   differed in their level of confinement inside in the lagoon and
   jellyfish densities (W, up to 12.4 medusae m(-3); E, up to 0.03 medusae
   m(-3)) to conduct a snapshot microbiome analysis by a metagenomic
   approach. After extraction of the genetic material in the environmental
   water samples, we deep-sequenced metagenomic amplicons of the V5-V6
   region of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene by an Illumina MiSeq platform.
   Experiments were carried out in triplicates, so six libraries of dual
   indexed amplicons of 420 bp were successfully sequenced on the MiSeq
   platform using a 2 x 250 bp paired-end sequencing strategy.
   Approximately 7.5 million paired-end reads (i.e. 15 million total reads)
   were generated, with an average of 2.5 million reads (1.25 M pairs) per
   sample replicate. The sequence data, analyzed through a novel
   bioinformatics pipeline (BioMaS), showed that the structure of the
   resident bacterial community was significantly affected by the
   occurrence of jellyfish outbreaks. Clear qualitative and quantitative
   differences were found between the western and eastern areas
   (characterized by many or few jellyfish), with 84 families, 153 genera
   and 324 species in the W samples, and 104 families, 199 genera and 331
   species in the E samples. Significant differences between the two
   sampling areas were particularly detected in the occurrence of 16
   families, 22 genera and 61 species of microbial taxa. This is the first
   time that a NGS platform has been used to screen the impact of jellyfish
   bioinvasions on the aquatic microbiome, providing a preliminary
   assessment of jellyfish-driven changes of the functional and structural
   microbial biodiversity.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1066-1077}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is likely to become an increasingly major obstacle to
   slowing the rate of species extinctions. Several new assessment
   approaches have been proposed for identifying climate-vulnerable
   species, based on the assumption that established systems such as the
   IUCN Red List need revising or replacing because they were not developed
   to explicitly consider climate change. However, no assessment approach
   has been tested to determine its ability to provide advanced warning
   time for conservation action for species that might go extinct due to
   climate change. To test the performance of the Red List system in this
   capacity, we used linked niche-demographic models with habitat dynamics
   driven by a business-as-usual' climate change scenario. We generated
   replicate 100-year trajectories for range-restricted reptiles and
   amphibians endemic to the United States. For each replicate, we
   categorized the simulated species according to IUCN Red List criteria at
   annual, 5-year, and 10-year intervals (the latter representing current
   practice). For replicates that went extinct, we calculated warning time
   as the number of years the simulated species was continuously listed in
   a threatened category prior to extinction. To simulate data limitations,
   we repeated the analysis using a single criterion at a time
   (disregarding other listing criteria). Results show that when all
   criteria can be used, the Red List system would provide several decades
   of warning time (median=62years; >20years for 99\% of replicates), but
   suggest that conservation actions should begin as soon as a species is
   listed as Vulnerable, because 50\% of replicates went extinct within
   20years of becoming uplisted to Critically Endangered. When only one
   criterion was used, warning times were substantially shorter, but more
   frequent assessments increased the warning time by about a decade.
   Overall, we found that the Red List criteria reliably provide a
   sensitive and precautionary way to assess extinction risk under climate
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Many evolutionary analyses assume that the positions of species
   geographic ranges are sufficiently phylogenetically conserved that
   current ranges reflect ancestral ranges and retain the historic signal
   of speciation. The validity of this assumption has been challenged,
   because there is evidence that ranges can shift rapidly and extensively.
   Here I test the assumption of range conservatism using simulations and
   empirical tests of phylogenetic signal in geographic positions of ranges
   within mammal orders, families, and genera. In most taxa, range
   positions show strong phylogenetic signal, quantified using Pagel's ,
   Mantel tests, and a novel method to measure phylogenetic signal near the
   tips of a phylogeny. Taxa with highly labile range positions are
   exceptions to the general pattern and include very young groups such as
   Sciurus that may still be in the early, rapid-expansion phase of
   adaptive radiation. In two orders containing many species with large
   distributions (Artiodactyla and Carnivora), temporal patterns of range
   evolution are consistent with large instantaneous shifts in range
   position associated with allopatric speciation. In most other taxa,
   range evolution is better described by models that allow ranges to
   evolve along branches of the phylogeny. The results point to a common
   pattern of phylogenetically conserved ranges where the current position
   of species ranges reflects their position at the time of speciation,
   modified by gradual drift of range boundaries through time.}},

Abstract = {{Risk assessment tools for non-native species can avert ecological and
   economic harm when they inform regulatory or voluntary management
   actions that seek to reduce the probability of introducing high-risk
   species. The Laurentian Great Lakes region contains many aquatic
   invasive plants, non-native species whose introduction causes economic
   or environmental harm or harm to human health. Additionally, new species
   continue to arrive, including through trade (e.g., aquarium, water
   garden). Currently, each Great Lakes jurisdiction manages a separate
   risk assessment program, leading to a regional situation with diverse
   assessment methods and large discrepancies in assessed and regulated
   species. Because the Great Lakes ecosystem crosses state and national
   borders, each jurisdiction will be best protected when all jurisdictions
   prevent the import of potentially harmful species. We have modified an
   existing risk assessment tool for use across the Great Lakes Basin to
   assess the invasion risks posed by aquatic plants. The tool comprises 38
   questions, with points associated with each response that are summed to
   give a total score. We assessed all known established aquatic plant
   species in the Great Lakes (n=40) and found this score to be positively
   correlated with invasiveness, allowing thresholds to be identified that
   distinguish between invasive and non-invasive species with 84\% to 90\%
   accuracy. Assessing species proposed for introduction with this tool,
   and using these thresholds to determine acceptable risk, could reduce
   the number of future invasions. If widely adopted, this risk assessment
   tool would enable a common suite of species to be regulated and thus a
   more effective approach to reducing the risk of future invasions.
   Regional risk assessment approaches should reduce the threat of invasive
   species where environmental and climate conditions are relatively
   consistent across jurisdictional boundaries.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, the assessment of ecosystem services (ES) supply has
   been based on the use of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) data as proxies for
   spatial representation of ecosystems. Nevertheless, some shortcomings of
   this method, such as uncertainties derived from generalization of the
   ecosystem types and assumptions of invariance across spatial scales,
   indicate the need for new approaches. Such approaches could be aimed at
   improving knowledge of the relationships between ecosystem services and
   landscape structure and the spatial characteristics of ES patterns. In
   this study, we propose an integrative approach that involves the
   generation and analysis of continuous maps representing the supply of
   five ES potentially related to the amount of biomass. Five remote
   sensing images of the Northwestern Iberian Peninsula, obtained with
   Landsat-5 TM, were used to generate a proxy for net primary production
   by combining the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of each
   image to calculate a INDVI index that could act as a potential indicator
   of some ecosystem services. This information was combined with three
   variables terrain slope, population density and occurrence of protected
   areas to produce spatial models for the five ES and eventually a series
   of five supply maps. Food, materials and energy provision services
   showed a clustered pattern, with high supply values in flat zones and
   areas with high population densities. In contrast, mass flow and climate
   regulation services were more widely distributed throughout the study
   area. The five ecosystem service patterns were analyzed at different
   scales by two methods: lacunarity and four term local quadrat variance
   (4TLQV) analysis. These methods revealed differences in the spatial
   pattern: lacunarity analysis was useful for detection of scale
   thresholds at the local level, whereas 4TLQV was more sensitive to scale
   thresholds at larger spatial levels. Thus, the variance analysis yielded
   higher values for larger windows sizes, particularly for provisioning
   services. The results demonstrated the suitability of the proposed
   approach for the spatially explicit modeling of ecosystem services,
   avoiding the uncertainty of other assessments such as those based on
   LULC data, and for the exploratory analysis of ES supply from a spatial
   point of view. (C)) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The potential evapotranspiration (PET) that would occur with unlimited
   plant access to water is a central driver of simulated plant growth in
   many ecological models. PET is influenced by solar and longwave
   radiation, temperature, wind speed, and humidity, but it is often
   modeled as a function of temperature alone. This approach can cause
   biases in projections of future climate impacts in part because it
   confounds the effects of warming due to increased greenhouse gases with
   that which would be caused by increased radiation from the sun. We
   developed an algorithm for linking PET to extraterrestrial solar
   radiation (incoming top-of atmosphere solar radiation), as well as
   temperature and atmospheric water vapor pressure, and incorporated this
   algorithm into the dynamic global vegetation model MC1. We tested the
   new algorithm for the Northern Great Plains, USA, whose remaining
   grasslands are threatened by continuing woody encroachment. Both the new
   and the standard temperature-dependent MC1 algorithm adequately
   simulated current PET, as compared to the more rigorous PenPan model of
   Rotstayn et al. (2006). However, compared to the standard algorithm, the
   new algorithm projected a much more gradual increase in PET over the
   21st century for three contrasting future climates. This difference led
   to lower simulated drought effects and hence greater woody encroachment
   with the new algorithm, illustrating the importance of more rigorous
   calculations of PET in ecological models dealing with climate change.

Abstract = {{Rising sea levels and changing wind climates are widely expected to be
   associated with receding coastlines, creating a planning need for
   coastal change prediction, especially for soft shores like those
   associated with saltmarsh. We ask whether it is possible use a simple
   cartographic wind-wave fetch method to estimate the spatial pattern of
   progradation and recession of soft shores in swell-sheltered situations
   in which there is little or no input of new sediment from terrestrial
   sources. For points on an extensive embayment shoreline of this type we
   mapped change over 54 years from aerial photographs, recorded current
   shoreline morphology and calculated a wave fetch index (WFI).
   Morphological indication of strong progradation was associated with low
   WFI, but there was no statistically significant effect of variation in
   WFI on the degree of shoreline retreat. Saltmarsh shorelines averaged 14
   cm per annum retreat between 1952 and 2006, a rate that did not vary
   significantly between air photo periods. We conclude that our geographic
   information system approach utilising WFI is likely to be useful as a
   planning tool in identifying those parts of sediment-poor saltmarsh
   shores where erosion is most likely or least likely to occur, but not
   particularly useful for predicting finer-scale variation in rates of
   shoreline recession within the particular substrate types in our study
   area. In the context of relative sea-level rise and increasing wind
   speeds, such modelling can help identify coastlines which are likely to
   support saltmarshes into the future.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand the observed performance of demand-side approaches
   on residential electricity use, we develop and apply a mixed regression
   model of electricity consumption that includes marginal, joint technical
   change for multiple residential electricity end-uses (air conditioning,
   appliances, devices, and electric vehicles). Results indicate that the
   relative technical state of a home can significantly influence the
   performance of demand-side interventions, particularly the presence of a
   programmable thermostat. Within air conditioning, we generally find that
   ``enough{''} consistent technical improvement is needed to realize
   energy savings, which could be due to engineering building performance
   or a declining marginal rebound effect as householders become thermally
   comfortable. Results indicate that homeowners do not leverage efficiency
   gains for appliance services but demonstrate mixed results when
   considering the expansion of electricity services. Householders may
   rebound into device loads, albeit such results are not statistically
   significant. However, results indicate that householders do not leverage
   efficiency gains for electric vehicles. These results demonstrate that
   the net effect of technological change in households is relative to a
   home's baseline technical efficiency and the degree to which homeowners
   seek new and existing energy services, challenging empirical assessments
   that do not control for the technical state of multiple end uses. (C)

Abstract = {{Modeling population dynamics while accounting for imperfect detection is

   underlying population dynamics to estimate demographic parameters from
   repeated distance sampling surveys. Using a simulation study motivated
   by designing a monitoring program for Island Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma
   insularis), we investigated the power of this model to detect population
   trends. We generated temporally autocorrelated abundance and distance
   sampling data over six surveys, using population rates of change of 0.95
   and 0.90. We fit the data generating Markovian model and a mis-specified
   model with a log-linear time effect on abundance, and derived post hoc
   trend estimates from a model estimating abundance for each survey
   separately. We performed these analyses for varying numbers of survey
   points. Power to detect population changes was consistently greater

Abstract = {{Seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) is a conceptual framework that aims
   at quantifying the contribution of seed dispersal vectors to plant
   fitness. While it is well recognized that diplochorous dispersal
   systems, characterized by two successive dispersal steps performed by
   two different vectors (Phase I=primary seed dispersal and Phase
   II=secondary seed dispersal) which are common in temperate and tropical
   regions, little attention has been given to distinguishing the relative
   contribution of one-phase and two-phase dispersal to overall SDE. This
   conceptual gap probably results from the lack of a clear methodology to
   include Phase II dispersal into the calculation of SDE and to quantify
   its relative contribution. We propose a method to evaluate the relative
   contribution of one-phase and two-phase dispersal to SDE and determine
   whether two seed dispersers are better than one. To do so, we used the
   SDE landscape and an extension of the SDE landscape, the Phase II effect
   landscape, which measures the direction and magnitude of the Phase II
   dispersal effect on overall SDE. We used simulated and empirical data
   from a diplochorous dispersal system in the Peruvian Amazon to
   illustrate this new approach. Our approach provides the relative
   contribution of one-phase SDE (SDE1) and two-phase SDE (SDE2) to overall
   SDE and quantifies how much SDE changes with the addition of Phase II
   dispersal. Considering that the seed dispersal process is context
   dependent so that Phase II depends on Phase I, we predict the possible
   range of variation of SDE according to the variation of the probability
   of Phase II dispersal. In our specific study system composed of two
   primate species as primary dispersal vectors and different species of
   dung beetles as secondary dispersal vectors, the relative contribution
   of SDE1 and SDE2 to overall SDE varied between plant species. We discuss
   the context dependency of the Phase II dispersal and the potential
   applications of our approach. This extension to the conceptual framework
   of SDE enables quantitative evaluation of the effect of Phase II
   dispersal on plant fitness and can be easily adapted to other biotic
   and/or abiotic diplochorous dispersal systems.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory microcosm experiments using protists as model organisms have

   biological organization. This includes measurements of body size,
   mobility or abundance, in order to understand population dynamics,
   dispersal behaviour and ecosystem processes. Also, a variety of
   manipulations are employed, such as temperature changes or varying
   connectivity in spatial microcosm networks. Past studies, however, have
   used varying methods for maintenance, measurement, and manipulation,
   which hinders across-study comparisons and meta-analyses, and the added
   value they bring. Furthermore, application of techniques such as flow

Abstract = {{Native flora and fauna species continue to decline in the megadiverse,
   wealthy, economically and politically stable nation of Australia despite
   current efforts in policy and management. Ongoing research is examining
   these declines, their causes and the adequacy of current policy, but
   strategies for improving the outcomes for threatened species have
   attracted less attention. We discuss several key aspects of Australia's
   national threatened species management approach that potentially hinder
   the efficiency and effectiveness of management: the threatened species
   listing process is lengthy and biased; recovery plan development is
   resource intensive, restricted to a subset of species and often not
   effective; funding for threatened species management is not allocated
   efficiently or transparently; and management is not designed to
   incorporate uncertainties and adapt to changing future threats. Based on
   these issues we recommend four changes to current process: rationalize
   listing and assessment processes; develop approaches to prioritize
   species-based and threat-based responses cost-effectively; estimate
   funds required to recover species and secure longer term funding; and
   accommodate uncertainties and new threats into the current planning
   framework. Cost-effective prioritization for species and threats
   identifies which actions are likely to achieve the greatest benefits to
   species per unit cost, thereby managing more species and threats with
   available funds. These improvements can be made without legislative
   reform, additional funding or socio-economic shifts. If implemented, we
   believe more Australian threatened species will benefit from current
   efforts. Many of the challenges facing Australia are analogous to issues
   in other countries including the United States, Canada and the United
   Kingdom and these recommendations could assist in improving threatened
   species management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hitherto fungi have rarely been considered in conservation biology, but

   animals and plants. We reviewed the role of fungi in ecosystems and
   composed an overview of the current state of conservation of fungi.
   There are 5 areas in which fungi can be readily integrated into
   conservation: as providers of habitats and processes important for other
   organisms; as indicators of desired or undesired trends in ecosystem
   functioning; as indicators of habitats of conservation value; as
   providers of powerful links between human societies and the natural
   world because of their value as food, medicine, and biotechnological
   tools; and as sources of novel tools and approaches for conservation of
   megadiverse organism groups. We hope conservation professionals will

   conforme la disciplina cambia su enfoque en problemas de especies
   individuales hacia una estrategia integrada basada en los ecosistemas.

   papeles cruciales en los ecosistemas terrestres y los beneficios de
   considerar a los hongos en sintonia con las plantas y los animales.
   Revisamos el papel de los hongos en los ecosistemas y elaboramos un
   resumen del estado actual de su conservacion. Hay cinco areas en las
   cuales los hongos pueden integrarse inmediatamente en la conservacion:
   como proveedores de habitats y procesos importantes para otros
   organismos; como indicadores de tendencias deseadas o indeseadas en el
   funcionamiento del ecosistema; como indicadores de habitats con valor de
   conservacion; como proveedores de enlaces fuertes entre las sociedades
   humanas y el mundo natural debido a sus valores como alimento, medicinas
   y herramientas biotecnologicas; y como una fuente de herramientas y
   estrategias novedosas para la conservacion de grupos megadiversos de

Abstract = {{Understanding ecosystem responses to global and local anthropogenic
   impacts is paramount to predicting future ecosystem states. We used an
   ecosystem modeling approach to investigate the independent and
   cumulative effects of fishing, marine protection, and ocean
   acidification on a coastal ecosystem. To quantify the effects of ocean
   acidification at the ecosystem level, we used information from the
   peer-reviewed literature on the effects of ocean acidification. Using an
   Ecopath with Ecosim ecosystem model for the Wellington south coast,
   including the Taputeranga Marine Reserve (MR), New Zealand, we predicted
   ecosystem responses under 4 scenarios: ocean acidification + fishing;
   ocean acidification + MR (no fishing); no ocean acidification + fishing;
   no ocean acidification + MR for the year 2050. Fishing had a larger
   effect on trophic group biomasses and trophic structure than ocean
   acidification, whereas the effects of ocean acidification were only
   large in the absence of fishing. Mortality by fishing had large,
   negative effects on trophic group biomasses. These effects were similar
   regardless of the presence of ocean acidification. Ocean acidification
   was predicted to indirectly benefit certain species in the MR scenario.
   This was because lobster (Jasus edwardsii) only recovered to 58\% of the
   MR biomass in the ocean acidification + MR scenario, a situation that
   benefited the trophic groups lobsters prey on. Most trophic groups
   responded antagonistically to the interactive effects of ocean
   acidification and marine protection (46\%; reduced response); however,
   many groups responded synergistically (33\%; amplified response).
   Conservation and fisheries management strategies need to account for the
   reduced recovery potential of some exploited species under ocean
   acidification, nonadditive interactions of multiple factors, and
   indirect responses of species to ocean acidification caused by declines
   in calcareous predators.
   Efectos Futuros de la Acidificacion Oceanica, la Pesca y la Proteccion
   Marina sobre un Ecosistema Costero Templado Entender las respuestas
   ambientales a los impactos antropogenicos globales y locales es
   primordial para predecir los estados futuros de los ecosistemas. Usamos
   una estrategia de modelado de ecosistemas para investigar los efectos
   independientes y acumulativos de la pesca, la proteccion marina y la
   acidificacion oceanica sobre un ecosistema costero. Para cuantificar los
   efectos de la acidificacion oceanica en el nivel de ecosistema, usamos
   informacion de la literatura revisada por colegas sobre los efectos de
   la acidificacion oceanica. Al usar un modelo de ecosistema Ecopath con
   Ecosim para la costa sur de Wellington, incluyendo la Reserva Marina
   Taputeranga (RM), Nueva Zelanda, pronosticamos las respuestas
   ambientales bajo cuatro escenarios: acidificacion oceanica + pesca;
   acidificacion oceanica + reservas marinas (RM) (sin pesca); ninguna
   acidificacion oceanica + pesca; ninguna acidificacion oceanica + RM para
   el ano 2050. La pesca tuvo un mayor efecto sobre la biomasa de los
   grupos troficos y sobre la estructura trofica que la acidificacion
   oceanica, mientras que los efectos de la acidificacion oceanica solo
   fueron mayores en la ausencia de la pesca. La mortandad por pesca tuvo
   efectos negativos mayores sobre la biomasa de los grupos troficos. Estos
   efectos fueron similares sin importar la presencia de la acidificacion

Title = {{Impact of quarrying on genetic diversity: an approach across landscapes

Abstract = {{Land conversion is one of the major global changes that threaten
   population viability. As with many industrial activities, quarrying
   highly modifies land cover, destroying previous habitats but also
   creating new conditions potentially supporting functioning and
   connectivity of pioneer species. Using a multi-landscape and -temporal
   approach, we assessed the impact of quarrying on the genetic diversity
   of two amphibians with contrasted ecological constraints: the common
   toad (Bufo bufo) and the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita), favouring
   vegetated and pioneer environments, respectively. The study was
   conducted across six areas of ca. 250 km(2) each. Mixed effect models
   were used to determine which landscape features affect the genetic
   diversity of the two species. These analyses were performed at three
   time points (1940s, 1970s and 2000s). Genetic diversity of B. bufo was
   found to increase with the area of semi-wooded and herbaceous
   vegetation, and decrease with the area of roads and urbanized areas.
   Genetic diversity of B. calamita increased with the area of bare ground
   and of quarries, and decreased with the area of dense woods. We found no
   effect of quarrying on B. bufo, unlike for B. calamita in which genetic
   diversity was favoured by quarrying at all three time-points. Despite
   having similar generation times, B. bufo's diversity was best explained
   by 1940s landscape and that of B. calamita by 2000s landscape. This
   study enlightens the genetic conservation value of quarries for pioneer
   species and the possible delays between landscape changes and their
   effects on the populations of some, but not all, species.}},

Abstract = {{Methodological absences, i.e. when a species is not detected although it
   is actually present, are known to reduce the prediction accuracy of
   species distribution models (SDMs). To deal with this problem, we
   assessed whether a new iterative ensemble modelling (IEM) approach
   better predicts the spatial distribution of a set of 31 freshwater fish
   species, exhibiting a wide range of prevalence and methodological
   absences. Model efficiency was compared using one threshold-independent
   (AUC) and three threshold-dependent indicators of model predictive
   performance: the percentage of misclassified sites; the Kappa index; and
   the True Skill Statistic. We then reconstructed species assemblages from
   individual species predictions and compared observed assemblages to
   those predicted using EM and IEM using the Jaccard index. Compared to an
   EM approach, IEM improved model predictive performance for most
   difficult-to-detect species. The iterative approach outperformed EM at
   modelling the distribution of difficult-to-detect species, provided that
   presence data are representative of the niche of the species. At the
   assemblage level, the discrepancy between observed and IEM predicted
   assemblages was significantly lower than that between observed and EM
   predicted assemblages, showing that IEM can be used to predict the
   distribution of entire species assemblages. The IEM approach provides a
   way to consider difficult-to-detect species in species distribution
   models.}},

Title = {{Keystone species: toward an operational concept for marine biodiversity
   conservation}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{29-47}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Various definitions and indices have been proposed in the literature to
   identify keystone species. In this study, we intended to make the
   concept of keystone species operational for marine biodiversity
   conservation. We used an exclusive definition of keystone species, based
   on the original concept of keystone predator, and derived a new
   functional index of keystoneness (KS) from an ecosystem-modeling
   approach. First, several KS indices were formulated, by combining
   measures of the mixed-trophic impact (MTI) and biomass of species. Then,
   a meta-analysis was performed, based on 101 published Ecopath food-web
   models, selected with a scoring method, and representative of the
   variety of marine ecosystems worldwide. The indices were applied to the
   models, and two statistical methods were compared to select the most
   promising KS index. Rank correlation tests were performed to assess the
   balance between the contribution of the impact and biomass components to
   the different KS indices. In addition, a classification tree was
   implemented, based on ecosystem-specific thresholds applied to the
   latter species traits, and used to confirm the identified keystone
   species. The selected index obtained the highest number of models with
   positive results from both the rank correlation tests and the
   classification tree. We also demonstrated the limitations of existing KS
   indices previously applied in the literature. Species were ranked
   according to their estimates of keystoneness with the selected KS index,
   so that potential keystone species were quantitatively identified in the
   101 modeled food webs. The standardized modeling approach allowed for a
   comparison of the identified keystone species across models:
   cartilaginous fishes and toothed whales obtained the highest
   occurrences. Finally, the selected KS index was applied to the
   well-known case study of Prince William Sound (Alaska, USA). Potentially
   significant anthropogenic (fishing) impacts on keystone species were
   also considered and discussed. The operational methodology presented is
   directly applicable to marine food webs, and may be adapted to other
   (freshwater or terrestrial) systems.}},

Title = {{How limiting factors drive agricultural adaptation to climate change}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{200}},
Pages = {{178-185}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Consensus is growing that agriculture is vulnerable to climate change
   and adaptation responses are necessary to minimize impacts. Nonetheless,
   the diversity of potential impacts, agro-ecological contexts and
   regional capacity for change make understanding adaptation behaviors
   challenging and ensure that climate change adaptation will not be the
   same across all contexts. Considering this heterogeneity, this paper
   aims to develop a theoretical approach to connect agro-ecosystem
   diversity with farmer decisionmaking in the context of agricultural
   adaptation to climate change. We combine the ecological principle of
   Liebig's Law of the Minimum with the Psychological Distance Theory to
   suggest how adaptation behaviors vary across regional contexts. We argue
   with our limiting factors hypothesis that limiting factors within a farm
   system (water or temperature impacts) influence the adoption of
   adaptation practices differently across regions and farm systems.
   Limiting factors varied across farm systems and regions, based on
   historical climate changes, agro-ecological contexts, infrastructure and
   adaptation capacity. Using farmer survey data from New Zealand we show
   that limiting factors mediate the effect of past climate experiences on
   the adoption of adaptation strategies differently in two regions with
   water acting as a limiting factor in Hawke's Bay and water and
   temperature as a limiting factor in Marlborough. This suggests that
   farmers perceive and respond to climate change in part due to their
   personal experiences with climate change and the limiting factors within
   their system. Such results are relevant for the development of regional
   adaptation strategies, effective policies and targeted climate change

Abstract = {{Acoustic deterrent devices (ADDs) have often been considered a benign
   solution to managing pinniped predation. However, ADDs have also been
   highlighted as a conservation concern since they can inflict large-scale
   habitat exclusion in toothed whales (odontocetes). We tested a new
   method that selectively inflicted startle responses in harbour seals
   (Phoca vitulina) at close ranges to the loudspeaker but not in a
   non-target species, the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), by using a
   frequency range where porpoise hearing was less sensitive than that of
   phocid seals. The sound exposure consisted of isolated 200ms long, 2-3
   octave-band noise pulses with a peak frequency of 1kHz, which were
   presented at a source level of approximate to 180dB re 1Pa. Field tests
   were carried out within a 2-month period on a fish farm on the west
   coast of Scotland where marine mammal behaviour was observed within
   three distance categories. Seal numbers dropped sharply during sound
   exposure compared with control observation periods within 250m of the
   sound source but were unaffected at distances further away from the
   farm. A Poisson regression model revealed that the number of seal tracks
   within 250m of the device decreased by approximate to 91\% during sound
   exposure and was primarily influenced by sound exposure with no evidence
   for a change in the effect of treatment such as habituation, throughout
   the experiment. In contrast to seals, there was no shift in the number
   of porpoise groups in each distance category as a result of sound
   exposure and porpoises were regularly seen close to the device. We also
   sighted six common minke whales during sound exposure while only one was
   seen during control periods. Our data demonstrate that the startle
   method can be used to selectively deter seals without affecting
   porpoises.}},

Abstract = {{Fundamental drivers of ecosystem processes such as temperature and
   precipitation are rapidly changing and creating novel environmental
   conditions. Forest landscape models (FLM) are used by managers and
   policy-makers to make projections of future ecosystem dynamics under
   alternative management or policy options, but the links between the
   fundamental drivers and projected responses are weak and indirect,
   limiting their reliability for projecting the impacts of climate change.
   We developed and tested a relatively mechanistic method to simulate the
   effects of changing precipitation on species competition within the
   LANDIS-II FLM. Using data from a field precipitation manipulation
   experiment in a pinon pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus
   monosperma) ecosystem in New Mexico (USA), we calibrated our model to
   measurements from ambient control plots and tested predictions under the
   drought and irrigation treatments against empirical measurements. The
   model successfully predicted behavior of physiological variables under
   the treatments. Discrepancies between model output and empirical data
   occurred when the monthly time step of the model failed to capture the
   short-term dynamics of the ecosystem as recorded by instantaneous field
   measurements. We applied the model to heuristically assess the effect of
   alternative climate scenarios on the pinon-juniper ecosystem and found
   that warmer and drier climate reduced productivity and increased the
   risk of drought-induced mortality, especially for pinon. We concluded
   that the direct links between fundamental drivers and growth rates in
   our model hold great promise to improve our understanding of ecosystem
   processes under climate change and improve management decisions because
   of its greater reliance on first principles.}},

Abstract = {{Automated recorders and occupancy models can be used together to monitor
   population trends of multiple avian species across a large geographic
   region. Automated recorders are an attractive method for monitoring
   birds, because they leave a record that can be independently validated
   and multiple units can be programmed to repeatedly survey different
   locations at the same daily times. We assessed the use of automated
   recorders and single-species, single-season occupancy models to monitor
   common forest birds across a 5.4-million-ha region of northern
   California. Using a survey protocol of 5-minute recordings at 3 times of
   the morning repeated over 3 consecutive days at 453 sites, we detected
   32 species at >10\% of these sites. Five of these species (Steller's jay
   {[}Cyanocitta stelleri], mountain chickadee {[}Poecile gambeli],
   red-breasted nuthatch {[}Sitta canadensis], dark-eyed junco {[}Junco
   hyemalis], and western tanager {[}Piranga ludoviciana]) were dominant
   with occupancies >0.5. We also modeled occupancy associations with
   elevation and canopy cover for brown creeper (Certhia americana),
   MacGillivray's warbler (Geothlypis tolmiei), and western tanager and
   found the environmental conditions at which occupancy was maximized
   differed by up to 399m in elevation and 17.9\% canopy cover for these
   species. Given a sampling effort of 100 new sites per year, we
   demonstrated 80\% power (=0.1) to detect occupancy declines as small as
   2.5\% per year over 20 years for the 32 most common species. The
   effective radius of automated recorder surveys was approximately 50m. In
   a field test, surveys conducted concurrently using automated recorders
   and point counts yielded similar occupancy estimates despite differences
   in detection probability. Our results suggest that automated recorders,
   used alone or in conjunction with point counts, can provide a practical
   means of monitoring common forest birds across a large geographic area.

Abstract = {{An important focus of biosecurity is anticipating future risks, but time
   lags between introduction, naturalisation, and (ultimately) impact mean
   that future risks can be strongly influenced by history. We conduct a
   comprehensive historical analysis of tropical grasses (n = 155) that
   have naturalised in Australia since European settlement (1788) to
   determine what factors shaped historical patterns of naturalisation and
   future risks, including for the 21 species that cause serious negative
   impacts. Most naturalised species were from the Old World (78 \%), were
   introduced for use in pasture (64.5 \%), were first recorded prior to
   1940 (84.5 \%) and naturalised before 1980 (90.3 \%). Patterns for
   high-impact species were similar, with all being first recorded in
   Australia by 1940, and only seven naturalised since then-five
   intentionally introduced as pasture species. Counter to expectations, we
   found no evidence for increased naturalisation with increasing trade,
   including for species introduced unintentionally for which the link was
   expected to be strongest. New pathways have not emerged since the 1930s
   despite substantial shifts in trading patterns. Furthermore,
   introduction and naturalisation rates are now at or approaching
   historically low levels. Three reasons were identified: (1) the often
   long lag phase between introduction and reported naturalisation means
   naturalisation rates reflect historical trends in introduction rates;
   (2) important introduction pathways are not directly related to trade
   volume and globalisation; and (3) that species pools may become
   depleted. The last of these appears to be the case for the most
   important pathway for tropical grasses, i.e. the intentional
   introduction of useful pasture species. Assuming that new pathways don't
   arise that might result in increased naturalisation rates, and that
   current at-border biosecurity practices remain in place, we conclude
   that most future high-impact tropical grass species are already present
   in Australia. Our results highlight the need to continually test
   underlying assumptions regarding future naturalisation rates of
   high-impact invasive species, as conclusions have important implications
   for how best to manage future biosecurity risks.}},

Abstract = {{The flow regime of a river is fundamental in determining its ecological
   characteristics. Impoundment of rivers has been documented to severely
   impact the natural flow regime, resulting in abiotic and biotic changes
   in downstream ecosystems. Contemporary water legislation is driving
   increasing concern among environmentalists and water resource managers
   with respect to how these impacts can be mitigated. This has stimulated
   research aimed at assessing the relationship between reservoir outflow
   modification (i.e. managed environmental flows) and downstream ecosystem
   responses. We carried out a critical review and synthesis of the global
   literature concerning post-impoundment reservoir outflow modification
   and associated downstream biotic and abiotic responses. Seventy-six
   studies published between 1981 and 2012 were analysed. In contrast to
   previous studies of this subject, we systematically assessed the
   methodological quality of research to identify strengths and weaknesses
   of the approaches. We also undertook a novel quantification of ecosystem
   responses to flow modification, thus enabling identification of
   priorities for future research. We identified that: (i) there was a
   research bias towards North American and Western European studies; (ii)
   the majority of studies reported changes in flow magnitude (e.g.
   artificial floods) and primarily focused on traditionally monitored
   ecological groups (e.g. fish); (iii) relationships between flow, biota
   (e.g. macroinvertebrates) and water quality (e.g. electrical
   conductivity and suspended solids concentration) were evident,
   demonstrating the potential for managed environmental flows to
   manipulate river ecosystems; (iv) site-specific factors (e.g. location,
   climate) are likely to be important as some ecosystem responses were
   inconsistent between studies (e.g. fish movement in response to
   increases in flow magnitude); and (v) quality of study design,
   methodological and analytical techniques varied, and these factors may
   have contributed to the reported variability of ecosystem response. To
   advance scientific understanding and guide future management of
   regulated flow regimes, we highlight a pressing need for: (i)
   diversification of study locations as well as flow modification and
   ecosystem response types assessed; (ii) a focus on understanding
   flow-ecosystem response relationships at regional scales; (iii) further
   quantitative studies to enable robust statistical analyses in future
   meta-analyses; and (iv) robust monitoring of flow experiments and the
   use of contemporary statistical techniques to extract maximum knowledge
   from ecological response data.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological models are powerful tools for generating predictions about
   the viability of populations of endangered species, especially in
   landscapes where they may be subject to complex, cross-scale
   disturbances. Spatially explicit, individual-based approaches are
   particularly promising due to their ability to simulate the effect of
   landscape level changes in habitat on individual-level behaviour, thus
   predicting possible emergent responses from the bottom up. We apply this
   approach to modelling the movement behaviour and the complex life cycles
   of two species of stream-dwelling salamanders (the Allegheny Mountain
   Dusky Salamander, Desmognathus ochrophaeus, and the Northern Spring
   Salamander, Gyrinophilus porphyriticus) in response to a spatially and
   temporally varying environment. Despite the poor state of ecological
   knowledge about these species, our model provides reasonable predictions
   about life cycle, as well as the density and distribution of
   salamanders. When tested with a dynamic, drought prone environment, the
   model predicts viability levels that are biologically plausible. By
   simulating the cross-scale interactions between organisms and their
   environment, individual-based models such as we have developed here
   provide a new tool for in silico investigations of the expected impacts
   of varying landscape scenarios and environmental changes. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Pest risk maps are an important source of decision support when devising
   strategies to minimize introductions of invasive organisms and mitigate
   their impacts. When possible management responses to an invader include
   costly or socially sensitive activities, decision makers tend to follow
   a more certain (i.e. risk-averse) course of action. We present a new
   mapping technique that assesses pest invasion risk from the perspective
   of a risk-averse decision maker. We demonstrate the approach by
   evaluating the likelihood that an invasive forest pest will be
   transported to one of the continental US states or Canadian provinces in
   infested firewood that may be carried by visitors to US federal
   campgrounds. We test the impact of the risk aversion assumption using
   distributions of plausible pest arrival scenarios generated with a
   geographically explicit model developed from data documenting camper
   travel across the study area. Next, we prioritize regions of high and
   low pest arrival risk via application of two stochastic ordering
   techniques that employ, respectively, first-and second-degree stochastic
   dominance rules, the latter of which incorporates the notion of risk
   aversion. We then identify regions in the study area where incorporating
   risk aversion changes a region's pest risk value considerably.
   While both methods identified similar areas of highest and lowest risk,
   they differed in how they demarcated moderate-risk areas. Each method
   provides a tractable way to incorporate decision-making preferences into
   final risk estimates, and thus helps to better align these estimates
   with particular decision-making scenarios about an organism of concern.
   Overall, in corporation of risk aversion helps to refine the set of
   locations that could be confidently targeted for costly inspections and
   outreach activities.}},

Abstract = {{Pest risk maps can provide helpful decision support for invasive alien
   species management, but often fail to address adequately the uncertainty
   associated with their predicted risk values. This chapter explores how
   increased uncertainty in a risk model's numeric assumptions (i.e. its
   principal parameters) might affect the resulting risk map. We used a
   spatial stochastic model, integrating components for entry,
   establishment and spread, to estimate the risks of invasion and their
   variation across a two-dimensional gridded landscape for Sirex noctilio,
   a non-native woodwasp detected in eastern North America in 2004.
   Historically, S. noctilio has been a major pest of pine (Pinus spp.)
   plantations in the southern hemisphere. We present a sensitivity
   analysis of the mapped risk estimates to variation in six key model
   parameters: (i) the annual probabilities of new S. noctilio entries at
   US and Canadian ports; (ii) the S. noctilio population-carrying capacity
   at a given location; (iii) the maximum annual spread distance; (iv) the
   probability of local dispersal (i.e. at a distance of 1 km); (v) the
   susceptibility of the host resource; and (vi) the growth rate of the
   host trees. We used Monte Carlo simulation to sample values from
   symmetric uniform distributions defined by a series of nested
   variability bounds around each parameter's initial values (i.e. +/-5\%,
   ..., +/-50\%). The results show that maximum annual spread distance,
   which governs long-distance dispersal, was the most sensitive of the
   tested parameters. At +/-15\% uncertainty in this parameter, mapped risk
   values shifted notably. No other parameter had a major effect, even at
   wider bounds of variation. Th e methods presented in this chapter are
   generic and can be used to assess the impact of uncertainties on the
   stability of pest risk maps or to identify any geographic areas for

Abstract = {{Uncertainty is inherent in model-based forecasts of ecological
   invasions. In this chapter, we explore how the perceptions of that
   uncertainty can be incorporated into the pest risk assessment process.
   Uncertainty changes a decision maker's perceptions of risk; therefore,
   the direct incorporation of uncertainty may provide a more appropriate
   depiction of risk. Our methodology borrows basic concepts from portfolio
   valuation theory that were originally developed for the allocation of
   financial investments under uncertainty. In our case, we treat the
   model-based estimates of a pest invasion at individual geographical
   locations as analogous to a set of individual investment asset types
   that constitute a `portfolio'. We then estimate the highest levels of
   pest invasion risk by finding the subset of geographical locations with
   the `worst' combinations of a high likelihood of invasion and/or high
   uncertainty in the likelihood estimate. We illustrate the technique
   using a case study that applies a spatial pest transmission model to
   assess the likelihood that Canadian municipalities will receive invasive
   forest insects with commercial freight transported via trucks. The
   approach provides a viable strategy for dealing with the typical lack of
   knowledge about the behaviour of new invasive species and generally high
   uncertainty in model-based forecasts of ecological invasions. The
   technique is especially useful for under taking comparative risk
   assessments such as identification of geographical hot spots of pest
   invasion risk in large landscapes, or assessments for multiple species

Abstract = {{In compliance with the European Water Framework Directive, member states
   have had to develop a method to assess the quality of aquatic ecosystems
   by comparing the current situation regarding near natural reference
   conditions for each river type. In 2008, the Spanish Ministry of

   statement sets out reference conditions and ecological status class
   change limits for the different types of rivers in Spain for which
   sufficient data are available. In the present study, we established
   reference conditions and quality class thresholds for streams classified
   as wet Betic mountain rivers from 24 reaches of streams located in Los
   Alcornocales Natural Park, using two qualitative indices based on
   macroinvertebrates (IBMWP and IMMi-L). The results for the IBMWP index
   indicate that from the standpoint of management of the ecological state,
   the watercourses studied show more affinity with the types of the
   Spanish Atlantic siliceous slope than with those of the Mediterranean
   siliceous slope when we consider EQR values. Considering the threshold
   values, the index resembles siliceous low Mediterranean mountain rivers
   (type 8). However, the EQR values do not match those calculated in this
   study. These results suggest that it is necessary to use an index
   adapted to the characteristics of these watercourses. Application of the
   quality criteria contained in the Guadalete Barbate and Mediterranean
   Andalusian Basin Plans to the management of these waterways is
   discussed, because it is unlikely that they ensure the maintenance of
   good ecological status. We thus propose a new calibration of the IBMWP
   index that ensures the maintenance of good environmental status of
   watercourses in this natural area, and the use of the IMMi-L index as an
   effective management tool. However, as our study area represents only a
   part of the wet headwaters in the southern Iberian peninsula, analysis

Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) in the United States play an important
   role in the adaptation of social-ecological systems to climate change,
   land-use change, and other global-change processes. Coastal refuges are
   already experiencing threats from sea-level rise and other change
   processes that are largely beyond their ability to influence, while at
   the same time facing tighter budgets and reduced staff. We engaged in
   workshops with NWR managers along the U.S. Atlantic coast to understand
   the problems they face from global-change processes and began a
   multidisciplinary collaboration to use decision science to help address
   them. We are applying a values-focused approach to base management
   decisions on the resource objectives of land managers, as well as those
   of stakeholders who may benefit from the goods and services produced by
   a refuge. Two insights that emerged from our workshops were a
   conspicuous mismatch between the scale at which management can influence
   outcomes and the scale of environmental processes, and the need to
   consider objectives related to ecosystem goods and services that
   traditionally have not been explicitly considered by refuges (e.g.,
   protection from storm surge). The broadening of objectives complicates
   the decision-making process, but also provides opportunities for
   collaboration with stakeholders who may have agendas different from
   those of the refuge, as well as an opportunity for addressing problems
   across scales. From a practical perspective, we recognized the need to
   (1) efficiently allocate limited staff time and budgets for short-term
   management of existing programs and resources under the current refuge
   design and (2) develop long-term priorities for acquiring or protecting
   new land/habitat to supplement or replace the existing refuge footprint
   and thus sustain refuge values as the system evolves over time.
   Structuring the decision-making problem in this manner facilitated a
   better understanding of the issues of scale and suggested that a
   long-term solution will require a significant reassessment of objectives
   to better reflect the comprehensive values of refuges to society. We
   discuss some future considerations to integrate these two problems into
   a single framework by developing novel optimization approaches for
   dynamic problems that account for uncertainty in future conditions.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Concerned decision makers increasingly pose questions as to whether
   current management practices are able to cope with climate change and
   increased climate variability. This signifies a shift in the framing of
   climate change from asking what its potential impacts are to asking
   whether it induces policy failure and unacceptable change. In this
   paper, we explore the background, feasibility, and consequences of this
   new framing. We focus on the specific situation in which a
   social-political threshold of concern is likely to be exceeded as a
   result of climate change, requiring consideration of alternative
   strategies. Action is imperative when such a situation is conceivable,
   and at this point climate change becomes particularly relevant to
   decision makers. We call this situation an ``adaptation turning
   point.{''} The assessment of adaptation turning points converts
   uncertainty surrounding the extent of a climate impact into a time range
   over which it is likely that specific thresholds will be exceeded. This
   can then be used to take adaptive action. Despite the difficulty in
   identifying adaptation turning points and the relative newness of the
   approach, experience so far suggests that the assessment generates a
   meaningful dialogue between stakeholders and scientists. Discussion
   revolves around the amount of change that is acceptable; how likely it
   is that unacceptable, or more favorable, conditions will be reached; and
   the adaptation pathways that need to be considered under these
   circumstances. Defining and renegotiating policy objectives under
   climate change are important topics in the governance of adaptation.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the factors that shape adaptive genetic variation across
   species niches has become of paramount importance in evolutionary
   ecology, especially to understand how adaptation to changing climate
   affects the geographic range of species. The distribution of adaptive
   alleles in the ecological niche is determined by the emergence of novel
   mutations, their fitness consequences and gene flow that connects
   populations across species niches. Striking demographical differences
   and source sink dynamics of populations between the centre and the
   margin of the niche can play a major role in the emergence and spread of
   adaptive alleles. Although some theoretical predictions have long been
   proposed, the origin and distribution of adaptive alleles within species
   niches remain untested.
   In this paper, we propose and discuss a novel empirical approach that
   combines landscape genetics with species niche modelling, to test
   whether alleles that confer local adaptation are more likely to occur in
   either marginal or central populations of species niches. We illustrate
   this new approach by using a published data set of 21 alpine plant
   species genotyped with a total of 2483 amplified fragment length
   polymorphisms (AFLP), distributed over more than 1733 sampling sites
   across the Alps. Based on the assumption that alleles that were
   statistically associated with environmental variables were adaptive, we
   found that adaptive alleles in the margin of a species niche were also
   present in the niche centre, which suggests that adaptation originates
   in the niche centre.
   These findings corroborate models of species range evolution, in which
   the centre of the niche contributes to the emergence of novel adaptive
   alleles, which diffuse towards niche margins and facilitate niche and
   range expansion through subsequent local adaptation. Although these
   results need to be confirmed via fitness measurements in natural
   populations and functionally characterised genetic sequences, this study
   provides a first step towards understanding how adaptive genetic

Abstract = {{We present a new approach to the diversity of macrophyte communities
   based on species richness (S), Simpson's diversity index (SD), Rao's
   functional diversity (FD), functional attribute diversity (FAD) and the
   share of life history traits along a gradient of acidity in softwater
   lakes. On the basis of 10,800 cover-plant samples (squares with an area
   of 0.1 m(2)) collected from 241 sections of the bottom (depth belts) of
   38 lakes, four communities were identified using the TWINSPAN algorithm:
   moss carpet (median water pH 4.7), isoetids with acidophytic mosses (pH
   5.5), isoetids with neutrophytic mosses (pH 63) and neutrophytic
   vascular plants with charophytes (pH 7.1). Along a gradient of
   increasing pH, the diversity of communities increases and the species
   composition and share of life history traits are subject to significant
   changes. Evergreen, plagiotropic and unanchored plants with small, thin
   leaves (mosses) are replaced by evergreen, rosette forms (isoetids),
   which are replaced by non-evergreen charophytes and broadleaf vascular
   plants, especially pondweeds, in addition to an increasing fraction of
   plants with generative reproduction. A strong relationship was found
   between plant traits (leaves and shoots) and environmental factors (pH
   and calcium content). The regulator of diversity in macrophyte
   communities is the calcium concentration in water. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Booktitle = {{AUSTRAL ARK: THE STATE OF WILDLIFE IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND}},
Year = {{2015}},
Pages = {{259-277}},
Abstract = {{Australia is a repository of a unique flora once widespread throughout
   Gondwana, the southern supercontinent. As the connectivity to other
   landmasses was lost, an indigenous Australian flora evolved in response
   to changing environmental conditions from prevalently wet to prevalently
   dry. Although the Tertiary fossil record suggests the continent-wide
   dominance of rainforest communities, it also documents an adaptive trend
   towards cooler, drier and more seasonal climates. More recently, the
   Quaternary saw a succession of glacial cycles that produced transitional
   plant communities that were considerably different from current ones. On
   the whole, major natural disturbances and long-term landscape
   modifications have steadily contributed to Australia's floristic
   diversity.
   However, the arrival of people has introduced increasing and more rapid
   pressure on natural habitats through intensive land usage and
   degradation, as well as the introduction of pests and weeds resulting in
   a new set of threats to biodiversity. Protecting and conserving species
   as well as the condition of natural ecosystems is becoming an
   increasingly pressing concern that requires an integrated approach.
   Describing the extent and distribution of diversity and endemism is
   important, but should represent only a preliminary step towards the
   development of conservation criteria. Biodiversity management is
   increasingly reliant on our understanding of the relative vulnerability
   of species and communities to current, past and future threats. As we
   better understand how species and assemblages respond to temporal
   changes in environmental disturbance, it will become increasingly
   possible to explore proactive conservation and restoration strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The vegetation indices normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and
   photochemical reflectance index (PRI) provide indicators of pigmentation
   and photosynthetic activity that can be used to model photosynthesis
   from remote sensing with the light-use-efficiency model. To help develop
   and validate this approach, reliable proximal NDVI and PRI sensors have
   been needed. We tested new NDVI and PRI sensors, ``spectral reflectance
   sensors{''} (SRS sensors; recently developed by Decagon Devices, during
   spring activation of photosynthetic activity in evergreen and deciduous
   stands. We also evaluated two methods of sensor cross-calibration - one
   that considered sky conditions (cloud cover) at midday only, and another
   that also considered diurnal sun angle effects. Cross-calibration
   clearly affected sensor agreement with independent measurements, with
   the best method dependent upon the study aim and time frame (seasonal
   vs. diurnal). The seasonal patterns of NDVI and PRI differed for
   evergreen and deciduous species, demonstrating the complementary nature
   of these two indices. Over the spring season, PRI was most strongly
   influenced by changing chlorophyll : carotenoid pool sizes, while over
   the diurnal timescale, PRI was most affected by the xanthophyll cycle
   epoxidation state. This finding demonstrates that the SRS PRI sensors
   can resolve different processes affecting PRI over different timescales.
   The advent of small, inexpensive, automated PRI and NDVI sensors offers
   new ways to explore environmental and physiological constraints on
   photosynthesis, and may be particularly well suited for use at flux
   tower sites. Wider application of automated sensors could lead to
   improved integration of flux and remote sensing approaches for studying
   photosynthetic carbon uptake, and could help define the concept of
   contrasting vegetation optical types.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The concept of resilience continues to crescendo since the 1990s,
   touching on multiple fields with multiple interpretations and uses.
   Here, we start from its origins in systems ecology, framing the
   resilience concept explicitly in the adaptive cycle with the observation
   that resilient systems are ones that successfully navigate all stages of
   growth, development, collapse, and reorientation of this cycle. The
   model is explored in terms of the traps and pathologies that hinder this
   successful navigation, particularly when applied to socioeconomic
   organizations and decision-management situations. For example, for
   continuous function over the adaptive life cycle, a system needs
   activation energy or resources to grow, followed by adequate structure
   and complexity to maintain maturity. Implementation of crisis plans may
   avert collapse, but during catastrophe, the ability to improvise and
   re-orient will allow the system to emerge along a new cycle. We review
   the capacities, competencies, and cultures needed by these
   organizations, specifically, identifying that the needed resources are
   often cultivated in earlier stages, thus requiring consideration of the
   entire life cycle for success.}},

   adaptation strategies, and barriers to implementation}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Recent mandates in the United States require federal agencies to
   incorporate climate change science into land management planning
   efforts. These mandates target possible adaptation and mitigation
   strategies. However, the degree to which climate change is actively
   being considered in agency planning and management decisions is largely
   unknown. We explored the usefulness of climate change science for
   federal resource managers, focusing on the efficacy of potential
   adaptation strategies and barriers limiting the use of climate change
   science in adaptation efforts. Our study was conducted in the northern
   Rocky Mountains region of the western United States, where we interacted
   with 77 U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management personnel
   through surveys, semistructured interviews, and four collaborative
   workshops at locations across Idaho and Montana. We used a mixed-methods
   approach to evaluate managers' perceptions about adapting to and
   mitigating for climate change. Although resource managers incorporate
   general language about climate change in regional and landscape-level
   planning documents, they are currently not planning on-the-ground
   adaptation or mitigation projects. However, managers felt that their
   organizations were most likely to adapt to climate change through use of
   existing management strategies that are already widely implemented for
   other non climate-related management goals. These existing strategies,
   (e.g., thinning and prescribed burning) are perceived as more feasible
   than new climate-specific methods (e.g., assisted migration) because
   they already have public and agency support, accomplish multiple goals,
   and require less anticipation of the future timing and probability of
   climate change impacts. Participants reported that the most common
   barriers to using climate change information included a lack of
   management-relevant climate change science, inconsistent agency
   guidance, and insufficient time and resources to access, interpret, and
   apply current climate science information to management plans.}},

Title = {{Developmental stages of cultivated strawberry flowers in relation to
   chilling sensitivity}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Abstract = {{Environmental factors affecting flower development may limit the yields
   of fruiting crops worldwide. In temperate regions, chilling temperatures
   during flower development can compromise fruit production, but their
   negative effects vary depending on the differing susceptibilities of
   each developmental stage. The cultivated strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa
   Duch.) is widely grown worldwide but financial returns are influenced by
   sudden shifts to chilling temperatures occurring during the cropping
   cycle. Despite this important limitation, knowledge of F. x ananassa
   flower development is lacking, in contrast to the diploid wild-type
   strawberry (F. vesca). In this study we describe steps in floral
   development of cultivated strawberry and define their vulnerability to
   chilling temperatures. To achieve this, flower buds from strawberry
   plants of cv. `Camarosa' were labelled and monitored from bud initiation
   until anthesis. Description of morphological and functional changes
   during flower developmentwas based on histological sections and scanning
   electron microscopy. To determine the impact of low temperatures at
   different developmental stages, plants carrying buds of different sizes
   were chilled at 2 degrees C for 24 h. Several parameters related to male
   and female gametophyte development were later evaluated in flowers as
   they approached anthesis. Fragaria x ananassa flower development was
   divided into 16 stages according to landmark events. These stages were
   similar to those documented for F. vesca but three new additional
   intermediate stages were described. Timing of developmental processes
   was achieved by correlating developmental staging with specific bud
   sizes and days before anthesis. Time to reach anthesis from early bud
   stages was 17-18 days. During this period, we detected four critical
   periods vulnerable to low temperatures. These were mostly related to
   male gametophyte development but also to injury to female organs at late
   developmental stages. These results provide the essential groundwork on
   floral biology of cultivated strawberry that is a prerequisite for
   successful comparative studies of cold tolerance among genotypes during
   flower formation.}},

   Siberia}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2227-2245}},
Abstract = {{The organic-carbon (OC) pool accumulated in Arctic permafrost
   (perennially frozen ground) equals the carbon stored in the modern
   atmosphere. To give an idea of how Yedoma region permafrost could
   respond under future climatic warming, we conducted a study to quantify
   the organic-matter quality (here defined as the intrinsic potential to
   be further transformed, decomposed, and mineralized) of late Pleistocene
   (Yedoma) and Holocene (thermokarst) deposits on the Buor-Khaya
   Peninsula, northeast Siberia. The objective of this study was to develop
   a stratigraphic classified organic-matter quality characterization. For
   this purpose the degree of organic-matter decomposition was estimated by
   using a multiproxy approach. We applied sedimentological (grain-size
   analyses, bulk density, ice content) and geochemical parameters (total
   OC, stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13),total organic carbon : nitrogen
   (C / N) ratios) as well as lipid biomarkers (n-alkanes, n-fatty acids,
   hopanes, triterpenoids, and biomarker indices, i.e., average chain
   length, carbon preference index (CPI), and higher-plant fatty-acid index
   (HPFA)). Our results show that the Yedoma and thermokarst organic-matter
   qualities for further decomposition exhibit no obvious degradation-depth
   trend. Relatively, the C / N and delta C-13 values and the HPFA index
   show a significantly better preservation of the organic matter stored in
   thermokarst deposits compared to Yedoma deposits. The CPI data suggest
   less degradation of the organic matter from both deposits, with a higher
   value for Yedoma organic matter. As the interquartile ranges of the
   proxies mostly over-lap, we interpret this as indicating comparable
   quality for further decomposition for both kinds of deposits with likely
   better thermokarst organic-matter quality. Supported by principal
   component analyses, the sediment parameters and quality proxies of
   Yedoma and thermokarst deposits could not be unambiguously separated
   from each other. This revealed that the organic-matter vulnerability is
   heterogeneous and depends on different decomposition trajectories and
   the previous decomposition and preservation history. Elucidating this
   was one of the major new contributions of our multiproxy study. With the
   addition of biomarker data, it was possible to show that permafrost
   organic-matter degradation likely occurs via a combination of
   (uncompleted) degradation cycles or a cascade of degradation steps
   rather than as a linear function of age or sediment facies. We conclude
   that the amount of organic matter in the studied sediments is high for
   mineral soils and of good quality and therefore susceptible to future
   decomposition. The lack of depth trends shows that permafrost acts like
   a giant freezer, preserving the constant quality of ancient organic
   matter. When undecomposed Yedoma organic matter is mobilized via
   thermokarst processes, the fate of this carbon depends largely on the
   environmental conditions; the carbon could be preserved in an
   undecomposed state till refreezing occurs. If modern input has occurred,
   thermokarst organic matter could be of a better quality for future
   microbial decomposition than that found in Yedoma deposits.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Current and future human and forest landscape conditions are influenced
   by the cumulative, unfolding history of social-ecological interactions.
   Examining past system responses, especially unintended consequences, can
   reveal valuable insights that promote learning and adaptation in forest
   policy and management. Temporal couplings are complex, however; they can
   be difficult to trace, characterize, and explain. We develop a framework
   that integrates environmental history into analysis of coupled human and
   natural systems (CHANS). Our study demonstrates how historical data and
   methods can help to explain temporal complexity of long-term CHANS
   feedbacks. We focus on two sources of temporal complexity: legacy
   effects and lagged interactions. We apply our framework to a
   multiple-ownership forest landscape comprising tribal and nonindustrial
   private forest ownerships in Wisconsin. Our framework features four
   elements that help investigators better understand complex systems
   through time: (1) a temporal axis parsed into historical periods
   (periodization), (2) representation of links between historical periods
   and system feedbacks, (3) representation of land ownership history, and
   (4) nested geographical scales of historical analysis. The framework can
   help to reveal legacy effects and lagged interactions, illuminate
   turning points and periods in system dynamics, and distil insights from
   unintended consequences that inform institutional and policy adaptation.
   We also assess the validity of using land ownership to represent the
   social component of CHANS models. When treated as a categorical variable
   and interpreted in historical context, land ownership can validly
   represent decision-making structure, culture, and knowledge system in
   spatially explicit social-ecological models.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation degradation causes reduction in the available biomass, and

   test hazard assessment of this type of degradation. The different kinds
   of data for indicators of vegetation degradation were gathered from
   collecting of field data like percent canopy and biomass and also
   records and published reports of the governmental offices of Iran. A new
   model has been developed for assessing the hazard of vegetation
   degradation using DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, State, Impacts and
   Responses) framework. The approach is based on the use of indicators,
   which may be direct or indirect, ecological, technical, socioeconomic or
   cultural causes of environmental hazard. Taking into consideration
   fourteen indicators of vegetation degradation the model identifies areas
   with different hazard class. The preparation of hazard maps based on the
   Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis of these indicators will be
   helpful for prioritizing the areas to initiate remedial measures. By
   fixing the thresholds of severity classes of the fourteen indicators, a
   hazard map for each indicator was first prepared in GIS. The hazard
   classes were defined on the basis of hazard scores arrived at by
   assigning the appropriate attributes to the indicators and the final
   hazard map was prepared by intersecting fourteen hazard maps in five
   main hazard layers including anthropogenic, natural, current state of
   hazard, livestock pressure and trend of degradation in the GIS. Results
   show among the five main hazard maps used in the model, the most main
   effective indicator in vegetation degradation of the study area is
   `Current State of Hazard'. Also areas under severe hazard class have
   been found to be widespread (58\%) and areas under moderate hazard class
   have been found (42\%) in the Sadra watershed.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, environmental conservation directives are mandating greater
   inclusion of Indigenous people and their knowledge in the management of
   global ecosystems. Colonised countries such as the United States of
   America, New Zealand and Australia have responded with an array of
   policy and programs to enhance Indigenous involvement; however,
   balancing Indigenous and non-Indigenous priorities and preferred
   management methods is a substantial challenge. Using Australia as a case
   study, we investigate past documentation and use of Indigenous
   biocultural knowledge (IBK) and assess the main contributions to
   ecosystem science and management. Focussing on the terrestrial
   environment, this innovative paper presents an integrated review of IBK
   documentation (IBKD) by conducting a spatial, temporal and content
   analysis of the publically available literature. A spatial analysis of
   the place-based documents identified Australian IBKD hotspots, gaps and
   opportunities for further collaboration. Sixty percent of IBKM has
   occurred off the Indigenous estate with only 19\% of the total
   coinciding with current Indigenous Protected Areas. We also found that
   IBKD hotspots were different to Australia's biodiversity hotspots
   suggesting opportunity for development of integrated biological and
   cultural hotspots. A temporal analysis of IBKD showed exponential growth
   since the 1970s and typical involvement of non-Indigenous researchers.
   Indigenous authorship remained negligible until the 1990s when there was
   an obvious increase, although only 14\% of IBKD to date has acknowledged
   Indigenous authorship. Working through Australia's broad biological
   conservation priorities, we demonstrate how IBK has and can be used to
   inform research and management of biodiversity, threatened species,
   aquatic ecosystems, fire, invasive species, and climate change. We also
   synthesise documented suggestions for overcoming cross-cultural
   awareness and communication challenges between Indigenous people and
   biologists, environmental managers and policy makers. Lastly, we suggest
   that inclusion of both tangible and philosophical engagement of
   Indigenous people in national conservation agendas may promote more
   holistic socio-ecological systems thinking and facilitate greater
   progress towards addressing the Indigenous engagement directive of

Title = {{Land use at the reach scale as a major determinant for benthic
   invertebrate community in Mediterranean rivers of Cyprus}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{The European Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/CE) requires the
   quantification of anthropogenic pressures for evaluating the risk of
   failing environmental objectives when setting river basin management
   plans and for biological data interpretation when assessing ecological
   status. Many studies emphasized the close relationship between
   biological communities (e.g., fishes and invertebrates) and land use.
   The need for evaluating the impact of non-natural land use at different
   spatial scales is often stated, and relatively small spatial scales can
   be particularly relevant to understand biotic community changes. Abiotic
   descriptors derived for the reach scale can thus be used to evaluate the
   success of restoration measures, and their selection and testing is
   urgent for river management purposes. In this context we describe a new
   index, which allows quantification of land use modification at the reach
   scale, the `Land Use Index - reach' (LUIr). The LUIr was developed on
   the basis of data gathered in the field with the CARAVAGGIO method
   (river habitat survey technique). A full description of the index is
   presented. In addition, jointly with a series of environmental
   descriptors developed for the quantification of general or specific
   anthropogenic stressors (sensu WFD), the effectiveness of the new index
   (LUIr) in describing environmental gradients as perceived from benthic
   invertebrates has been evaluated for Mediterranean rivers in Cyprus. The
   multiple regression analysis performed (all subset regression and
   relative importance) revealed that among the set of environmental
   descriptors the LUIr resulted to be the factor best explaining the
   variation of biological metrics. Additionally, the analysis highlighted
   that the biological metrics more influenced by land use at the catchment
   level (LUIc) are those estimating the overall diversity and are
   consequently more influenced by factors at larger scale. The descriptor
   derived by physico-chemical parameters was in a few cases selected by
   regression analysis as the most important factor in explaining variation
   of biological metrics. The descriptors able to detect variation of other
   habitat features (i.e., habitat modification, habitat diversity and
   lentic-lotic character) resulted as weak predictors in the models. Our
   results support the conclusion that the LUIr index can be a useful and
   cost-effective tool to interpret invertebrate community variation.
   Moreover, as urgently requested by WFD, LUIr can be used to set and
   check effectiveness of measures for the improvement of aquatic
   ecosystems, particularly for Mediterranean streams where agricultural
   land use is one of the main anthropogenic pressures. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{A set of sustainability performance indicators for seafood: Direct human
   consumption products from Peruvian anchoveta fisheries and freshwater
   aquaculture}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{518-532}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Different seafood products based on Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis
   ringens) fisheries and freshwater aquaculture of trout (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss), tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) and black pacu (Colossoma
   macropomum), contribute at different scales to the socio-economic
   development, environmental degradation and nutrition of the Peruvian
   population. Various indicators have been used in the literature to
   assess the performance of these industries regarding different aspects
   of sustainability, notably their socio-economic performance. In this
   study, a novel set of indicators is proposed to evaluate the
   sustainability performance of these industries in Peru, based on life
   cycle assessment (LCA) and nutritional profiling, as well as on energy
   and socio-economic assessment approaches. The emphasis is put on the
   potential of different products to contribute to improving the nutrition
   of the Peruvian population in an energy-efficient, environmentally
   friendly and socio-economically sound way. The set of indicators
   includes biotic resource use (BRU), cumulative energy demand (CED),
   energy return on investment (EROI), production costs, gross profit
   generation, added value, and nutritional profile in terms of vitamins,
   minerals and essential fatty acids; as well as a number of life cycle
   impact assessment indicators commonly used in seafood studies, and some
   recently proposed indicators of resource status (measuring the impacts
   of fish biomass removal at the species and ecosystem levels). Results
   suggest that more energy-intensive/highly processed products (cured and
   canned anchoveta products) represent a higher burden, in terms of
   environmental impact, than less energy-intensive products (salted and
   frozen anchoveta products, semi-intensive aquaculture products). This
   result is confirmed when comparing all products regarding their
   industrial-to-nutritional energy ratio. Regarding the other attributes
   analysed, the scoring shows that salted and frozen anchoveta products
   generate fewer jobs and lower gross profit than canned and cured, while
   aquaculture products maximise them. Overall, it was concluded that less
   energy-intensive industries (anchoveta freezing and salting) are the
   least environmentally impacting but also the least economically
   interesting products, yet delivering higher nutritional value.
   Aquaculture products maximise gross profit and job creation, with lower
   energy efficiency and nutritional values. The proposed set of
   sustainability indicators fulfilled its goal in providing a
   multi-criteria assessment of anchoveta direct human consumption and
   freshwater aquaculture products. As often the case, there is no ideal
   product and the best trade-off must be sought when making decision
   regarding fisheries and seafood policy. No threshold for performance of
   the different indicators is offered, because the goal of the comparison
   is to contrast the relative performance among products, not of products
   against reference values. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In northern forests, large amounts of missing N that dominate N balances
   at scales ranging from small watersheds to large regional drainage
   basins may be related to N-gas production by soil microbes. We measured
   denitrification rates in forest soils in northeastern North America
   along a N deposition gradient to determine whether N-gas fluxes were a
   significant fate for atmospheric N inputs and whether denitrification
   rates were correlated with N availability, soil O-2 status, or forest
   type. We quantified N-2 and N2O fluxes in the laboratory with an
   intact-core method and monitored soil O-2, temperature and moisture in
   three forests differing in natural and anthropogenic N enrichment:
   Turkey Lakes Watershed, Ontario; Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New
   Hampshire; and Bear Brook Watershed, Maine (fertilized and reference
   plots in hardwood and softwood stands). Total N-gas flux estimates
   ranged from < 1 in fertilized hardwood uplands at Bear Brook to > 100 kg
   N ha(-1) year(-1) in hardwood wetlands at Turkey Lakes. N-gas flux
   increased systematically with natural N enrichment from soils with high
   nitrification rates (Bear Brook < Hubbard Brook < Turkey Lakes) but did
   not increase in the site where N fertilizer has been added since 1989
   (Bear Brook). Our results show that denitrification is an important and
   underestimated term (1-24 \% of atmospheric N inputs) in N budgets of
   upland forests in northeastern North America, but it does not appear to
   be an important sink for elevated anthropogenic atmospheric N deposition
   in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Many ecological phenomena combine to direct vegetation trends over time,
   with climate and disturbance playing prominent roles. To help decipher
   their relative importance during Euro-American times, we employed a
   unique approach whereby tree species/genera were partitioned into
   temperature, shade tolerance, and pyrogenicity classes and applied to
   comparative tree-census data. Our megadata analysis of 190 datasets
   determined the relative impacts of climate vs. altered disturbance
   regimes for various biomes across the eastern United States. As the
   Euro-American period (ca. 1500 to today) spans two major climatic
   periods, from Little Ice Age to the Anthropocene, vegetation changes
   consistent with warming were expected. In most cases, however, European
   disturbance overrode regional climate, but in a manner that varied
   across the Tension Zone Line. To the north, intensive and expansive
   early European disturbance resulted in the ubiquitous loss of conifers
   and large increases of Acer, Populus, and Quercus in northern hardwoods,
   whereas to the south, these disturbances perpetuated the dominance of
   Quercus in central hardwoods. Acer increases and associated
   mesophication in Quercus-Pinus systems were delayed until mid 20th
   century fire suppression. This led to significant warm to cool shifts in
   temperature class where cool-adapted Acer saccharum increased and
   temperature neutral changes where warm-adapted Acer rubrum increased. In
   both cases, these shifts were attributed to fire suppression rather than
   climate change. Because mesophication is ongoing, eastern US forests
   formed during the catastrophic disturbance era followed by fire
   suppression will remain in climate disequilibrium into the foreseeable
   future. Overall, the results of our study suggest that altered
   disturbance regimes rather than climate had the greatest influence on
   vegetation composition and dynamics in the eastern United States over
   multiple centuries. Land-use change often trumped or negated the impacts
   of warming climate, and needs greater recognition in climate change
   discussions, scenarios, and model interpretations.}},

Title = {{Influence of physiological phenology on the seasonal pattern of
   ecosystem respiration in deciduous forests}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{363-376}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the environmental and biotic drivers of respiration at the
   ecosystem level is a prerequisite to further improve scenarios of the
   global carbon cycle. In this study we investigated the relevance of
   physiological phenology, defined as seasonal changes in plant
   physiological properties, for explaining the temporal dynamics of
   ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) in deciduous forests. Previous studies
   showed that empirical R-ECO models can be substantially improved by
   considering the biotic dependency of R-ECO on the short-term
   productivity (e.g., daily gross primary production, GPP) in addition to
   the well-known environmental controls of temperature and water
   availability. Here, we use a model-data integration approach to
   investigate the added value of physiological phenology, represented by
   the first temporal derivative of GPP, or alternatively of the fraction
   of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, for modeling R-ECO at
   19 deciduous broadleaved forests in the FLUXNET La Thuile database. The
   new data-oriented semiempirical model leads to an 8\% decrease in root
   mean square error (RMSE) and a 6\% increase in the modeling efficiency
   (EF) of modeled R-ECO when compared to a version of the model that does
   not consider the physiological phenology. The reduction of the
   model-observation bias occurred mainly at the monthly time scale, and in
   spring and summer, while a smaller reduction was observed at the annual
   time scale. The proposed approach did not improve the model performance
   at several sites, and we identified as potential causes the plant canopy
   heterogeneity and the use of air temperature as a driver of ecosystem
   respiration instead of soil temperature. However, in the majority of
   sites the model-error remained unchanged regardless of the driving
   temperature. Overall, our results point toward the potential for
   improving current approaches for modeling R-ECO in deciduous forests by
   including the phenological cycle of the canopy.}},

Abstract = {{Marine planktonic copepods are an ecologically important group with high
   species richness and abundance. Here, we propose a new metagenetic
   approach for revealing the community structure of marine planktonic
   copepods using 454 pyrosequencing of nuclear large subunit ribosomal
   DNA. We determined an appropriate similarity threshold for clustering
   pyrosequencing data into molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs)
   using an artificial community containing 33 morphologically identified
   species. The 99\% similarity threshold had high species-level resolution
   for MOTU clustering but overestimated species richness. The artificial
   community was appropriately clustered into MOTUs at 97\% similarity,
   with little inflation in MOTU numbers and with relatively high
   species-level resolution. The number of sequence reads of each MOTU was
   correlated with dry weight of that taxon, suggesting that sequence reads
   could be used as a proxy for biomass. Next, we applied the method to
   field-collected samples, and the results corresponded reasonably well
   with morphological analysis of these communities. Numbers of MOTUs were
   well correlated with species richness at 97\% similarity, and large
   numbers of sequence reads were generally observed in MOTUs derived from
   species with large biomass. Further, MOTUs were successfully classified
   into taxonomic groups at the family level at 97\% similarity; similar
   patterns of species richness and biomass were revealed within families
   with metagenetic and morphological analyses. At the 99\% similarity
   threshold, MOTUs with high proportions of sequence reads were identified
   as biomass-dominant species in each field-collected sample. The
   metagenetic approach reported here can be an effective tool for rapid
   and comprehensive assessment of copepod community structure.}},

   mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) was used as DNA barcode
   to identify the Murinae and Arvicolinae species distributed in China and

   There was no obvious barcode gap. The average K2P distance within
   species and genera was 2.10\% and 12.61\% in Murinae, and 2.86\% and
   11.80\% in Arvicolinae, respectively. The optimal threshold was 5.62\%

Pages = {{3-9}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Baselines rooted in historical records or concepts of previous
   conditions are necessarily used to identify and generate recovery goals
   for endangered species. However, strict adherence to various spatial,
   temporal, and genetic baselines can limit endangered species recovery
   actions, success, and the broader conservation of biodiversity. Recent
   approaches that deviate from historical baselines such as assisted
   colonization and intentional hybridization have been used to facilitate
   recovery but lack broad acceptance and an underpinning conceptual
   framework to guide their use in practice. We here present a novel
   framework for addressing when baseline-abandoning approaches should be
   implemented that requires both scientific input and management-defined
   thresholds. We submit that in cases where species face extreme
   endangerment and managers have little chance of reducing or ameliorating
   future threats within a species' historical range, it is better to
   embrace a more flexible recovery model that includes taking action that
   deviates from historical baselines. Embracing this reinterpretation of
   management baselines not only has the potential to advance endangered
   species recovery but could have important cascading effects on
   ecosystem-based approaches to conservation. Further, rethinking
   adherences to baselines can affect our broader social-psychological
   relationship with wildlife conservation and management. Overall,
   although historical data on baseline conditions will remain vital to the
   initial setting of recovery goals, many situations will require more
   dynamic interpretations of paths to recovering endangered species. (c)

Abstract = {{The desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) is one of the few
   ungulates native to North America capable of surviving in harsh desert
   environments and xeric conditions. However, the effects of an
   increasingly arid climate on this species and its habitat are unknown.
   We sought to identify important predictors of desert bighorn sheep
   diurnal space use to provide new insight into management and
   conservation opportunities. We evaluated home range size and relative
   intensity of space use for 41 collared individuals monitored between
   2007 and 2010 across a 14,217-km(2) extent of Arizona's Sonoran Desert,
   including the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge and the United States Army
   Yuma Proving Ground. Using linear mixed models and an
   information-theoretic approach, we developed seasonal models of
   intensity of space use for the summer (Jun-Aug) and non-summer (Sep-May)
   seasons. Models included environmental variables representing escape
   terrain and distance from developed waters, and Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index metrics that represented forage and preformed water
   resources. We found intensity of space use to be greater for females
   (than for males) in the summer season and smaller home range sizes for
   both sexes in the summer season. Escape terrain was the dominant
   predictor of intensity of space use in both seasons, but forage and
   preformed water resources were strong predictors only in the non-summer
   season. These results likely reflected a seasonal trade-off between
   escape terrain (i.e., predator avoidance) and limited forage and water
   resources, particularly for more risk-averse females. Effective
   conservation and management strategies for desert bighorn sheep should
   consider the availability of both quality forage and water resources in
   areas of escape terrain. Although more research is needed on
   species-specific vulnerabilities to climate change and drought, our
   approach to integrating vegetation indices into estimates of space use
   is highly transferable to analyses of other wide-ranging species
   occupying dynamic arid environments. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Local adaptation is a central feature of most species occupying
   spatially heterogeneous environments, and may factor critically in
   responses to environmental change. However, most efforts to model the
   response of species to climate change ignore intraspecific variation due
   to local adaptation. Here, we present a new perspective on spatial
   modelling of organism-environment relationships that combines genomic
   data and community-level modelling to develop scenarios regarding the
   geographic distribution of genomic variation in response to
   environmental change. Rather than modelling species within communities,
   we use these techniques to model large numbers of loci across genomes.
   Using balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) as a case study, we
   demonstrate how our framework can accommodate nonlinear responses of
   loci to environmental gradients. We identify a threshold response to
   temperature in the circadian clock gene GIGANTEA-5 (GI5), suggesting
   that this gene has experienced strong local adaptation to temperature.
   We also demonstrate how these methods can map ecological adaptation from
   genomic data, including the identification of predicted differences in
   the genetic composition of populations under current and future
   climates. Community-level modelling of genomic variation represents an
   important advance in landscape genomics and spatial modelling of
   biodiversity that moves beyond species-level assessments of climate

Abstract = {{Ecohydrology provides a framework for aquatic ecosystem management based
   on the interplay between different biota and hydrology. Bangladesh being
   situated in the world's largest delta is suffering from rapid
   degradation of its aquatic ecosystems. The ever increasing population
   pressure and intensive agriculture together with diversion of upstream
   water flows by India and climate induced changes make this ecosystem
   even more vulnerable. Using information from diverse sources, this paper
   explores the current state of the art on aquatic ecosystems of
   Bangladesh, their management, key problems, and introduces a new
   ecohydrology-based management approach for sustainable management of
   aquatic ecosystems in the country. Integration of both physical measures
   and policy actions are indispensable for greater ecosystem service
   provision from country's aquatic ecosystems. A cross-disciplinary action
   plan and appropriate strategies to bring policies into action is also
   essential for the sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems in the

Title = {{A novel approach to quantifying the spatiotemporal behavior of
   instrumented grey seals used to sample the environment}},
Journal = {{MOVEMENT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Paired with satellite location telemetry, animal-borne
   instruments can collect spatiotemporal data describing the animal's
   movement and environment at a scale relevant to its behavior. Ecologists
   have developed methods for identifying the area(s) used by an animal
   (e.g., home range) and those used most intensely (utilization
   distribution) based on location data. However, few have extended these
   models beyond their traditional roles as descriptive 2D summaries of
   point data. Here we demonstrate how the home range method, T-LoCoH, can
   be expanded to quantify collective sampling coverage by multiple
   instrumented animals using grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) equipped with
   GPS tags and acoustic transceivers on the Scotian Shelf (Atlantic
   Canada) as a case study. At the individual level, we illustrate how time
   and space-use metrics quantifying individual sampling coverage may be
   used to determine the rate of acoustic transmissions received.
   Results: Grey seals collectively sampled an area of 11,308 km(2) and
   intensely sampled an area of 31 km(2) from June-December. The largest
   area sampled was in July (2094.56 km(2)) and the smallest area sampled
   occurred in August (1259.80 km(2)), with changes in sampling coverage
   observed through time.
   Conclusions: T-LoCoH provides an effective means to quantify changes in
   collective sampling effort by multiple instrumented animals and to
   compare these changes across time. We also illustrate how time and
   space-use metrics of individual instrumented seal movement calculated
   using T-LoCoH can be used to account for differences in the amount of
   time a bioprobe (biological sampling platform) spends in an area.}},

Title = {{Foraging ecology of three sympatric ungulate species - Behavioural and
   resource maps indicate differences between chamois, ibex and red deer}},
Journal = {{MOVEMENT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Background: The spatial distribution of forage resources is a major
   driver of animal movement patterns. Understanding where animals forage
   is important for the conservation of multi-species communities, since
   interspecific competition can emerge if different species use the same
   depletable resources. However, determining forage resources in a
   spatially continuous fashion in alpine grasslands at high spatial
   resolution was challenging up to now, because terrain heterogeneity
   causes vegetation characteristics to vary at small spatial scales, and
   methods for detection of behavioural phases in animal movement patterns
   were not widely available. We delineated areas coupled to the foraging
   behaviour of three sympatric ungulate species (chamois, ibex, red deer)
   using Time Local Convex Hull (T-LoCoH), a non-parametric utilisation
   distribution method incorporating spatial and temporal autocorrelation
   structure of GPS data. We used resource maps of plant biomass and plant
   nitrogen content derived from high-resolution airborne imaging
   spectroscopy data, and multinomial logistic regression to compare the
   foraging areas of the three ungulate species.
   Results: We found significant differences in plant biomass and plant
   nitrogen content between the core foraging areas of chamois, ibex and
   red deer. Core foraging areas of chamois were characterised by low plant
   biomass and low to medium plant nitrogen content. Core foraging areas of
   ibex were, in contrast, characterised by high plant nitrogen content,
   but varied in plant biomass, and core foraging areas of red deer had
   high plant biomass, but varied in plant nitrogen content.
   Conclusions: Previous studies carried out in the same study area found
   no difference in forage consumed by chamois, ibex and red deer.
   Methodologically, those studies were based on micro-histological
   analysis of plant fragments identifying them to plant family or
   functional type level. However, vegetation properties such as
   productivity (biomass) or plant nutrient content can vary within
   vegetation communities, especially in highly heterogeneous landscapes.
   Thus, the combination of high spatial resolution resource maps with a
   utilisation distribution method allowing to generate behavioural maps
   (T-LoCoH) provides new insights into the foraging ecology of the three
   sympatric species, important for their conservation and to monitor
   expected future changes.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionNiche differentiation results in functionally diverse
   communities that are often composed of dominant species with contrasting
   trait values. However, many predictive trait-based models that emphasize
   environmental filtering have implicitly assumed that traits exhibit
   unimodal distributions among individuals within communities centred on
   an optimal trait value. Does accounting for more complex, multimodal
   trait distributions among individuals in a community improve predictions
   of species abundances and functional diversity along environmental
   gradients?
   LocationFranz Josef soil chronosequence, central Westland, New Zealand.
   MethodsLeaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations from 23 woody
   plant species were modelled as functions of soil total N and P from
   eight sites of declining soil P. We compared predictions to observations
   of species abundances and functional diversity along the soil
   chronosequence using two modelling approaches: (i) the standard
   application of the hierarchical Bayesian Traitspace model that assumes
   unimodally distributed traits at each point along the gradient, and (ii)
   a modified application of the model that accounts for multimodal trait
   distributions within each community.
   ResultsSoil P was the strongest predictor of traits and species
   abundances. The strength of the environmental filter of leaf traits
   changed along this gradient, as evidenced by highly constrained
   variances and low modality of the trait distribution at low soil P, and
   high variance and multimodality at high soil P. Both modelling
   approaches predicted species abundances that were significantly
   correlated with observations, but the multimodal approach significantly
   improved predictions of species abundances and functional diversity.
   ConclusionsOur results indicate that predictive models that emphasize
   environmental filtering over niche differentiation by assuming unimodal
   trait distributions can be more parsimonious than more complex
   approaches, especially when predicting species abundances along strong
   environmental gradients. However, models need to account for trait
   multimodality if they are to accurately replicate spatial patterns in
   functional diversity. This is important since functional diversity may
   be a key predictor of ecosystem function and resilience to global
   change.}},

Abstract = {{While the impacts of heat upon mortality and morbidity have been
   frequently studied, few studies have examined the relationship between
   heat, morbidity, and mortality across the same events. This research
   assesses the relationship between heat events and morbidity and
   mortality in New York City for the period 1991-2004. Heat events are
   defined based on oppressive weather types as determined by the Spatial
   Synoptic Classification. Morbidity data include hospitalizations for
   heat-related, respiratory, and cardiovascular causes; mortality data
   include these subsets as well as all-cause totals. Distributed-lag
   models assess the relationship between heat and health outcome for a
   cumulative 15-day period following exposure. To further refine analysis,
   subset analyses assess the differences between early- and late-season
   events, shorter and longer events, and earlier and later years. The
   strongest heat-health relationships occur with all-cause mortality,
   cardiovascular mortality, and heat-related hospital admissions. The
   impacts of heat are greater during longer heat events and during the
   middle of summer, when increased mortality is still statistically
   significant after accounting for mortality displacement. Early-season
   heat waves have increases in mortality that appear to be largely
   short-term displacement. The impacts of heat on mortality have decreased
   over time. Heat-related hospital admissions have increased during this
   time, especially during the earlier days of heat events. Given the
   trends observed, it suggests that a greater awareness of heat hazards
   may have led to increased short-term hospitalizations with a
   commensurate decrease in mortality.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{127-141}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Reliable estimates of past land cover are critical for assessing
   potential effects of anthropogenic land-cover changes on past earth
   surface-climate feedbacks and landscape complexity. Fossil pollen
   records from lakes and bogs have provided important information on past
   natural and human-induced vegetation cover. However, those records
   provide only point estimates of past land cover, and not the spatially
   continuous maps at regional and sub-continental scales needed for
   climate modelling.
   We propose a set of statistical models that create spatially continuous
   maps of past land cover by combining two data sets: 1) pollen-based
   point estimates of past land cover (from the REVEALS model) and 2)
   spatially continuous estimates of past land cover, obtained by combining
   simulated potential vegetation (from LPJ-GUESS) with an anthropogenic
   land-cover change scenario (KK10). The proposed models rely on
   statistical methodology for compositional data and use Gaussian Markov
   Random Fields to model spatial dependencies in the data.
   Land-cover reconstructions are presented for three time windows in
   Europe: 0.05, 0.2, and 6 ka years before present (BP). The models are
   evaluated through cross-validation, deviance information criteria and by
   comparing the reconstruction of the 0.05 ka time window to the
   present-day land-cover data compiled by the European Forest Institute
   (EFI). For 0.05 ka, the proposed models provide reconstructions that are
   closer to the EFI data than either the REVEALS- or LPJ-GUESS/KK10-based
   estimates; thus the statistical combination of the two estimates
   improves the reconstruction. The reconstruction by the proposed models
   for 0.2 ka is also good. For 6 ka, however, the large differences
   between the REVEALS- and LPJ-GUESS/KK10-based estimates reduce the
   reliability of the proposed models. Possible reasons for the increased
   differences between REVEALS and LPJ-GUESS/KK10 for older time periods
   and further improvement of the proposed models are discussed. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Understanding the behavioral decisions behind animal movement and space
   use patterns is a key challenge for behavioral ecology. Tools to
   quantify these patterns from movement and animal-habitat interactions
   are vital for transforming ecology into a predictive science. This is
   particularly important in environments undergoing rapid anthropogenic
   changes, such as the Amazon rainforest, where animals face novel
   landscapes. Insectivorous bird flocks are key elements of avian
   biodiversity in the Amazonian ecosystem. Therefore, disentangling and
   quantifying the drivers behind their movement and space use patterns is
   of great importance for Amazonian conservation. We use a step selection
   function (SSF) approach to uncover environmental drivers behind movement
   choices. This is used to construct a mechanistic model, from which we
   derive predicted utilization distributions (home ranges) of flocks. We
   show that movement decisions are significantly influenced by canopy
   height and topography, but depletion and renewal of resources do not
   appear to affect movement significantly. We quantify the magnitude of
   these effects and demonstrate that they are helpful for understanding
   various heterogeneous aspects of space use. We compare our results to
   recent analytic derivations of space use, demonstrating that the
   analytic approximation is only accurate when assuming that there is no
   persistence in the animals' movement. Our model can be translated into
   other environments or hypothetical scenarios, such as those given by
   proposed future anthropogenic actions, to make predictions of spatial
   patterns in bird flocks. Furthermore, our approach is quite general, so
   could potentially be used to understand the drivers of movement and
   spatial patterns for a wide variety of animal communities.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{4766-4774}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Beta diversity describes how local communities within an area or region
   differ in species composition/abundance. There have been attempts to use
   changes in beta diversity as a biotic indicator of disturbance, but lack
   of theory and methodological caveats have hampered progress. We here
   propose that the neutral theory of biodiversity plus the definition of
   beta diversity as the total variance of a community matrix provide a
   suitable, novel, starting point for ecological applications. Observed
   levels of beta diversity (BD) can be compared to neutral predictions
   with three possible outcomes: Observed BD equals neutral prediction or
   is larger (divergence) or smaller (convergence) than the neutral
   prediction. Disturbance might lead to either divergence or convergence,
   depending on type and strength. We here apply these ideas to datasets
   collected on oribatid mites (a key, very diverse soil taxon) under
   several regimes of disturbances. When disturbance is expected to
   increase the heterogeneity of soil spatial properties or the sampling
   strategy encompassed a range of diverging environmental conditions, we
   observed diverging assemblages. On the contrary, we observed patterns
   consistent with neutrality when disturbance could determine
   homogenization of soil properties in space or the sampling strategy
   encompassed fairly homogeneous areas. With our method, spatial and
   temporal changes in beta diversity can be directly and easily monitored
   to detect significant changes in community dynamics, although the method
   itself cannot inform on underlying mechanisms. However, human-driven
   disturbances and the spatial scales at which they operate are usually
   known. In this case, our approach allows the formulation of testable
   predictions in terms of expected changes in beta diversity, thereby
   offering a promising monitoring tool.}},

Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{461-468}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Drilling fluid, also referred to as drilling mud, is a major waste from
   oil and gas drilling. Land application is a novel approach to potassium
   silicate drilling fluid (PSDF) waste recycling, addressing its disposal
   requirements while potentially improving soil quality for land
   reclamation. Inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer (0,34
   N: 45 P kg ha(-1)) was added with PSDF (0, 30, 45, 60 m(3) ha(-1)) as
   eight PSDF amendments. PSDF amendments were incorporated or sprayed on
   four reclamation soils (sand, loam, clay loam 1 and 2). Response to PSDF
   application was assessed in the greenhouse with two plant species
   (Hordeum vulgare L. (barley) and Agropyron trachycaulum (Link) Malte
   (slender wheat grass).
   PSDF amendments had no detrimental effects on soil quality
   (macronutrients, pH, salinity, sodicity) and plant growth except in clay
   loam 2 soil. In loam soil, barley height and biomass were greater with
   PSDF at 45 m3 ha(-1) with fertilizer relative to soil without PSDF. In
   sand soil with PSDF at the highest rate without fertilizer, wheat grass
   height was 1.08 times and biomass was 1.76 times greater than the
   control. High electrical conductivity in clay loam 2 soil, and decreased
   density, height and biomass of wheat grass at highest PSDF application
   rates or with PSDF incorporation, suggest a threshold beyond which
   conditions are compromised for PSDF application. Increasing PSDF
   application rate increased soil potassium availability by 1.6-4.1 times
   relative to no PSDF. This initial research demonstrates that PSDF may be
   an appropriate soil amendment for agricultural crops and native plant
   species on land reclamation sites with consideration of substrates

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite advances in post-mine sites reclamation methods in the recent
   years, restoration treatments are not always successful in creating
   self-sustaining ecosystems. Occasionally, vegetation remains in a state
   of arrested succession where conditions are hostile for many
   late-successional target species. An in-depth study of the environmental
   factors that control vegetation dynamics on reclaimed mined sites may,
   therefore, improve the methods for late-successional species
   introduction, rehabilitating the landscape effectively. In this context,
   using 12 reclaimed mines in northern Spain colonized mainly by two
   leguminous shrubs (Cytisus scoparius and Genista florida) we explored:
   (i) how organic-matter thickness, bryophyte cover and plant diversity
   and cover attributes change across a gradient of dominant shrub
   cover/volume, and (ii) how the understorey plant species were associated
   with these shrub canopies. We hypothesized that shrub growth modified
   the micro-climatic conditions and influenced the understorey plant
   species either by facilitation or competition. The results reveal an
   important positive effect of shrub volume on micro-environmental
   conditions, such as organic matter-thickness and bryophyte cover,
   creating environmental heterogeneity underneath larger shrub canopies.
   At the same time, the shrub volume gradient was also associated with
   species composition; there was a shift in plant composition from a
   greater abundance of annual, light-demanding species and legumes in open
   conditions towards water-requiring, shade-adapted, and broad-leaved
   species under greater shrub volumes. In contrast, there were no shrub
   effects in diversity and evenness. The analysis of individual species
   indicates that 18 out of the 40 most frequent species showed a
   significant association with shrub volume. Assessment of the species
   optima associated with shrub colonization allows the development of new
   species mixtures that are tailored to individual site conditions to
   favour desired plant communities. Moreover, it seems that shrubs acted
   as ecosystem engineers in these reclaimed mined sites. Natural shrub
   encroachment has been shown in this study as one means through which
   these ecosystems can be modified to create heterogeneity in
   micro-environmental conditions and hence inducing greater overall
   diversity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated population modelling is proving to be an important and useful
   technique in statistical ecology. However, there is currently no simple
   formal method for judging how well models fit data, when potentially
   several different data sets described by different structured models are
   being analysed in combination. We propose and evaluate a new approach,
   of calibrated simulation. Here, comparative data sets are obtained from
   simulating data when model parameter values are obtained from the
   assumed asymptotic normal distribution of the maximum-likelihood
   estimators from the real data. The approach is motivated and justified
   by Bayesian P-values. Calibration of the resulting statistics is
   achieved as repeated data sets are easily simulated from the fitted
   model. The method requires the specification of model discrepancy
   measures, and we show how different measures can highlight different
   aspects of fit. Calibration is only strictly necessary if the statistics
   proposed may appear to be extreme. The approach of using calibrated
   simulation to check the goodness-of-fit of integrated population models
   is demonstrated by application to data sets on lapwings and herons. In
   each case, there are two data sets involved in the integrated analysis,
   and for each component data set, discrepancy measures of goodness-of-fit
   are obtained. For the lapwing application, as replication is efficient,
   it is possible to calibrate the procedure simply by using additional
   simulations. The heron application is shown to be feasible, but is
   substantially harder to calibrate, due to the presence of productivity
   thresholds that need to be estimated using profile likelihood methods.
   We demonstrate the importance of taking more than one discrepancy
   measure for time-series data. Avenues for future research are outlined.

Abstract = {{Establishing protection networks to ensure that biodiversity and

   major challenge for conservation planning. The potential consequences of

   poorly represents CONUS climatic diversity. Although rare climates are
   generally well represented by the network, the most common climates are
   particularly underrepresented. Overall, 83\% of the area of the CONUS
   corresponds to climates underrepresented by the network. The addition of
   some currently unprotected federal lands to the network would enhance
   the coverage of CONUS climates. However, to fully palliate current

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1926-1944}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Complex ecological models are used to predict the consequences of
   anticipated future changes in climate and nutrient loading for lake
   water quality. These models may, however, suffer from nonuniqueness in
   that various sets of model parameter values may yield equally
   satisfactory representations of the system being modeled, but when
   applied in future scenarios these sets of values may divert considerably
   in their simulated outcomes. Compilation of an ensemble of model runs
   allows us to account for simulation variability arising from model
   parameter estimates. Thus, we propose a new approach for aquatic
   ecological models creating a more robust prediction of future water
   quality. We used our ensemble approach in an application of the widely
   used PCLake model for Danish shallow Lake Arreskov, which during the
   past two decades has demonstrated frequent shifts between turbid and
   clear water states. Despite marked variability, the span of our ensemble
   runs encapsulated 70-90\% of the observed variation in lake water
   quality. The model exercise demonstrates that future warming and
   increased nutrient loading lead to lower probability of a clear water,
   vegetation-rich state and greater likelihood of cyanobacteria dominance.
   In a 6.0 degrees C warming scenario, for instance, the current nutrient
   loading of nitrogen and phosphorus must be reduced by about 75\% to
   maintain the present ecological state of Lake Arreskov, but even in a
   near-future 2.0 degrees C warming scenario, a higher probability of a
   turbid, cyanobacteria-dominated state is predicted. As managers may wish
   to determine the probability of achieving a certain ecological state,
   our proposed ensemble approach facilitates new ways of communicating
   future stressor impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Many species with restricted ranges or poor dispersal ability will
   occupy suboptimal habitats under climate change. The practice of
   translocating populations to more suitable areas outside the known
   historical range (assisted colonization) has been advanced as a solution
   to reduce the risk of extinction in the wild. Due to the high-risk and
   bureaucratic complexities of assisted colonization, it is imperative
   that a systematic process is used to select release sites that have a
   reduced likelihood of translocation failure. Here we demonstrate how a
   spatially explicit, three-stage multiple criteria analysis (MCA) can be
   used to identify potentially suitable sites for assisted colonization of
   an endangered species. We employ this method as an initial screening
   process, prior to final selection of sites for assisted colonization of
   the critically endangered western swamp tortoise (Pseudemydura umbrina).
   This species occurs naturally in two small reserves in southwestern
   Australia, and is currently threatened by a shift to a drier climate and
   consequent changes to hydrological regimes. A literature review,
   characteristics of remnant P. umbrina habitat, and expert knowledge were
   used to create a composite index of habitat suitability, mapped across
   the entire south-west bioregion of Australia. The most suitable sites
   were 150 to 250 km south of the known range of P. umbrina, in areas of
   high landscape connectivity and low human population density. A subset
   of sites were examined in further detail and ranked using weighted
   summation. Careful use of MCA, taking into account data uncertainties
   and differences in expert opinion, can be a valuable tool when
   evaluating novel habitats for threatened species.}},

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2490-2502}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Genome architecture of a microbe markedly changes when it transitions
   from a free-living lifestyle to an obligate symbiotic association within
   eukaryotic cells. These symbiont genomes experience numerous
   rearrangements and massive gene loss, which is expected to radically
   alter gene regulatory networks compared with those of free-living
   relatives. As such, it remains unclear whether and how these small
   symbiont genomes regulate gene expression. Here, using a label-free
   mass-spec quantification approach we found that differential protein
   regulation occurs in Buchnera, a model symbiont with a reduced genome,
   when it transitions between two distinct life stages. However,
   differential mRNA expression could not be detected between Buchnera life
   stages, despite the presence of a small number of putative
   transcriptional regulators. Instead a comparative analysis of small RNA
   expression profiles among five divergent Buchnera lineages, spanning a
   variety of Buchnera life stages, reveals 140 novel intergenic and
   antisense small RNAs and 517 untranslated regions that were
   significantly expressed, some of which have been conserved for similar
   to 65 million years. In addition, the majority of these small RNAs
   exhibit both sequence covariation and thermodynamic stability,
   indicators of a potential structural RNA role. Together, these data
   suggest that gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level may be
   important in Buchnera. This is the first study to empirically identify
   Buchnera small RNAs, and we propose that these novel small RNAs may
   facilitate post-transcriptional regulation through translational
   inhibition/activation, and/or transcript stability. Ultimately,
   post-transcriptional regulation may shape metabolic complementation
   between Buchnera and its aphid host, thus impacting the animal's ecology
   and evolution.}},

Abstract = {{To successfully protect native biodiversity from the effects of
   biological invasions, local conservation priorities must be established.
   For this purpose, fine-grained species distribution data is required but
   often unavailable. We present a new approach to obtain fine-grained
   predictions of invasion through the development of downscaled invasion
   maps based on coarse-grained distribution data. The framework is
   illustrated for the alien invader Acacia dealbata in the Northwest of
   Portugal. The analytical design was divided in five steps: (1) three
   individual coarse-grained models were calibrated and their spatial
   predictions were downscaled into fine-grained models using three
   different downscaling techniques; (2) a Downscaling Consensus Map was
   built by spatially combining the predictions from those three models;
   (3) using coarse-grained (1 km(2)) or fine-grained (0.04 km(2))
   datasets, two different models were fitted and spatially projected; (4)
   for each spatial resolution, Conservation Value maps were produced,
   based on the spatial combination of the protection networks represented
   in the region; and (5) the spatial conflicts between the predicted
   distribution of the invader and Conservation Value maps were calculated
   and compared for the several invasion maps. The downscaled models showed
   high predictive performance (AUC > 0.9). The spatial projections of the
   different models revealed a general similarity among projections from
   all modelling techniques, for both the patterns of invasion and the
   conflicts with conservation areas. The possibility of obtaining detailed
   and reliable predictions based on coarse-grained distribution data could
   avoid costly fieldwork to collect fine-grained distribution data while
   effectively supporting the management of invasions at the appropriate

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The nature of conservation challenges can foster a reactive, rather than
   proactive approach to decision making. Failure to anticipate problems
   before they escalate results in the need for more costly and
   time-consuming solutions. Proactive conservation requires
   forward-looking approaches to decision making that consider possible
   futures without being overly constrained by the past. Strategic
   foresight provides a structured process for considering the most
   desirable future and for mapping the most efficient and effective
   approaches to promoting that future with tools that facilitate creative
   thinking. The process involves 6 steps: setting the scope, collecting
   inputs, analyzing signals, interpreting the information, determining how
   to act, and implementing the outcomes. Strategic foresight is ideal for
   seeking, recognizing, and realizing conservation opportunities because
   it explicitly encourages a broad-minded, forward-looking perspective on
   an issue. Despite its potential value, the foresight process is rarely
   used to address conservation issues, and previous attempts have
   generally failed to influence policy. We present the strategic foresight
   process as it can be used for proactive conservation planning,
   describing some of the key tools in the foresight tool kit and how they
   can be used to identify and exploit different types of conservation
   opportunities. Scanning is an important tool for collecting and
   organizing diverse streams of information and can be used to recognize
   new opportunities and those that could be created. Scenario planning
   explores how current trends, drivers of change, and key uncertainties
   might influence the future and can be used to identify barriers to
   opportunities. Backcasting is used to map out a path to a goal and can
   determine how to remove barriers to opportunities. We highlight how the
   foresight process was used to identify conservation opportunities during
   the development of a strategic plan to address climate change in New
   York State. The plan identified solutions that should be effective
   across a range of possible futures. Illustrating the application of
   strategic foresight to identify conservation opportunities should
   provide the impetus for decision makers to explore strategic foresight
   as a way to support more proactive conservation policy, planning, and
   management.
   Uso de la Prevision Estrategica para Evaluar Oportunidades de
   Conservacion Cook, Wintle \& Aldrich La naturaleza de los obstaculos
   para la conservacion puede albergar una estrategia reactiva, en lugar de
   una proactiva, para la toma de decisiones. Fallar en la anticipacion a
   problemas antes de que escalen resulta en la necesidad de soluciones mas
   costosas y que consumen mucho tiempo. La conservacion proactiva requiere
   estrategias con miras al futuro para la toma de decisiones que
   consideren futuros posibles sin estar muy restringidas por el pasado. La
   prevision estrategica proporciona un proceso estructurado para
   considerar el futuro mas deseable y para mapear las estrategias mas
   eficientes y efectivas para promover ese futuro con herramientas que
   faciliten el pensamiento creativo. El proceso involucra seis pasos:
   establecer el alcance, colectar aportaciones, analizar senales,
   interpretar la informacion, determinar como actuar e implementar los
   resultados. La prevision estrategica es ideal para buscar, reconocer y
   llevar a cabo oportunidades de conservacion ya que estimula
   explicitamente una perspectiva de mente abierta y con miras al futuro
   sobre algun tema. A pesar de su valor potencial, el proceso de prevision
   rara vez se usa para dirigirse a asuntos de conservacion, y en intentos
   previos han fallado generalmente en influenciar a la politica.
   Presentamos el proceso de prevision estrategica ya que puede usarse para
   la planeacion proactiva de la conservacion, para describir algunas de
   las herramientas clave en el juego de herramientas de la prevision y
   como pueden usarse para identificar y explotar diferentes tipos de
   oportunidades de conservacion. El escaneo es una herramienta importante
   para colectar y organizar diversas series de informacion y puede usarse
   para reconocer nuevas oportunidades y aquellas que podrian surgir. La
   planeacion de escenarios explora como las tendencias actuales, los
   conductores del cambio y las incertidumbres clave pueden influenciar al
   futuro y tambien puede usarse para identificar barreras que bloqueen a
   las oportunidades. Definir un futuro deseable y despues identificar
   politicas y programas que conecten al presente con el pasado se usa para
   mapear un camino hacia una meta y puede determinar como remover las
   barreras que bloqueen a las oportunidades. Resaltamos como el proceso de
   prevision se uso para identificar oportunidades de conservacion durante
   el desarrollo de un plan estrategico para abordar el cambio climatico en
   el estado de Nueva York. El plan identifico soluciones que deberian ser
   efectivas a los largo de un rango de futuros posibles. Ilustrar la
   aplicacion de la prevision estrategica para identificar oportunidades de
   conservacion deberia proporcionar a quienes toman las decisiones los
   impetus de explorar a la prevision estrategica como un metodo para
   apoyar un manejo, planeacion y politicas de conservacion mas proactivas.

Abstract = {{We propose a novel multivariate method to analyse biodiversity data
   based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. LDA, a
   probabilistic model, reduces assemblages to sets of distinct component
   communities. It produces easily interpretable results, can represent
   abrupt and gradual changes in composition, accommodates missing data and
   allows for coherent estimates of uncertainty. We illustrate our method
   using tree data for the eastern United States and from a tropical
   successional chronosequence. The model is able to detect pervasive
   declines in the oak community in Minnesota and Indiana, potentially due
   to fire suppression, increased growing season precipitation and
   herbivory. The chronosequence analysis is able to delineate clear
   successional trends in species composition, while also revealing that
   site-specific factors significantly impact these successional
   trajectories. The proposed method provides a means to decompose and
   track the dynamics of species assemblages along temporal and spatial
   gradients, including effects of global change and forest disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Genomic selection (GS) is a DNA-based method of selecting for
   quantitative traits in animal and plant breeding, and offers a
   potentially superior alternative to traditional breeding methods that
   rely on pedigree and phenotype information. Using a 60 K SNP chip with
   markers spaced throughout the entire chicken genome, we compared the
   impact of GS and traditional BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction)
   selection methods applied side-by-side in three different lines of
   egg-laying chickens. Differences were demonstrated between methods, both
   at the level and genomic distribution of allele frequency changes. In
   all three lines, the average allele frequency changes were larger with
   GS, 0.056 0.064 and 0.066, compared with BLUP, 0.044, 0.045 and 0.036
   for lines B1, B2 and W1, respectively. With BLUP, 35 selected regions
   (empirical P<0.05) were identified across the three lines. With GS, 70
   selected regions were identified. Empirical thresholds for local allele
   frequency changes were determined from gene dropping, and differed
   considerably between GS (0.167-0.198) and BLUP (0.105-0.126). Between
   lines, the genomic regions with large changes in allele frequencies
   showed limited overlap. Our results show that GS applies selection
   pressure much more locally than BLUP, resulting in larger allele
   frequency changes. With these results, novel insights into the nature of
   selection on quantitative traits have been gained and important
   questions regarding the long-term impact of GS are raised. The rapid
   changes to a part of the genetic architecture, while another part may
   not be selected, at least in the short term, require careful
   consideration, especially when selection occurs before phenotypes are
   observed.}},

   choice is likely to include sequential sampling at prospective sites, a
   decision rule for accepting a site, and, when available, use of prior
   experience. Here, I consider the threshold rule (Real 1990 American
   Naturalist, 138, 901-917) in which individuals choose the first option
   that exceeds a preset level of quality and ask how competition for sites
   limits the choosiness of individuals applying the threshold rule. I then
   investigate how the addition of site fidelity further influences the
   evolution of individual choosiness via a threshold rule. I develop an
   individual-based model that uses a genetic algorithm approach to search
   for the optimal threshold as an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) and
   equilibrium population size. Territory quality (i.e. likelihood of
   reproductive success) is spatially heterogeneous. Individuals either use
   the acceptance threshold alone or together with site fidelity. In the
   latter strategy, successful breeders that survive remain at their former
   site as incumbents, whereas unsuccessful breeders move to a new site.
   Results indicate greater competition for sites increases the acceptance
   threshold and reduces choosiness even when individuals have perfect
   information from sampled sites. Incumbency, via site fidelity at
   successful territories, leads to the evolution of relatively unselective
   behaviour, the degree to which is influenced by the level of adult
   survival. Competition for sites and site pre-emption, rather than
   energetic or mortality costs, may drive the evolution of choosiness. The
   analysis also highlights the importance of considering coexisting
   strategies used by individuals and not simply the population. For
   instance, site fidelity, as a coexisting strategy, can result in an ESS
   acceptance threshold that is no better than random selection, and yet
   still safeguard populations from extinction. <doi origin={''}wiley{''}

Abstract = {{The application of the eddy covariance flux method to measure fluxes of
   trace gas and energy between ecosystems and the atmosphere has exploded
   over the past 25years. This opinion paper provides a perspective on the
   contributions and future opportunities of the eddy covariance method.
   First, the paper discusses the pros and cons of this method relative to
   other methods used to measure the exchange of trace gases between
   ecosystems and the atmosphere. Second, it discusses how the use of eddy
   covariance method has grown and evolved. Today, more than 400 flux
   measurement sites are operating world-wide and the duration of the time
   series exceed a decade at dozens of sites. Networks of tower sites now
   enable scientists to ask scientific questions related to climatic and
   ecological gradients, disturbance, changes in land use, and management.
   The paper ends with discussions on where the field of flux measurement
   is heading. Topics discussed include role of open access data sharing
   and data mining, in this new era of big data, and opportunities new
   sensors that measure a variety of trace gases, like volatile organic
   carbon compounds, methane and nitrous oxide, and aerosols, may yield.}},
