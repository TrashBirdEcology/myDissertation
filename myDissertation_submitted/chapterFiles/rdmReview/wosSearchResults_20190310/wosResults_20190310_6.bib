Abstract = {{Rangeland ecological condition was monitored over a 48 year period on 41
   sites on Bureau of Land Management rangelands scattered across 6
   counties in southwestern New Mexico. All sites were grazed by livestock
   during the study period. Sampling occurred in 1952, 1962, 1982, 1992,
   1997, 1998, and 1999. A modified Parker 3 step method in conjunction
   with Dyksterhuis quantitative climax procedures were used to determine
   rangeland ecological condition. At the end of the 48 year study period
   (1952-1999), the average rangeland ecological condition score across
   study sites was the same (P > 0.05) as the beginning of the study (39\%
   versus 41\% remaining climax vegetation. respectively). Major changes (P
   > 0.05) in rangeland condition occurred within the study period due to
   annual fluctuations in precipitation. Ecological condition scores
   increased in the 1980s and early 1990s due to above average
   precipitation. However, drought in the early to mid 1950's and again in
   the mid to late 1990's caused rangeland condition scores to decline. At
   the end of the study (1997-1999), 38\% of the sites were in late seral
   ecological condition, compared to an average of 25\% in the 1952 to 1982
   period. The amount of rangeland in late seral ecological condition
   increased while the amount of rangeland in mid seral and early seral
   condition decreased in the 1990s compared to the 1952-1962 period. The
   average percent cover of black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda Torr.) and
   tobosa (Hilaria mutica Buckley), the primary forage grasses in the
   Chihuahuan Desert, were the same (P > 0.05) in 1952 and 1999. Over the
   48 year study period, the average cover of shrubs including honey
   mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.) showed no change (P > 0.05).
   However major increases in honey mesquite basal cover occurred on 1 site
   and creosotebush (Larria tridentata {[}Pursh] Nutt.) increased on
   another. Grazing intensity was evaluated during the last 3 years of
   study (1997, 1998, 1999). Overall grazing use of forage across sites and
   years averaged 34\% or conservative. Our research shows controlled
   livestock grazing is sustainable on Chihuahuan Desert rangelands
   receiving from 26-35 cm annual precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first analysis of riparian vegetation types on the Arctic
   Slope of Alaska including classification and ordination. We classified
   riparian willow communities according to the Braun-Blanquet approach,
   and analvsed environmental relationships of associations to complex
   environmental gradients using Detrended Correspondence Analysis. We also
   examined synecological differences in terms of community characteristics
   (e.g. growth form distributions, species richness, soil pH and climatic
   affinities, phytogeographic patterns) to better understand ecological
   alteration processes and changing species compositions along
   successional gradients. Data were collected along a transect from the
   Brooks Range to Prudhoe Bay, primarily in the watersheds of
   Sagavanirktok River and Kuparuk River. Riparian vegetation in arctic
   Alaska mainly consists of willow shrub communities which are
   functionally important components of arctic landscape ecosystems. A
   combination of edaphic conditions (soil pH, soil moisture) and factors
   related to topography, disturbance regime and landscape evolution (river
   terrace/stream bank development) controls spatial patterns and floristic
   compositions of riparian plant communities. Classification resulted in
   three associations and four subassociations, each occupying distinct
   riparian habitats, and, thus, indicating distinct environmental
   conditions.
   The Epilobio-Salicetum alaxensis ass. nov. is a true pioneer community
   along mountain creeks (subass. polemonietosum acutiflori) and on gravel
   bars, floodplains and lower terraces of rivers (subass. parnassietosum
   kotzebuei). This tall willow association indicates sites with frequent
   disturbances and coarser-textured, relatively dry, initial alluvial
   soils with basic reaction that have deep active layers and relatively
   high soil temperatures. The association may persist on river banks as
   long as erosion and deposition of new increments of alluvium occurs,
   i.e. as long as predominantly allogenic processes are operative in
   succession cycles. It is characterized by relatively low species
   richness, p considerable percentage of North American endemics, higher
   amount of more thermophilous species and comparatively higher cover
   percentage of forbs.
   Higher terraces show the paradoxon of better developed soils and
   decreasing productivity of the shrub layer. With decreasing river
   influence and the transition to finer-textured, more nutrient-rich, less
   basic soils, the tall willow community is replaced by the
   Anemono-Salicetum richardsonii ass. nov. (subass. lupinetosum arctici).
   Decreasing active layer depth, caused by the insulation of a thick moss
   layer and consequently lower soil temperatures, as well as lower root
   activity and rooting space, and higher soil moisture reduce the
   competitiveness of Salix alaxensis-stands and are thus key factors for
   this successional replacement with low willows. The Anemono-Salicetum
   richardsonii characterizes later stages of succession on river alluvium
   with predominantly autogenic processes resulting inter alia in an
   uniquely arctic soil thermal regime. Shrubs and mosses are dominant
   growth forms in this association, which is further characterized by
   comparatively highest species richness. It also occurs on upland tundra
   stream banks (subass. salicetosum pulchrae), where environmental
   conditions and floristic composition point to a certain affinity to the
   Valeriano-Salicetum pulchrae ass. nov,
   The latter association is distributed on older, long-deglaciated land
   surfaces with paludified, loamy, acid soils with massive ground ice and
   thick moss layers, resulting in cold soils, decreased depth of thaw, and
   increased soil moisture. It typically occupies the immediate margins of
   smaller tundra streams and creeks with a specific streamflow regime (low
   disturbance level), originating in the gentle topography of the
   foothills. Water saturation of the soils lead to reduced decomposition
   of organic residues and thus to high contents of organic matter.
   Percentage of acidophilous species and of more cold-adapted species as
   well as moss cover and bryophyte species richness are comparatively very
   high. This terminal riparian vegetation type seems to be connected to
   long-established hydrologic patterns and associated riparian ecosystem
   evolution along headwaters in upland tundra, and has developed in other
   time scales compared to the above associations.
   Due to synecological and physiognomic correspondences and floristic
   similarities in supraregional and circumpolar perspective, North Alaskan
   riparian willow associations can be assigned to existing higher
   syntaxonomic units of the Braun-Blanquet system, established in Europe
   and Greenland. Strong affinities do exist to alluvial willow
   associations of the Salicetea purpureae. We propose to extend the range
   of this class to the North American Arctic.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Although ecological managers typically focus on managing local or
   regional landscapes, they often have little ability to control or
   predict many of the large-scale, long-term processes that drive changes
   within these landscapes. This lack of control has led some ecologists to
   argue that ecological management should aim to produce ecosystems that
   are resilient to change and surprise. Unfortunately, ecological
   resilience is difficult to measure or estimate in the landscapes people
   manage. In this paper, I extend system dynamics approaches to resilience
   and estimate resilience using complex landscape simulation models. I use
   this approach to evaluate cross-scale edge, a novel empirical method for
   estimating resilience based on landscape pattern. Cross-scale edge
   provides relatively robust estimates of resilience, suggesting that,
   with some further developments it could be used as a management tool to
   provide rough and rapid estimates of areas of resilience and
   vulnerability within a landscape.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new model of the terrestrial carbon cycle
   (Sim-CYCLE), with the objectives of retrieving the carbon dynamics of
   various terrestrial ecosystems and estimating their response to global
   environmental change. The model can be characterized in three ways. (1)
   It is a compartment model. Ecosystem carbon storage is divided into five
   compartments; foliage, stem, root, litter, and mineral soil. This
   approach made the model simple and sound, and allowed us to run the
   model on a broad scale; indeed, the simulation in this paper was
   performed using data available at the global scale. (2) It is a
   process-based model. Sim-CYCLE estimates net primary production (NPP)
   and net ecosystem production (NEP) by explicitly calculating such carbon
   fluxes as gross primary production (GPP), plant respiration, and soil
   decomposition on a monthly time-step; these fluxes are regulated by a
   multitude of environmental factors at the physiological scale. In
   relation to global change, responses to increased atmospheric CO, and
   temperature should be modeled in a mechanistic manner. (3) It is a
   prognostic model. Sim-CYCLE is designed to be applicable not only to the
   simulation of an equilibrium state under given conditions, but also to
   the prediction of a transitional state under changing environmental
   conditions. Importantly, Sim-CYCLE is based on the dry-matter production
   theory, which enabled us to achieve the scaling-up from single-leaf to
   canopy and to conceptualize the growth process. Since the model includes
   both radiation and hydrological conditions, some indirect influences of
   the initial environmental change can be properly evaluated. We present a
   comprehensive model description and preliminary results confirmed at the
   plot scale: (1) intensively in four natural ecosystems and (2)
   extensively in global 21 sites. At each site, model parameters were
   calibrated to capture the observed carbon dynamics (e.g. productivity
   and carbon storage) at the equilibrium state. Successional growth
   patterns and seasonal variations in CO, exchange were also examined in a
   qualitative manner. Sim-CYCLE successfully expressed the differences
   between tropical forest and boreal forest and between humid forest and
   and grassland in terms of productivity and carbon storage. Next, we
   simulated transitional ecosystem carbon dynamics, in response to
   step-wise atmospheric CO, doubling and disturbance regime. The simulated
   temporal patterns of carbon cycle were realistic and ensured that
   Sim-CYCLE is an effective tool for predicting the impact of global
   change. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, the distinction between meraspis and holaspis among
   trilobites has been based on the achievement of the full adult
   complement of thoracic segments. Using a large sample (over 700
   specimens collected from a single bed) we explore the utility of
   employing the ontogenetic trajectory of the cranidium as an alternative
   means to differentiate trilobite growth stages. This method is
   particularly useful for species represented solely by exuviae and
   disarticulated individuals. We use geometric morphometrics to examine
   shape change among cranidia ranging in size from 0.9 mm to 11.6 mm in
   cephalic length. The 114 measured specimens exhibit a rather continuous
   gradation in size in which no distinct instars are evident.
   The meraspid and holaspid specimens exhibit allometry when partial warp
   scores and uniform components of shape derived from thin-plate spline
   analysis are regressed onto log centroid size. To describe allometric
   shape change, deformation vectors from the smallest to the largest
   specimen in both ontogenetic stages are presented in three different
   superimposition settings by using a new software program. We have
   concluded that a new superimposition method (the Sliding Baseline
   Registration) is a useful tool for visualizing allometry in organisms
   that contain an axis of symmetry. As a result, we conclude that
   allometry is evident in meraspides and holaspides, but the degree of
   allometry in holaspides is very small relative to that in meraspides.
   The boundary between meraspis and holaspis in Triarthrus becki appears
   to correspond to a large change in the rate of ontogenetic change, but
   neither to a change in the direction of that trajectory nor to a
   cessation of ontogenetic change. This boundary also corresponds to a
   cranidium centroid size that matches well previous determinations that
   holaspis begins at about 2.8 mm in cephalic length.}},

Abstract = {{Two sympatric species of the genus Phaleria living on the beach of
   Burano (GR, Italy) were studied. Fortnightly samplings were made for a
   period of an entire year (from January to December 1996). Two transects
   of pitfall traps, spanning from mean sea level to the unvegetated limits
   of the beach, were arranged perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline
   so as to capture spontaneously active individuals. So as to better
   understand the life cycle of the Phaleria genus, another locality
   (Collelungo), where only Phaleria provincialis was present, was chosen.
   Samplings were fortnightly from January to December 1999. Sand patches
   of 0.25 m(2) were sieved every 2 in along a transect from mean sea level
   to the base of the dune. Organic detritus was collected and weighed in
   the laboratory. Through such a method, darkling beetles could be sampled
   during their resting phase so as to obtain information on their
   zonation. In the laboratory, all adults were dissected, sexed, ovarioles
   extracted and oocytes measured. For adults and larvae from Collelungo,
   morphometric measurements were made and larvae were classed. Annual
   distributions in both study localities indicated that the species are
   typically univoltine, with over-wintering adults and emergence of the
   new generation from summer to autumn. The life cycle of R bimaculata was
   shifted in comparison to that of R provincialis, showing greater
   eurythermal characteristics for the first species. Numerical differences

Abstract = {{The impacts of climate change on Mediterranean-type ecosystems may
   result from complex interactions between direct effects on water stress
   and subsequent modifications in flammability and fire regime leading to
   changes in standing biomass and plant species composition. We analysed
   these interrelations through a simulation approach combining scenarios
   of climate change developed from GCM results and a multispecies
   functional model for vegetation dynamics, SIERRA. A fire risk procedure
   based on weekly estimates of vegetation water stress has been
   implemented. Using climate data from 1960 to 1997, simulations of a
   typical maquis woodland community have been performed as baseline and
   compared with two climate scenarios: a change in the rainfall regime
   alone, and changes in both rainfall and air temperature. Climate changes
   are defined by an increase in temperature, particularly in summer, and a
   change in the rainfall pattern leading to a decrease in low rainfall
   events, and an increase in intense rainfall events. The results
   illustrate the lack of drastic changes in the succession process, but
   highlight modifications in the water budget and in the length of the
   drought periods. Water stress lower than expected regarding statistics
   on the current climate is simulated, emphasizing a long-term new
   equilibrium of vegetation to summer drought but with a higher
   sensibility to rare events. Regarding fire frequency, climate changes
   tend to decrease the time interval between two successive fires from 20
   to 16 years for the maquis shrubland and from 72 to 62 years in the
   forested stages. This increase in fire frequency leads to
   shrub-dominated landscapes, which accentuates the yield of water by
   additional deep drainage and runoff.}},

Abstract = {{The most dramatic changes in natural environments caused by human
   recreation are often during the initial use of a site, when the most
   susceptible and fragile species are disturbed. Approaches to managing
   the effects of recreational activities often assume that site impacts
   accumulate under sustained patterns of use and that the rate of
   accumulation is predictably related to the amount of initial use that
   individual sites receive. We investigated the patterns of impact caused
   by the experimental opening of two new scuba diving sites in the Great
   Barrier Reef Marine Park, Queensland, Australia. Changes in the
   abundance and condition of corals at the dive sites and two undived
   (control) sites were monitored for 5 mo before the sites were opened and
   for a further 13 mo after regular dive visits began. Sampling was
   stratified at increasing distances (0, 40, and 80 in) away from the
   point of entry to each site to determine spatial patterns of impact.
   Despite regular use of the sites by dive charters, impacts occurred as
   repeated discrete pulses in coral damage that were spatially and
   temporally heterogeneous. Increases in the density of broken branching
   corals were typically short-term and occurred asynchronously within a
   single stratum or dive site. Our results show that repeated use of coral
   reef dive sites does not necessarily lead to cumulative deterioration in
   their condition. The heterogeneous patterns of impact that we detected
   appear to be associated with variability in diver behavior and to the
   relatively rapid growth of broken coral branches. To limit damage in
   these popular environments, management actions that identify and
   mitigate the causes of damaging behavior are likely to be more pragmatic
   and efficient than setting numerical limits to site use.}},

Pages = {{1146-1161}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Among the various forms of canonical analysis available in the
   statistical literature, RDA (redundancy analysis) and CCA (canonical
   correspondence analysis) have become instruments of choice for
   ecological research because they recognize different roles for the
   explanatory and response data tables. Data table Y contains the response
   variables (e.g., species data) while data table X contains the
   explanatory variables. RDA is an extension of multiple linear
   regression; it uses a linear model of relationship between the variables
   in X and Y. In CCA, the response variables are chi-square transformed as
   the initial step, but the relationship between the transformed response
   data and the explanatory variables in X is still assumed to be linear.
   There is no special reason why nature should linearly relate changes in
   species assemblages to changes in environmental variables, When modeling
   ecological processes, to assume linearity is unrealistic in most
   instances and is only done because more appropriate methods of analysis
   are not available. We propose two empirical methods of canonical
   analysis based on polynomial regression to do away with the assumption
   of linearity in modeling the relationships between the variables in X
   and Y. They are called polynomial RDA and polynomial CCA, respectively.
   and may be viewed as alternatives to classical linear RDA and CCA.
   Because the analysis uses nonlinear functions of the explanatory
   variables, new ways of representing these variables in biplot diagrams
   have been developed. The use of these methods is demonstrated on real
   data sets and using simulations. In the examples, the new techniques
   produced a noticeable increase in the amount of variation of Y accounted
   for by the model, compared to standard linear RDA and CCA. Freeware to
   carry out the new analyses is available in ESA's Electronic Data
   Archive, Ecological Archives.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Note = {{1st International Symposium on Riverine Landscapes, ASCONA, SWITZERLAND,

Abstract = {{1. The aim of ecological risk assessments is to evaluate the likelihood
   that ecosystems are adversely affected by human-induced disturbance that
   brings the ecosystem into a new dynamic equilibrium with a simpler
   structure and lower potential energy. The risk probability depends on
   the threshold capacity of the system (resistance) and on the capacity of
   the system to return to a state of equilibrium (resilience).
   2. There are two complementary approaches to assessing ecological risks
   of riverine landscape dynamics. The reductionist approach aims at
   identifying risk to the ecosystem on the basis of accumulated data on
   simple stressor-effect relationships. The holistic approach aims at
   taking the whole ecosystem performance into account, which implies
   meso-scale analysis.
   3. Landscape patterns and their dynamics represent the physical
   framework of processes determining the ecosystem's equilibrium.
   Assessing risks of landscape dynamics to riverine ecosystems implies
   addressing complex interactions of system components (e.g. population
   dynamics and biogeochemical cycles) occurring at multiple scales of
   space and time.
   4. One of the most important steps in ecological risk assessment is to
   establish clear assessment endpoints (e.g. vital ecosystem and landscape
   attributes). Their formulation must recognise that riverine ecosystems
   are dynamic, structurally complex and composed of both deterministic and
   stochastic components.
   5. Remote sensing (geo)statistics and geographical information systems
   are primary tools for quantifying spatial and temporal components of
   riverine ecosystem and landscape attributes.
   6. The difficulty to experiment at the riverine landscape level means
   that ecological risk management is heavily dependent on models. Current
   models are targeted towards simulating ecological risk at levels ranging
   from single species to habitats, food webs and meta-populations to
   ecosystems and entire riverine landscapes, with some including
   socioeconomic considerations.}},

Abstract = {{Land use can exert a powerful influence on ecological systems, yet our
   understanding of the natural and social factors that influence land use
   and land-cover change is incomplete. We studied land-cover change in an
   area of about 8800 km(2) along the lower part of the Wisconsin River, a
   landscape largely dominated by agriculture. Our goals were (a) to
   quantify changes in land cover between 1938 and 1992, (b) to evaluate
   the influence of abiotic and socioeconomic variables on land cover in
   1938 and 1992, and (c) to characterize the major processes of land-cover
   change between these two points in time. The results showed a general
   shift from agricultural land to forest. Cropland declined from covering
   44\% to 32\% of the study area, while forests and grassland both
   increased (from 32\% to 38\% and from 10\% to 14\% respectively).
   Multiple linear regressions using three abiotic and two socioeconomic
   variables captured 6\% to 36\% of the variation in land-cover categories
   in 1938 and 9\% to 46\% of the variation in 1992. Including
   socioeconomic variables always increased model performance. Agricultural
   abandonment and a general decline in farming intensity were the most
   important processes of land-cover change among the processes considered.
   Areas characterized by the different processes of land-cover change
   differed in the abiotic and socioeconomic variables that had explanatory
   power and can be distinguished spatially. Understanding the dynamics of
   landscapes dominated by human impacts requires methods to incorporate
   socioeconomic variables and anthropogenic processes in the analyses. Our
   method of hypothesizing and testing major anthropogenic processes may be
   a useful tool for studying the dynamics of cultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple generations of rhizome-connected tillers stabilize soils and
   produce measurable amounts of herbage on sandy rangeland throughout the
   world. However, little is known about the dynamics of rhizome
   development in these clonal plant species. Seasonal relationships
   between foliar characteristics and rhizomes of prairie sandreed
   {[}Calainovilfa longifolia (Hook) Scribn.] were examined on sands range
   sites at 30-day intervals from May through September 1989 and 1990 at
   the University of Nebraska, Panhandle Experimental Range near
   Scottsbluff. Quadrats were excavated each year from two, 5 x 5 Latin
   Square macroplots in each of 2 grazing histories, long-term rest or
   current-year deferment. Under dry conditions in 1989, a 65\% reduction
   in the length of new rhizomes during July preceded a 64\% reduction in
   live tillers in August. After which, rhizome length and live tiller
   density were unchanged and mean tiller weight increased during
   September. When average precipitation occurred in 1990, a 25\% reduction
   in live tillers and concurrent increases in new rhizome length and mean
   tiller weight occurred during July. Rhizome bud densities increased
   throughout the growing season at different but predictable rates (R-2
   greater than or equal to 0.95) for grazing histories, regardless of
   precipitation. Length of new rhizomes was highly correlated (R-2 = 0.91)
   with live herbage throughout the growing season. Measurable increases in
   total rhizome length did not occur until live herbage of prairie
   sandreed exceeded a threshold of about 50 g m(-2). Maximum increase in
   length of new rhizomes per unit of live herbage was about 10 cm g(-1)
   near 100 g m(-2). Given its dependence on vegetative reproduction and
   relatively high palatability to beef cattle, periodic or repeated years
   of full growing season deferment may be the only reliable method of
   obtaining measurable increases in prairie sandreed populations.}},

Title = {{Predator functional responses: Discriminating between handling and

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{95-112}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We present a handy mechanistic functional response model that
   realistically incorporates handling (i.e., attacking and eating) and
   digesting prey. We briefly review current functional response theory and
   thereby demonstrate that such a model has been lacking so far. In our
   model, we treat digestion as a background process that does not prevent
   further foraging activities (i.e., searching and handling). Instead, we
   let the hunger level determine the probability that the predator
   searches for new prey. Additionally, our model takes into account time
   wasted through unsuccessful attacks. Since a main assumption of our
   model is that the predator's hunger is in a steady state, we term it the
   steady-state satiation (SSS) equation.
   The SSS equation yields a new formula for the asymptotic maximum
   predation rate (i.e., asymptotic maximum number of prey eaten per unit
   time, for prey density approaching infinity). According to this formula,
   maximum predation rate is determined not by the sum of the time spent
   for handling and digesting prey, but solely by the larger of these two
   terms. As a consequence, predators can be categorized into two types:
   handling-limited predators (where maximum predation rate is limited by
   handling time) and digestion-limited predators (where maximum predation
   rate is limited by digestion time). We give examples of both predator
   types. Based on available data, we suggest that most predators are
   digestion limited.
   The SSS equation is a conceptual mechanistic model. Two possible
   applications of this model are that (1) it can be used to calculate the
   effects of changing predator or prey characteristics (e.g., defenses) on
   predation rate and (2) optimal foraging models based on the SSS equation
   are testable alternatives to other approaches. This may improve optimal
   foraging theory, since one of its major problems has been the lack of
   alternative models.}},

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{61}},

Pages = {{49-71}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Uncovering why spatial mosaics of mimetic morphs are maintained in a
   Mullerian mimicry system has been a challenging issue in evolutionary
   biology. In this article, we analyze the reaction diffusion system that
   describes two-species Mullerian mimicry in one- and two-dimensional
   habitats. Due to positive frequency-dependent selection, a local
   population first approaches the state where one of the comimicking
   patterns predominates, which is followed by slow movement of boundaries
   where different patterns meet. We then analyze the interfacial dynamics
   of the boundaries to find whether a stable cline is maintained and to
   obtain the wave speed if the cline is unstable. The results are: (1) In
   a spatially uniform habitat the morph with greater base fitness spreads
   both in one and two species system. (2) The strength of cross-species
   interaction determines whether the mimetic morph clines of model and
   mimic species coalesce into the same geographical region or pass through
   each other. The joint wave speed of clines decreases by increasing the
   number of comimicking species in the mimicry ring. (3) In spatial
   heterogeneous habitats, stable clines can be maintained due to the
   balance between the base fitness gradient and the biased gene flow by
   negative curvature of boundary. This allows the persistence of a spatial
   mosaic even if one of the morphs is in every place advantageous over the
   other. A balanced cline is also maintained if there is a gradient in the
   population density. (4) A new advantageous morph occurring at a local
   region is doomed to go to extinction in a finite time if the
   ``radius{''} of initial distribution is below a threshold. Possible
   applications to the heliconiine butterfly mimicry ring, heterozygous
   disadvantage systems of chromosomal rearrangement and hybrid zone, the
   third phase of Wright's Shifting Balance theory, and cytoplasmic

Abstract = {{Acclimation of domestic animals to high environmental temperature
   typically results in lower production as animals lower their metabolic
   rate and feed intake to accommodate the increased heat load, (1).
   Ideally, one would like to simultaneously select for increased
   production and thermal resistance to increased thermal load. This will
   require simultaneous identification and selection for improved heat
   dissipation and production mechanisms. Rate of genetic progress in
   domestic animal breeding programs is driven by 3 factors; accuracy of
   markers for phenotypic traits, intensity of marker use and generation
   interval. Improved tools in molecular analysis of gene expression will
   permit improvement in the accuracy and intensity of use of genetic
   markers. New techniques in reproductive biology will permit reduction of
   generation interval. Collectively, these new techniques offer real
   opportunity to improve tolerance for environmental heat stress in
   domestic animals. Presently, genetic markers for phenotypic traits do
   not generally correspond to the coding regions for the genes of
   interest. They are located close to loci of traits of interest but lose
   their value over time due to genetic recombination. Ideally, genetic
   markers should identify the exact location of the gene of interest.
   Thus, identifying these genes is a major objective of any breeding
   program. Combining use of consomic lines of rats with single gene
   deletions and gene expression microarrays that permit evaluation of
   expression levels of thousands of genes at a time will rapidly increase
   knowledge of genes associated with tolerance or sensitivity to
   environmental heat stress. Targets of potential genetic manipulation
   would include increased efficiency and capacity of thermal effectors and
   delayed onset of temperature threshold for thermal injury. For example,
   constitutive elevation of heat shock protein gene expression has been
   shown to be cytoprotective against thermal injury in rats. This approach
   has not yet been tested in domestic animals. Likewise, treatment of
   lactating dairy cows with bovine somatotropin has been shown to increase
   evaporative heat loss capacity. Understanding the molecular basis for
   the increased evaporative heat loss capability offers new opportunities
   for increasing thermal tolerance of cattle in warm climates. Finally,
   unraveling molecular changes associated with seasonal acclimation will
   offer new insights into selecting domestic animals for thermal
   tolerance.}},

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{183-193}},
Abstract = {{We applied a novel analysis based on distance statistics to investigate
   how patterns of habitat heterogeneity affected the distribution of
   representative ground and rove beetle species (Coleoptera: Carabidae,
   Staphylinidae), sampled at an upland site of varied landform, soil and
   vegetation structure. The structural heterogeneity of the Nardus
   stricta-dominated grassland was further modified by varying grazing
   intensity with sheep, or sheep and cattle. We collected pitfall trap
   data from 120 sample points across the study area. Ground and rove
   beetle species were selected to represent the major trends in the
   species-trap abundance data, determined by the extent of their
   correlation with the main components of a factor analysis (Principal
   Components Analysis).
   The novel statistical analytical method, calculation of the Getis and
   Ord distance statistic, G, was applied to the distribution data of each
   selected species of ground and rove beetle. The distance statistic was
   calculated fur the smallest distance to ensure that each sample point
   had at least one neighbour (73 m) and this distance was used to detect
   local spatial association and to explore the location and spatial scale
   of aggregations of each beetle species over the hillside. Clusters of
   high and low G(z) values were mapped to indicate the species' functional
   heterogeneity compared with habitat heterogeneity determined by
   landform, soils or grazing management.
   The small number of large aggregations indicated the sensitivity of
   certain species to patterns of landform (Calathus melanocephalus and
   Pterostichus adstrictus). More aggregations of smaller size, coinciding
   with the pattern of particular grazing regimes indicated species
   sensitive to grazing intensity and species of mammalian herbivore
   (Carabus problematicus and Olophrum piceum). The aggregations of Othius
   angustus and Philonthus decorus related to landform, and suggested these
   species may have been directly responding to soil moisture and patterns
   of trampling by grazers. The method distinguished between those species
   that are sensitive to land use change and those that may be affected
   more by climate change.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-10}},

Abstract = {{Coevolutionary hypotheses (COEV) predict that parasitic birds become
   more specialized in host selection over time as more host species evolve
   defenses. A contrasting model, PHYLO, suggests that brood parasites
   exhibit a phylogenetic trajectory toward increasing generalization
   because there is a positive correlation between present-day numbers of
   host species and the branching order of parasitic cowbird species in a
   DNA-based phylogeny. However, this apparent phylogenetic pattern does
   not conflict with COEV, as some have concluded. Assuming allopatric
   speciation, which is supported by an area cladogram, COEV predicts a
   correlation between branching order and host number because the
   potential hosts of the earliest cowbirds to branch off have had the
   greatest amount of time to evolve defenses. Although PHYLO is more
   parsimonious than COEV, the difference is trivial, with the latter
   requiring only one more evolutionary change in the entire cowbird clade
   to produce the pattern that exists today. Support for COEV over PHYLO
   comes from brood parasitic cuckoos, which are much more specialized than
   parasitic cowbirds and represent an older clade, as shown by new DNA
   data. Cuckoos also have lower interspecific variance in host numbers
   than do cowbirds, which conflicts with PHYLO. Unlike COEV, which assumes
   that the number of hosts a parasite uses is related at least as much to
   present ecological conditions as to phylogenetic history, PHYLO assumes
   that current host numbers reflect historical character states. However,
   host number is labile, with as much variation within as between species.
   Nor are published host numbers reliable measures of parasite host
   selectivity, as they are due in part to researcher effort and range
   size. Although the comparative approach can provide insights into
   evolutionary history, some coevolved features may be too dynamic to
   retain a phylogenetic signature, and, in the case of parasitic birds,
   neither PHYLO nor COEV can be invalidated, although the latter is more
   consistent with available evidence. Strict adherence to parsimony may
   often be inappropriate when assessing coevolved characters.}},

Abstract = {{The types of technology change catalyzed by research interventions in
   integrated natural resource management (INRM) are likely to require much
   more social negotiation and adaptation than are changes related to plant
   breeding, the dominant discipline within the system of the Consultative
   Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). Conceptual models
   for developing and delivering high-yielding varieties have proven
   inadequate for delivering natural resource management (NRM) technologies
   that are adopted in farmers' fields. Successful INRM requires tools and
   approaches that can blend the technical with the social, so that people
   from different disciplines and social backgrounds can effectively work
   and communicate with each other. This paper develops the
   ``follow-the-technology{''} (FTT) approach to catalyzing, managing, and
   evaluating rural technology change as a framework that both ``hard{''}
   and ``soft{''} scientists can work with. To deal with complexity, INRM
   needs ways of working that are adaptive and flexible. The FIT approach
   uses technology as the entry point into a complex situation to determine
   what is important. In this way, it narrows the research arena to
   achievable boundaries. The methodology can also be used to catalyze
   technology change, both within and outside agriculture. The FTT approach
   can make it possible to channel the innovative potential of local people
   that is necessary in INRM to ``scale up{''} from the pilot site to the
   landscape. The FTT approach is built on an analogy between technology
   change and Darwinian evolution, specifically between ``learning
   selection{''} and natural selection. In learning selection, stakeholders
   experiment with a new technology and carry out the evolutionary roles of
   novelty generation, selection, and promulgation. The motivation to
   participate is a ``plausible promise{''} made by the R\&D team to solve
   a real farming problem. Case studies are presented from a spectrum of
   technologies to show that repeated learning selection cycles can result
   in an improvement in the performance of the plausible promise through

Journal = {{CONSERVATION ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Making decisions in natural resource management involves an
   understanding of the risk and uncertainty of the outcomes, such as crop
   failure or cattle starvation, and of the normal spread of the expected
   production. Hedging against poor outcomes often means lack of investment
   and slow adoption of new methods. At the household level, production
   instability can have serious effects on income and food security. At the
   national level, it can have social and economic impacts that may affect
   all sectors of society. Crop models such as CERES-Maize are excellent
   tools for assessing weather-related production variability. WATBAL is a
   water balance model that can provide robust estimates of the potential
   growing days for a pasture. These models require large quantities of
   daily weather data that are rarely available. MarkSim is an application
   for generating synthetic daily weather files by estimating the
   third-order Markov model parameters from interpolated climate surfaces.
   The models can then be run for each distinct point on the map. This
   paper examines the growth of maize and pasture in dryland agriculture in
   southern Africa. Weather simulators produce independent estimates for
   each point on the map; however, we know that a spatial coherence of
   weather exists. We investigated a method of incorporating spatial
   coherence into MarkSim and show that it increases the variance of
   production. This means that all of the farmers in a coherent area share
   poor yields, with important consequences for food security, markets,
   transport, and shared grazing lands. The long-term aspects of risk are
   associated with global climate change. We used the results of a Global
   Circulation Model to extrapolate to the year 2055. We found that low
   maize yields would become more likely in the marginal areas, whereas
   they may actually increase in some areas. The same trend was found with
   pasture growth. We outline areas where further work is required before
   these tools and methods can address natural resource management problems
   in a comprehensive manner at local community and policy levels.}},

Abstract = {{In a clear-felled area, soil moisture dynamics was monitored after

   Blansko. Altitude 620 m, latitude 49degrees 26' 31{''} N, longitude
   16degrees 41' 20{''} E. It is a case of a gentle slope, SE aspect. After
   felling, whole trees including crowns were skidded and the clear-cut was
   planted with Norway spruce seedlings by a new technology using a PH 4 -
   010 disk furrow planter. The direction of planting furrows followed the
   contour lines and the spacing of plants was 2.5 x 2.0 m. Soil moisture
   dynamics was measured by the capacity method from April 1979 to October
   1986 mainly with a week periodicity. The soil profile is formed by
   typical Cambisol on weathered granodiorite with the moder form of forest
   floor. As far as the soil texture is concerned upper part of the soil
   profile to a depth of up to 45 cm is a rather heavy-textured loamy soil
   changing into a light-textured sandy soil towards lower horizons. The
   measurement point proper is formed by two probes (novodur/PVC/casing)
   inserted to a depth of 110 cm. One probe is placed in a furrow after the
   planting machine and the second one between furrows in an intact soil
   profile. After calibration and determination of soil-moisture constants,
   recorded values of soil moisture were converted to reserve soil moisture
   (in mm) for profiles 0-40 cm and 0-100 cm. A comparison of resultant
   monthly values of reserve soil moisture in both measurement points by
   statistical methods revealed that at the place of a furrow after the
   planting machine there is a markedly more favourable dynamics of soil
   moisture as against the neighbouring intact terrain/soil. Moreover,
   surface runoff on the disturbed soil surface of skidding tracks,
   unfavourable with respect to potential erosion, was also eliminated. The

Abstract = {{Aim Compare contemporary with pre-fire-disruption forest structures,
   assessing the influence of factors that caused ecological change and
   evaluating remote sites as relatively natural areas.
   Location Grand Canyon National Park contains the largest never-harvested
   and long-term ungrazed forest ecosystem in Arizona, providing valuable
   sites for measuring natural variability. However, anthropogenic
   disruption of natural fire regimes since Euro-American settlement c.
   1880 has led to changes in forest structure.
   Methods We compared species composition, tree structure, regeneration,
   and canopy cover on large (135-603 ha) ponderosa pine-dominated study
   sites: (1) isolated points on the North Rim where some surface fires
   continued after 1880, (2) a higher-elevation North Rim site where fire
   has been excluded and (3) a South Rim site, also without recent fire,
   with a paired Kaibab National Forest site. Forest tree structure prior
   to fire-regime disruption was reconstructed with dendroecological
   techniques.
   Results Before fire exclusion, all sites had relatively low tree density
   (140-246 trees ha(-1)) dominated by large trees (basal area 9.1-28.5
   m(2) ha(-1)), primarily ponderosa pine or pine/Gambel oak on the South
   Rim. Currently all sites are relatively dense (389955 trees ha(-1),
   14.1-41.3 m(2) ha(-1)) but patterns of species composition and
   regeneration differed substantially with fire regime and elevation.
   Regeneration at continued-fire sites was primarily through sprouting
   species, Gambel oak and New Mexican locust, forming a shrubby midstorey
   under a relatively open pine canopy. In contrast, all fire-excluded
   sites were dense with seed-reproducing conifer species.
   Main conclusions Comparison of change caused by climate fluctuation,
   tree cutting, fire exclusion, livestock herbivory, and wildlife
   herbivory, suggests that fire regime alteration appears to have played
   the greatest role. The remote North Rim sites provide a close analogue
   to conditions prior to fire regime disruption, a contemporary example of
   the forest characteristics that might have been extant had recent
   human-caused disruption of disturbance regimes and heavy resource
   extraction not occurred. They merit broader study of natural variability
   on a range of ecological variables in ponderosa pine ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Landtype Associations (LTA's) represent one spatial-scale of a
   hierarchical ecological land classification system developed by the
   USDA-Forest Service for use in land management planning, analysis, and
   monitoring and evaluation. The system is described in, ``The National
   Hierarchical Framework of Ecological Units{''} (ECOMAP 1993). LTA's are
   the primary spatial-scale used in National Forest planning; information
   at this level also provides context for project-level activities and
   content for ecoregional assessments. Mappers in the Lake States have
   been refining LTA concepts and mapping to better reflect new
   understanding of landscape ecosystem concepts and spatial hierarchies.
   LTA's are landscape ecosystems, made up of clusters of interacting
   finer-scaled patches (Crow 1991). They have emergent properties which
   are not discernable by observing the function of an individual patch,
   but are apparent at the broader spatial-scale (Salt 1979). LTA's are
   conceptually identified based on differentiating criteria, and may be
   mapped by the ``top-down{''} method of regionalization (Rowe, 1962).
   Broader-scaled ecosystems are subdivided based on dominant physical
   factors that control or mediate biotic structure and function at this
   level. LTA boundaries may be based on climatic, physiographic, or
   hydrologic features that correspond with changes in vegetative
   composition or productivity. Often the precise boundary location is
   difficult to identify, as the dominant environmental factors may occur
   along a gradient. In cases where ecological boundaries are not discrete,
   they may be placed along physiographic boundaries or aligned with
   finer-scaled boundaries of soils or vegetation.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{240}},
Pages = {{49-56}},
Abstract = {{We tested the view that few generalizations are possible about the
   structure of subtidal algae assemblages and that the situation worsens
   or does not change as more sites are examined. We quantified the
   percentage cover of 4 morphological groups of benthic algae (encrusting
   and articulated coralline algae, and foliose and turfing algae) under
   canopies of kelp Ecklonia radiata and in areas without kelp (macroalgae
   >4 cm high). This was repeated over 4 spatial scales ranging from
   quadrats (separated by 10s of m), sites (separated by km), locations
   (separated by 100s of km) to regions (separated by 1000s of km) across
   the southern coastline of Australia: Western Australia (WA), Southern
   Australia (SA) and Eastern Australia (EA). The key result was that while
   comparison among sites revealed substantial and often inconsistent
   variation in abundance of benthic algae between habitats (kelp vs open),
   clear patterns emerged when locations and regions were compared. In EA,
   where grazers are effective in maintaining extensive areas of encrusting
   corallines, patterns of algal cover between habitats (kelp vs open) were
   generally reversed to WA and SA, where grazers are substantially less
   effective. These results indicate a large distinction in the ecology of
   these regions (WA = SA not equal EA) and how lack of understanding of
   this pattern at the regional scale tends to suggest overwhelming
   variation when single studies are compared among regions. These
   differences also highlight that comparisons of studies done at small
   scales, even if done at several sites in a locality, provide a difficult
   basis to understand the generality of pattern in algal assemblage
   structure due to large variation at this scale. While we acknowledge
   that these broad patterns were not possible to validate at the scale of
   sites, it was possible to increase the scale of observation to encompass
   broader patterns that might be organized around a relatively simple set
   of ecological predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Nest success, the proportion of clutches resulting in one or more
   fledglings, is a key indicator for assessing the effect of management on
   bird populations. However, the figures reported for New Zealand
   populations are usually ``apparent nest success{''}, the number of
   successful nests divided by the total number found. Apparent nest
   success invariably overestimates the true success rate, and the degree
   of bias depends on the population and monitoring regime. Consequently,
   apparent nest success rates cannot be reliably compared. We used
   Stanley's (2000) method for estimating stage-specific daily survival
   probabilities for New Zealand robin (Petroica australis) nests at
   Tiritiri Matangi, Paengaroa, Boundary Stream and Pureora. We show how
   Stanley's method can be used to eliminate biases, to calculate point
   estimates and confidence intervals for nest success, and to model the
   factors affecting nest success. At Pureora, where monitoring was
   extremely intensive, the apparent overall nest success (39\%) was close
   to that estimated from daily survival probabilities (37\%). Apparent
   nest success rates were extremely biased for the other populations due
   to less intensive monitoring, with the bias exacerbated by changes in
   survival probabilities with season and/or stage of the nesting cycle.
   Modelling the data showed that failure rates were: (1) higher early in
   the breeding season for at least some mainland populations, (2)
   different for incubation and nestling stages, with the pattern depending
   on the season (early or late) and type of predator, and (3)
   substantially lowered by predator control at Pureora, with the impact
   varying between sites and stages. Taking these factors into account, the
   estimated nest success (and 95\% confidence limits) was 60\% (4474) at
   Pureora after predator control, 47\% (23-73) at Boundary Stream, 37\%
   (26-49) at Tiritiri Matangi, 25\% (11 48) at Paengaroa, and 25\% (17-35)

   rubra), and silver tussock (Poa cita). At each locality, three
   treatments were established: ambient sheep+rabbit grazing, rabbit
   grazing only, and no grazing. The mutivariate methods of classification

   vegetation states and to examine transitions between them over time.
   Vegetation states in quadrats already dominated by Hieracium pilosella
   (> 50\% cover) in 1990 showed little change in species composition
   regardless of grassland type and grazing treatment. In fescue tussock
   grassland, H. pilosella increased regardless of grazing treatment in
   states with low initial H. pilosella cover(< 5\%), while the cover of
   Carex colensoi, Aira caryophyllea and Rumex acetosella decreased. In the
   single silver tussock locality, Poa cita decreased markedly in the
   ungrazed treatment as adventive species such as Dactylis glomerata and
   Echium vulgare increased. However, Poa cita also decreased, probably due
   to drought, in the grazed treatment. Snow tussock and red tussock
   grassland states were more stable than those in short tussock
   grasslands, but there was also a general trend towards increasing H.
   pilosella cover in intertussock vegetation regardless of treatment.
   However, at one snow tussock locality, transitions from H.
   pilosella-dominated to C. rigida-dominated states occurred in ungrazed
   quadrats, while the reverse occurred in grazed vegetation. Implications
   for the management of tussock grasslands for conservation are discussed.}},

   Hydrological Regime Assessment Method (DHRAM) has been developed. The
   underlying rationale is to assess the risk of significant impact on
   biota arising from changes in hydrological regime, as distinct from
   chemical or hydromorphological influences. This approach is based on the
   Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) methodology of Richter et al.
   (1996), in which the degree of alteration of a range of hydrological
   variables that are significant to biota are estimated. The DHRAM method
   classifies the degree of alteration to hydrological regime using a
   five-point scale, which correlates with the risk of ecological damage.
   These categories are compatible with those of the WFD. The acquisition
   of appropriate biological data for calibration and validation of DHRAM
   has, however, proved problematic. This paper proposes the future
   development of a calibration scheme which compares the biota of
   neighbouring water bodies (pairs whose physical attributes are as

Abstract = {{To understand the environmental problems of the 21st century, teams of
   researchers and partners must work together to build integrated tools to
   analyze and represent the known processes underway. Environmental
   problems are caused by complex interactions among physical and human
   systems that demand analytical skills beyond those of a single
   discipline. Integrated assessment and modeling (IAM) is applied at the
   global level (e.g., climate change models) and at the local/regional
   level (e.g., watershed models). The central role of human decisions and
   actions as drivers of environmental change is recognized in new IAM
   approaches. The chapter discusses various definitions of IAM and
   identifies five different types of integration that are needed for the
   effective solution of environmental problems. The future is then
   depicted in the form of two brief scenarios: one optimistic and one
   pessimistic. The evolution of IAM and its current state are then briefly
   reviewed and examples of recent case studies are identified. Integrated
   assessment is introduced as a means to respond to the need for better
   indicators of sustainability. The issues of complexity and validation
   are recognized as more complex than in traditional disciplinary
   approaches. Communication is identified as a central issue both
   internally among team members and externally with decisionmakers,
   stakeholders, and other scientists. Links with other research groups are
   recognized and points of shared interest identified. Finally, it is
   concluded that the process of integrated assessment and modeling is
   considered as important as the product for any particular project. By
   learning to work together and recognize the contribution of all team
   members and participants, it is believed that we will have a strong
   scientific and social basis to address the environmental problems of the
   21st century.}},

Abstract = {{This new numerical approach proposes a solution to a fundamental and
   difficult question in ecology, consisting of the correct geographical
   representation of multidimensional structures. Firstly, transformation
   was applied to the original matrix (n sites x q variables) in order to
   satisfy the condition of multinormality. Then, a hierarchical cluster
   analysis was used and cacti hierarchical level was Studied and
   characterised by a certain probability level. For each cut off level an
   algorithm based on the computation of the Bayesian probabilities
   produced a smaller matrix (n sites x c groups). These conditional
   probabilities measure the chance that each site has in belonging to a
   predefined group of sites. Spatial distributions of these probability
   values for each group of sites were mapped using kriging interpolation.
   Finally, the maps were used to define homogenous zones on a single map
   by superimposing one map on the other. The maximal value of interpolated
   probability was used as criterion to assign cacti point of the map to
   the zones predefined by this classification.
   This method was applied to map demersal fish habitats by using a dataset
   from bottom trawl surveys in the Bay of Biscay (France) during October
   1990. The boundaries between habitats were identified objectively. Then,
   the indicator species and species assemblages characterising the
   different habitats were identified by using an indicator value index.
   This index integrates the specificity and the fidelity quantities
   calculated for each species in each habitat. The obtained results showed
   that this method presented a robust tool to describe the habitat of
   exploited species. The obtained habitats were validated by their
   correspondence with depth strata, sediment type and also by the
   biological characteristics of the indicator species.
   The proposed method is useful in the study of temporal variations of
   habitats with regards to species assemblages and can also be generalised
   to other multivariate databases of different descriptors (physical,
   chemical, biological, etc.).}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{321-331}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Units of the National Park System are required to develop a general
   management plan that is consistent with visitor carrying capacities.
   Newer definitions of carrying capacities for protected areas, such as
   national parks and wilderness areas, are in terms of the acceptability
   of natural resource and human impacts as measured by selected
   biophysical resource and social conditions, rather than the number of
   visitors. Most methods for evaluating carrying capacity are
   non-quantitative and lack analytical rigor. Carrying capacity decisions
   are easier to justify when based on quantitative methods. This paper
   describes a carrying capacity modeling system that allows park managers
   to quantitatively determine whether the current state of a park's
   ecosystem is in compliance with established standards for carrying
   capacities and, in cases where it is not, to identify the management
   action having the greatest likelihood of bringing the ecosystem into
   compliance with those standards. The modeling system uses an ex post
   adaptive ecosystem management (AEM) model to determine whether the
   current state of an ecosystem complies with biophysical and social
   carrying capacities, and an ex ante multiple attribute scoring test of
   capacity (MASTEC) to identify the best management action for achieving
   compliance. The AEM model addresses potential errors that can occur when
   inferring an ecosystem's state from resource/social conditions. Errors
   occur when a manager decides that an ecosystem is in one state when in
   reality it is in another state. The consequences of such errors are
   greater when resource/social conditions are at the extremes. The AEM
   model minimizes the likelihood of such decision errors by using Bayes'
   rule to determine the state of an ecosystem. The MASTEC method allows a
   park manager to identify the best management action for bringing an
   incompliant ecosystem into compliance with carrying capacities. It
   integrates elements of two carrying capacity methods, Limits of
   Acceptable Change and Visitor Impact Management, and multiple attribute
   decision-making. The latter characterizes management actions in terms of
   their multiple biophysical and social attributes. The best management

Abstract = {{Spatially explicit identification of changes in ecological conditions
   over large areas is key to targeting and prioritizing areas for
   environmental protection and restoration by managers at watershed,
   basin, and regional scales, A critical limitation to this point has been
   the development of methods to conduct such broad-scale assessments.
   Field-based methods have proven to be too costly and too inconsistent in
   their application to make estimates of ecological conditions over large
   areas. New spatial data derived from satellite imagery and other
   sources, the development of statistical models relating landscape
   composition and pattern to ecological endpoints, and geographic
   information systems (GIs) make it possible to evaluate ecological
   conditions at multiple scales over broad geographic regions, In this
   study, we demonstrate the application of spatially distributed models
   for bird habitat quality and nitrogen yield to streams to assess the
   consequences of landcover change across the mid-Atlantic region between
   the 1970s and 1990s. Moreover, we present a way to evaluate spatial
   concordance between models related to different environmental endpoints.
   Results of this study should help environmental managers in the

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{1. Three experiments were performed, using laboratory mice (Mus
   musculus) as a model species, to evaluate the potential of using
   measurements of carbon isotope ratios in expired CO2 for tracing diets.
   2. Breath C-13 signatures of mice fed a constant diet (-21.4 parts per
   thousand +/- 0.35) reflected their diet, but were depleted by on average
   -5.7 parts per thousand. Body mass, sex and age were independent and
   significant factors correlated with the variability of C-13 enrichment
   in respired CO2.
   3. Breath C-13 signatures from starved mice (7 h) were lower than
   unstarved mice by 2.0 parts per thousand. Subsequently when starved mice
   were fed a small meal of a new diet, breath C-13 signatures approached
   those of the new diets within 15 min, returning to preingestion levels
   after 105 min.
   4. After a permanent diet switch C-13 values of breath were not
   asymptotic within 6 days, possibly because of use of fat reserves during
   the daytime carrying an isotopic memory of the previous diet. Hence,
   individual breath C-13 signatures may vary according to nutritive state
   and previous dietary history.
   5. Interindividual variability was measured at 3.3 parts per thousand.
   The implications are that large samples of individuals will be required
   to distinguish between diets of different populations where the isotopic
   difference between their diets was small - for example, that expected
   between herbivorous and carnivorous diets. However, breath would be
   suitable for distinguishing between dietary intakes of individuals for
   food types that are isotopically more distinct - such as between C-3 and
   C-4 plants.}},

Abstract = {{1. A new method (the iterative approach) is presented by which growth
   analyses can be conducted on plants that have been subjected to
   significant losses in biomass and leaf area between harvests. The method
   is particularly useful to analyse the effects of defoliation on growth

   2. Values for the following parameters can be estimated: absolute growth
   rate (g day(-1)), relative growth rate (RGR, g g(-1) day(-1)), net
   assimilation rate (NAR, g m(-2) day(-1)), leaf area ratio (LAR. m(2)
   g(-1)). fraction of newly assimilated mass that is allocated to leaf
   lamina production (f(lam), g g(-1)), and daily fractional change in the
   average specific leaf area of plants (rho, day(-1)). These parameters
   are determined by means of iterations. We defined a number of growth
   functions. and the values of NAR,f(lam) and the SLA of newly produced
   leaves were changed until these functions correctly predicted the
   measured total plant mass. leaf lamina mass and leaf area at the end of
   the growth period. This avoids having to assume a constant relationship
   between leaf area and biomass (as in the `classical' approach), and it
   avoids the use of polynomial functions to fit growth data (as in the
   `functional' approach) that are unsuitable for fitting data sets
   exhibiting discontinuities such as abrupt changes in biomass.
   3. The method was applied to a greenhouse experiment in which we
   analysed the effects of sustained defoliation on growth and biomass
   allocation in a tropical understorey palm, Chamaedorea elegans Mart.
   4. We showed that C elegans plants respond to defoliation with a
   considerable increase in the allocation of new assimilates to lamina

   associated reductions in LAR, they had RGR values that were similar to

Abstract = {{A new thermodynamic approach for the analysis of ecosystems is
   presented. Vegetation is regarded as an active surface, which is
   interacting with solar radiation. Absorption, refection and emission of
   radiation are consequences of this interaction, resulting in a new
   composition of the spectrum of outgoing radiation. From a macroscopic
   point of view this is equivalent to the change of energy and
   information. It is natural to assume that the difference between these
   macroscopic variables \{incoming and outgoing radiation) is not only
   defined by the properties of these radiation fluxes but also the
   properties (state) of the active surface (vegetation). Measuring the
   change of energy by the radiation balance and the increment of
   information by the Kullback measure we define a special function
   (exergy) as a function of these variables. We postulate the following
   minimax principle, which is a generalisation of Jorgensen's maximal
   principle: during the process of self-organisation the vegetation tends
   to maximise its exergy in respect to the increment of information and to
   minimise it in respect to the radiation balance. From this point of
   view, the functioning of vegetation may be interpreted as a work of some
   `thermodynamic machine', which can produce both mechanical work and
   information. This hypothesis was tested for seasonal dynamics of several
   ecosystems located at geographically different sites, where radiation
   data for two spectral intervals \{long-wave and short-wave) was
   available. It was shown that the minimax of exergy is attained in
   June-July near the maximum of photosynthesis. The comparison of these
   values for different ecosystems shows that more self-organised
   ecosystems \{like forests) are characterised by higher value of exergy

Abstract = {{The objective of the European Terrestrial Ecosystem Modelling Activity
   \{ETEMA) was to address some of the major challenges in developing
   generalized models to examine responses of natural and seminatural
   ecosystems to environmental change at the regional to European scale.
   The approach described herein was to break down the totality of
   ecosystem functioning into its key components, each with its
   characteristic spatial and temporal scales. A conceptual framework was
   developed describing the configuration of these components as modules
   within a generalized simulation model. The framework describes the key
   inputs, outputs and state variables, their spatial and temporal
   contexts, and information flows between modules. The `backbone' of the
   model is a system of nested timing loops corresponding to the disparate
   time scales at which different ecosystem processes occur. The framework
   is a theoretical construct into which ecosystem models at levels of
   complexity ranging from the very general to the highly detailed can be
   mapped, and thus provides a guide for development of models for novel,
   particularly regional-scale, applications. A number of subsystem studies
   of the major components of ecosystem functioning, i.e. modules of the
   conceptual framework, are briefly introduced herein. The general aim of
   the subsystem studies was to identify the key alternative formulations
   (as opposed to minor variants) and test these against observational
   data. The various subsystem studies concern planetary boundary
   layer-ecosystem interactions, ecosystem CO2 and H2O fluxes; vegetation
   physiology and phenology, biogeography and vegetation dynamics, detritus
   and SOM dynamics, soil moisture and human and natural disturbances and,
   as individual papers, they complete this special ETEMA issue.}},

Abstract = {{1 SOMKO is a new simulation model of soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics
   aimed at predicting long-term and short-term SOM dynamics based on a
   mechanistic approach focusing on microbes as the key agents of

   2 SOM is partitioned into cohorts and chemical quality pools (classified
   by age and chemical composition), the microbial community processes are
   explicitly represented, and the C : N stoichiometric constraints are
   accounted for through a new mechanism of offer and demand.
   3 The analysis of model equations shows that: (1) SOM C : N cannot
   decrease below microbial C : N; and (2) the nitrogen limitation of
   decomposition depends on SOM C : N, microbial biomass and soil mineral
   nitrogen. First tests of the: model show good qualitative behaviour for
   simulating the dynamics of short-term litter-bag type decomposition,
   longterm SOM increase, pulsed mineral nitrogen production, the priming
   effect due to easily decomposable carbon addition, and the effects of
   vegetation clearance and climate change on SOM. Simulations are in good
   agreement with long-term experimental data.
   4 SOMKO is an integrated component of the coupled soil-vegetation models

Abstract = {{Changing landowner demographics and the increasing recognition that some
   quantity of woody plants is valuable for certain rangeland management
   objectives has led to increasing interest in selective brush management
   practices. Brush Busters is a collaborative extension/research program
   developed in response to this growing interest. A survey of Texas County
   Extension Agents-Agriculture was conducted in 1999 to determine their
   perceptions about the interest in and adoption of Brush Busters
   practices. Using 3 threshold photographs, Extension Agents representing
   almost 50\% of the counties in the 9 Extension Districts surveyed
   estimated that 44, 34, and 49\% of the total area of mesquite, juniper
   and pricklypear, respectively, could be treated using Brush Busters.
   They also indicated that over 405,000 ha (78\% mesquite) were treated
   with Brush Busters methods between 1995 and 1998, but that this
   represented less than 7\% of the potentially treatable area. In most
   Extension Districts, more time was spent disseminating information about
   Brush Busters methods than any other brush management method since 1995.
   Extension Agents indicated that Brush Busters has become popular because
   it is perceived to be an inexpensive, convenient, safe, effective and
   predictable method for controlling brush, and because user-friendly
   information is widely available. Our findings suggest that increasing
   the adoption rates of ecologically sound rangeland management
   technologies requires: (1) greater emphasis on developing and
   disseminating user-friendly messages to rangeland managers and Extension
   Agents; and (2) greater emphasis on short-term efficacy rather than the
   long term advantages of new technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances are common phenomena that occurs in nature and

   This paper shows that despite considerable progress in the theory of

   different meanings. The differences follow from an alternative
   understanding of the term, assumption of the holistic or reductionistic
   concept of the study or different approaches to equilibrium and
   non-equilibrium in nature. Different theoretical and methodological
   assumptions taken when analysing vegetation changes under the effect of
   disturbances allow relative arbitrariness in the interpretation of
   results. However, not all biotic interactions and ecological processes
   taking place in plant communities can be identified as disturbances. The
   effects of disturbances should be described on the basis of an objective
   assessment of what is normal for the functioning and stabilisation of a
   community as well as what disturbs and disrupts this equilibrium.
   Moreover, assuming the equivalent treatment of ecological systems, the
   interaction of the disturbing factors should be related to a specific
   level of life organisation (an individual, population or community),
   which would permit unambiguous discernment of the disturbance effects
   and finally generalise its effects on different levels of the

Abstract = {{River-floodplain systems, and riparian forests in particular, offer
   physical contributions to human society such as flood mitigation and the
   maintenance of water quality, social benefits including the opportunity
   for recreation and solitude, as well as numerous ecological services.
   However, midwestern USA river landscapes have undergone much land-use
   change over time, such as widespread logging, the net loss of grasslands
   and wetlands, urbanization pressure, and increases in anthropogenic
   sedimentation. With its focus on spatial and temporal changes, landscape
   ecology is ideally suited to assess and quantify these riverlands
   modifications and it is currently used at the national, state, and
   sub-state level in efforts to restore or manage river and riparian
   landscapes, This two-part study explores the use of landscape ecology in
   smaller scale river conservation. First, we interviewed five
   locally-based, Midwestern non-profit conservation groups that were
   accomplishing significant river conservation and management work without
   intricate ecological plans. We found a tacit knowledge of fundamental
   landscape ecology concepts, and active interpretation to fit particular
   environmental situations. The groups were receptive to increased
   assistance from academic ecology, but the content must be clear,
   succinct, and easily integrated into frontline initiatives. To
   accomplish this goal, effort is needed from ecologists to construct new
   methods of delivering such information in an accessible and
   cost-effective manner. Second, we briefly explore land-use scenarios -
   based on realistic forest management agendas along the Wisconsin River
   (USA) - as one possible means of using applied science to assist local
   conservation efforts in prioritization of land parcels. Various land
   management scenarios to reinstate floodplain forest often produced

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aim The geographical distribution of 839 Andean passerine species was
   analysed using two biogeographical indices: environmental resistance
   (R-50) and anisotropy (A(50)). R-50 quantifies the loss of biotic
   resemblance occurring from any point in the map to the rest of the
   continent. A(50) quantifies the extent to which the perimeter : area
   ratio of the geographical ranges of all species whose distributions
   overlap at any particular location depart from the perimeter : area
   ratio of a circle. Three predictions derived from the climatic-tolerance
   hypothesis were tested: (1) the latitudinal Rapoport effect predicts an
   increase in the range-sizes of species, and hence a decrease in the
   values of R-50, towards the south; (2) Janzen's argument that `mountain
   passes are higher in the tropics' predicts greater anisotropy in the
   tropics; (3) because environmental conditions are relatively constant
   across the tropics, and begin to change at the boundaries, this predicts
   high spatial turnover - and hence rapid change of R-50 values - at the
   limits of the tropics.
   Location The Andes, in South America.
   Methods The geographical ranges of 839 passerine species were drawn on a
   standardized grid map of the Andean region. The presence-absence (1-0)
   of each species in each of the 150 cells in the grid map was recorded.
   These data were used to create equiprobabilistic maps, which then were
   used to estimate a value of R-50 and A(50) for each cell in the grid map
   (sensu Rapoport, 1975, 1979, 1982).
   Results The spatial patterns in R-50 and A(50) offer partial support to
   the original predictions. The tendency for R-50 data to decrease with
   latitude (Rapoport effect) vanishes after controlling for differences in
   species richness among latitudes compared. In contrast, A(50) data
   clearly offer indirect support to Janzen's prediction of narrower
   climatic tolerances of species around the tropics, even after
   controlling for differences in species richness. The Andean passerine
   species confirm that spatial turnover of species exists at the southern
   edge of the tropics, and also at different latitudes within the tropics,
   Main conclusions The analysis suggests that it is the major structural
   change in the topography of mountains - and not merely latitude - that
   ultimately governs the spatial variation in size and shape of species
   ranges along the Andes.}},

Abstract = {{When the objective is to characterize landscapes with respect to
   relative degree and type of forest (or other critical habitat)
   fragmentation, it is difficult to decide which variables to measure and
   what type of discriminatory analysis to apply. It is also desirable to
   incorporate multiple measurement scales. In response, a new method has
   been developed that responds to changes in both the marginal and spatial
   distributions of land cover in a raster map. Multiscale features of the
   map are captured in a sequence of successively coarsened resolutions
   based on the random filter for degrading raster map resolutions.
   Basically, the entropy of spatial pattern associated with a particular
   pixel resolution is calculated, conditional on the pattern of the next
   coarser `parent' resolution. When the entropy is plotted as a function
   of changing resolution, we obtain a simple two-dimensional graph called
   a `conditional entropy profile', thus providing a graphical
   visualization of multi-scale fragmentation patterns.
   Using eight-category raster maps derived from 30-meter resolution
   LANDSAT Thematic Mapper images, the conditional entropy profile was
   obtained for each of 102 watersheds covering the state of Pennsylvania
   (USA). A suite of more conventional single-resolution landscape
   measurements was also obtained for each watershed using the FRAGSTATS
   program. After dividing the watersheds into three major physiographic
   provinces, cluster analysis was performed within each province using
   various combinations of the FRAGSTATS variables, land cover proportions
   and variables describing the conditional entropy profiles. Measurements

Abstract = {{Over the past 50 years, local residents and hunters have perceived
   regional declines of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the
   Adirondack Park of northern New York. However, deer in the
   2.5-million-ha park historically have been managed as a single
   population, despite the possibility that they may have been responding
   to different environmental pressures. We identified spatial patterns in
   harvest of white-tailed deer and characterized how these patterns
   changed from 1954 through 1997. We investigated the potential influence
   of winter severity and antlerless harvests on spatial distribution of
   deer harvest. We averaged records of annual antlered male harvest/ha by
   township over each decade. Using kriging, a geostatistical method of
   interpolation, we modeled patterns of spatial autocorrelation in these
   data and created contour maps of antlered harvest/ha across the park. We
   observed parkwide decline in antlered harvest/ha following a series of 3
   severe winters during 1968-1971. By the 1980s, antlered harvest in most
   regions had recovered, except for the western-central regions of the
   park. Examination of 1 year of private hunting-club records, which
   allowed correction for hunter effort, displayed spatial patterns similar
   to that of state antlered harvest/ha data, indicating that our results
   were not an artifact of varying hunter effort across the park. Winter
   severity differed among 5 geographic regions of the park (P <0.001).
   Failure of the western-central region to recover may reflect the
   combined effects of frequent severe winters and large antlerless
   harvests during the 1950s and 1960s.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new approach to modeling population structure for
   genes under strong balancing selection of the type seen in plant
   self-incompatibility systems and the major histocompatibility complex
   (MHC) system of vertebrates. Simple analytic solutions for the number of
   alleles maintained at equilibrium and the expected proportion of alleles
   shared between demes at various levels are derived and checked against
   simulation results. The theory accurately captures the dynamics of
   allele number in a subdivided population and identifies important values
   of m (migration bate) at which allele number and distribution change
   qualitatively. Starting from a panmictic population, as migration among
   demes decreases a qualitative change in dynamics is seen at
   approximately m(crit) approximate to (s/4 piN(T))(1/2), where N-T is the
   total population size and s is a measure of the strength of selection.
   At this point, demes can no longer maintain their panmictic allele
   number, due to increasing isolation from the total population. Another
   qualitative change occurs at a migration rate on the same order of
   magnitude as the mutation rate. u. At this point, the demes are highly
   differentiated for allele complement. and the total number of alleles in
   the population is increased. Because in general u much less than
   m(crit), at intermediate migration rates slightly fewer alleles may be
   maintained in the total population than are maintained at panmixia.
   Within this range, total allele number may not be the best indicator of
   whether a population is effectively panmictic, and some caution should
   be used when interpreting samples from such populations. The theory
   presented here can help to analyze data from genes under balancing
   selection in subdivided populations.}},

Abstract = {{Regional conservation plans are developed and implemented to protect
   areas from human land uses that adversely affect biological diversity.
   Several different criteria have been used to identify locations with
   high biodiversity value; among these is ``wildness.{''} We evaluated the
   extent of wildness of the Upper Great Lakes region of the United States
   (the ``Northwoods{''}) to identify areas for inclusion in a regional
   conservation plan. Using a geographic information system to organize
   data, we evaluated wildness using six different data layers in raster
   format: land cover classification, forest cover type, land ownership,
   human population density, road density, and wolf (Canis lupus L.)
   habitat suitability. For each data layer, we quantified wildness (more
   vs, less wild) based on threshold criteria. We classified pixels within
   data layers as more wild if: (1) forest is present, (2) the forest has
   has the same general species composition since European settlement, (3)
   the area is in public ownership, (4) human population density is < 1
   person per km(2), (5) road density is < 0.5 km of road per km(2), and
   (6) the probability that wolves would colonize the area exceeds 75\%. We
   found all these measures of wildness to be significantly associated with
   each other based on chi-square tests of independence (adjusted P <<
   0.001). We created a new data layer by combining five existing layers
   (all except the wolf colonization Layer) using an overlay procedure.
   This new layer shows a gradient of wildness across the region, with only
   5.7\% of all pixels meeting all five wildness criteria. The probability
   of wolves colonizing an area increases with its wildness. The methods we
   use to evaluate wildness here can be used in conjunction with other
   methods of regional biodiversity assessment to guide acquisition and
   easement efforts, zoning policies, and land management activities as

Abstract = {{Time series data from high resolution satellite imagery provide
   researchers with an opportunity to develop sophisticated statistical
   models of land-cover change. As inputs to statistical models, land-cover
   change data that are generated from satellite imagery must be both
   accurate and unbiased. This paper describes a new change detection
   method to determine the date of land-cover change in a sequential series
   of Landsat TM images of the Pearl River Delta, China. The method is a
   three-step change detection procedure that uses time series and panel
   econometric techniques. In the first step, regression equations are
   estimated for each of the six DN bands for each of seven stable
   land-cover classes. In the second step, the regression equations for
   each class are used to calculate DN values for change land-cover classes
   for each of the eight possible dates of change (1989-1996). In the third
   step, the date of land-cover change is identified by comparing a pixel's
   DN values against the eight possible dates of change using tests for
   predictive accuracy. The accuracy and bias of the dates of change
   identified by the econometric technique compare favorably to a more
   conventional change detection technique. Furthermore, the econometric
   technique may reduce efforts required to assemble the training data and
   to correct the images for atmospheric effects. Together, these results
   indicate that is possible to generate land-use change estimates from a

Abstract = {{The fluctuations exhibited by natural populations have fascinated

Abstract = {{In order to understand and moderate the effects of the accelerating rate
   of global environmental change land managers and ecologists must not
   only think beyond their local environment but also put their problems
   into a historical context. It is intuitively obvious that historians
   should be natural allies of ecologists and land managers as they
   struggle to maintain biodiversity and landscape health. Indeed,
   `environmental history' is an emerging field where the previously
   disparate intellectual traditions of ecology and history intersect to
   create a new and fundamentally interdisciplinary field of inquiry.
   Environmental history is rapidly becoming an important field displacing
   many older environmentally focused academic disciplines as well as
   capturing the public imagination.
   By drawing on Australian experience I explore the role of `environmental
   history' in managing biodiversity. First I consider some of the
   similarities and differences of the ecological and historical approaches
   to the history of the environment. Then I review two central questions
   in Australian environment history: landscape-scale changes in woody
   vegetation cover since European settlement and the extinction of the
   marsupials in both historical and pre-historical time. These case
   studies demonstrate that environmental historians can reach conflicting
   interpretations despite using essentially the same data.
   The popular success of some environmental histories hinges on the fact
   that they narrate a compelling story concerning human relationships and
   human value judgements about landscape change. Ecologists must learn to
   harness the power of environmental history narratives to bolster land
   management practices designed to conserve biological heritage. They can
   do this by using various currently popular environmental histories as a
   point of departure for future research, for instance by testing the
   veracity of competing interpretations of landscape-scale change in woody
   vegetation cover. They also need to learn how to write parables that
   communicate their research findings to land managers and the general
   public. However, no matter how sociologically or psychologically
   satisfying a particular environmental historical narrative might be, it
   must be willing to be superseded with new stories that incorporate the
   latest research discoveries and that reflects changing social values of
   nature. It is contrary to a rational and publicly acceptable approach to
   land management to read a particular story as revealing the absolute
   truth.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing fragmentation of natural areas and a dramatic reduction
   of forest cover in several parts of the world, quantifying the impact of
   such changes on species richness and community dynamics has been a
   subject of much concern. Here, we tested whether in more fragmented
   landscapes there was a lower number of area-sensitive species and higher
   local extinction and turnover rates, which could explain higher temporal
   variability in species richness. To investigate such potential landscape
   effects at a regional scale, we merged two independent, large-scale
   monitoring efforts: the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and
   the Land Use and Land Cover Classification data from the U.S. Geological
   Survey.
   We used methods that accounted for heterogeneity in the probability of
   detecting species to estimate species richness and temporal changes in
   the bird communities for BBS routes in three mid-Atlantic U.S. states.
   Forest breeding bird species were grouped prior to the analyses into
   area-sensitive and non-area-sensitive species according to previous
   studies. We tested predictions relating measures of forest structure at
   one point in time (1974) to species richness at that time and to
   parameters of forest bird community change over the following
   22-yr-period (1975-1996). We used the mean size of forest patches to
   characterize landscape structure, as high correlations among landscape
   Variables did not allow us to disentangle the relative roles of habitat
   fragmentation per se and habitat loss.
   As predicted, together with lower species richness for area-sensitive
   species on routes surrounded by landscapes with lower mean forest-patch
   size, we found higher mean year-to-year rates of local extinction.
   Moreover, the mean year-to-year rates of local turnover (proportion of
   locally new species) for area-sensitive species were also higher in
   landscapes with lower mean forest-patch size. These associations were
   not observed for the non-area-sensitive species group.
   These results suggest that landscape structure may influence forest bird
   communities at regional scales through its effects on the total number
   of species but also on the temporal rates of change in community
   composition. Evidence for higher rates of local extinction and turnover
   in more fragmented landscapes suggests that bird communities function as
   metapopulations at a regional scale, and points out the importance of
   colonizations and recolonizations from surrounding landscapes to local
   community dynamics. Further, our results illustrate that the methods
   used to estimate the community parameters can be a powerful statistical
   tool in addressing questions relative to the dynamics of communities.}},

Abstract = {{An estimate of live tree carbon stored in New Zealand forests at 1990
   was made to partially satisfy New Zealand's international obligations
   under the Framework Convention for Climate Change. A national database
   was compiled of 4956 forest inventory plots measured as recently as
   possible to 1990. Plot biomass estimates were obtained by applying
   species allometric relationships derived from harvested stands. Forest
   areas and classes were taken from a 1987 national map of vegetation
   cover. Regularly spaced grids, based on an initial 1 km x 1 km grid,
   were overlaid on the total forest area and plots were tested for bias
   against site characteristics at the grid points. As grid point density
   and sample size increased, bias was minimal in regional sampling
   intensity and in total annual precipitation. Differences in mean
   elevation and annual temperature remained stable as grid point density
   increased, and showed little correlation with stem biomass. This
   sampling method gave a measure of precision not available from previous
   estimates.
   An efficient sample size to estimate the mean within a 5\% level of
   precision (at 95\% probability) required a sample of 574 plots selected
   from a 4-km grid. This strategy generated a mean estimate for the 1990
   New Zealand forest carbon biomass of 179.3 +/- 4.9 Mg ha(-1) (+/- SE),
   totalling 919.1 +/- 25.1 Mt for the 5.1 million ha mapped forest area.
   The mean was 6-10\% lower than previous estimates, and was within the
   range reported for other countries. Within forest classes, mean carbon
   biomass ranged from 105 Mg ha(-1) in pure podocarp forest to 215 Mg ha-l
   in mixed lowland podocarp-broad-leaved-beech forest. Of the major taxa

Abstract = {{Assessing and managing the ecological risks from multiple stressors is
   becoming increasingly important as our environmental and regulatory
   focus moves from managing point sources to one of managing and trading
   risks from multiples sources over large geographic areas. There are
   important corollaries to this shift in focus and scale, one is the
   increased role and importance of non-chemical stressors in shaping and
   controlling ecological systems, the fact that these categories of stress
   are, for the most part, not regulated under the traditional legislative
   mandates, that we have limited knowledge regarding the interaction of
   chemical and non-chemical stressors, that at large scales we are faced
   with the integration of and trading of risks to multiple resource
   categories. This trend of increased attention to regional-scale
   environmental issues requires the development of new analysis and
   interpretive strategies and highlight the need for a systematic
   framework for addressing the ecological effects of multiple stressors at
   regional ecological scales. We propose that such a framework have three
   essential properties: it be risk-based; it be effects driven; and it
   have the flexibility to be used in both a retrospective and prospective
   manner. While several approaches have been proposed we believe that an
   ecological risk assessment framework satisfies these criteria, has been
   used successfully in regional assessments, and can readily be modified
   and adapted to serve a wide variety of problem settings.}},

Abstract = {{As the density of development increases, there is a growing need to
   address the cumulative effects of project developments on the
   environment. In Canada this need has been recognized in legislation
   whereby new project developments that require an environmental
   assessment under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act are required
   to address the cumulative effects of proposed project activities
   relative to the existing environmental condition. Unfortunately,
   existing stressor-based and effects-based approaches to environmental
   assessment do not adequately address cumulative effects as defined under
   the Act when used in isolation. However, elements from each approach can
   be conceptually incorporated into a holistic cumulative effects
   assessment framework. Key framework components include: (1) an
   effects-based assessment to determine existing accumulated environmental
   state, (2) a stressor-based assessment to predict potential impacts of
   new development relative to the existing environmental state, (3)
   post-development monitoring to assess the accuracy of impact predictions
   and to provide an avenue for adaptive management, and (4)
   decision-making frameworks to link scientific information to public

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{458-471}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Many species are adversely affected by human activities at large
   spatial scales and their conservation requires detailed information on
   distributions. Intensive ground surveys cannot keep pace with the rate
   of land-use change over large areas and new methods are needed for
   regional-scale mapping.
   2. We present predictive models for great bustards in central Spain
   based on readily available advanced very high resolution radiometer
   (AVHRR) satellite imagery combined with mapped features in the form of
   geographic information system (GIS) data layers. As AVHRR imagery is
   coarse-grained, we used a 12-month time series to improve the definition
   of habitat types. The GIS data comprised measures of proximity to
   features likely to cause disturbance and a digital terrain model to
   allow for preference for certain topographies
   3. We used logistic regression to model the above data, including an
   autologistic term to account for spatial autocorrelation. The results
   from models were combined using Bayesian integration, and model
   performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristics plots.
   4. Sites occupied by bustards had significantly lower densities of
   roads, buildings, railways and rivers than randomly selected survey
   points. Bustards also occurred within a narrower range of elevations and
   at locations with significantly less variable terrain.
   5. Logistic regression analysis showed that roads, buildings, rivers and
   terrain all contributed significantly to the difference between occupied
   and random sites. The Bayesian integrated probability model showed an
   excellent agreement with the original census data and predicted suitable
   areas not presently occupied.
   6. The great bustard's distribution is highly fragmented and vacant
   habitat patches may occur for a variety of reasons, including the
   species' very strong fidelity to traditional sites through conspecific
   attraction. This may limit recolonization of previously occupied sites.
   7. We conclude that AVHRR satellite imagery and GIS data sets have
   potential to map distributions at large spatial scales and could be
   applied to other species. While models based on imagery alone can
   provide accurate predictions of bustard habitats at some spatial scales,
   terrain and human influence are also significant predictors and are
   needed for finer scale modelling.}},

Journal = {{MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{173-194}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A major challenge in microbial ecology is to develop reliable and facile
   methods of computer-assisted microscopy that can analyze digital images
   of complex microbial communities at single cell resolution, and compute
   useful quantitative characteristics of their organization and structure
   without cultivation. Here we describe a computer-aided interactive
   system to analyze the high degree of morphological diversity in growing
   microbial communities revealed by phase-contrast microscopy. The system,
   called ``CMEIAS{''} (Center for Microbial Ecology Image Analysis System)
   consists of several custom plug-ins for UTHSCSA ImageTool, a free
   downloadable image analysis program operating on a personal computer in
   a Windows NT environment. CMEIAS uses various measurement features and
   two object classifiers to extract size and shape measurements of
   segmented, digital images of microorganisms and classify them into their
   appropriate morphotype. The first object classifier uses a single
   measurement feature to analyze relatively simple communities containing
   only a few morphotypes (e.g., regular rods, cocci, filaments). A second
   new hierarchical tree classifier uses an optimized subset of multiple
   measurement features to analyze significantly more complex communities
   containing greater morphological diversity than ever before possible.
   This CMEIAS shape classifier automatically categorizes each cell into
   one of 11 predominant bacterial morphotypes, including cocci, spirals,
   curved rods, U-shaped rods, regular straight rods, unbranched filaments,
   ellipsoids, clubs, rods with extended prostheca, rudimentary branched
   rods, and branched filaments. The training and testing images for
   development and evaluation of the CMEIAS classifier were obtained from
   1,937 phase-contrast grayscale digital images of various diverse
   communities. The CMEIAS shape classifier had an accuracy of 96.0\% on a
   training set of 1,471 cells and 97.0\% on a test set of 4,270 cells
   representing all 11 bacterial morphotype classes, indicating that
   accurate classification of rich morphological diversity in microbial
   communities is now possible. An interactive edit feature was added to
   address the main sources of error in automatic shape classification,
   enabling the operator to inspect the assigned morphotype of each
   bacterium based on visual recognition of its distinctive pseudocolor,
   reassign it to another morphotype class if necessary, and add up to five
   other morphotypes to the classification scheme. The shape classifier
   reports on the number and types of different morphotypes present and the
   abundance among each of them, thus providing the data needed to compute
   the morphological diversity within the microbial community. An example
   of how CMEIAS can augment the analysis of microbial community structure
   is illustrated by studies of morphological diversity as an indicator of
   dynamic ecological succession following a nutrient shift-up perturbation
   in two continuously fed, anaerobic bioreactors with morphologically
   distinct start communities. Various steps to minimize the limitations of
   computer-assisted microscopy to classify bacterial morphotypes using
   CMEIAS are described. In summary, CMEIAS is an accurate, robust,
   flexible semiautomatic computing tool that can significantly enhance the
   ability to quantitate bacterial morphotype diversity and should serve as
   a useful adjunct to the analysis of microbial community structure. This
   first version of CMEIAS will be released as free, downloadable plug-ins
   so it can provide wide application in studies of microbial ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Individual-based models (IBMs) have long been proposed as a key tool for
   understanding and predicting ecosystem complexities, yet the
   contribution of this approach to basic or applied ecology has been less
   than anticipated. Fundamental reasons for the disappointing contribution
   of IBMs have been, in the current absence of a theoretical foundation
   for IBMs, conceptual flaws in model formulation and the failure to
   address critical computer implementation issues. Researchers in the new
   field of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) study how complex behaviors
   emerge in systems of relatively simple interacting individuals. Research
   on GAS, while still new and informal, has identified key concepts for
   making individual-based systems realistic. I propose that explicit
   consideration of the following concepts from CAS should make the design
   of IBMs less ad hoc and more likely to produce models of value for basic
   and applied ecology: (1) Emergence: what behaviors and population
   dynamics should emerge from the model's mechanistic representation of
   key processes vs. being imposed on the model as empirical relations? How
   should individual traits be modeled so that realistic population
   responses emerge?; (2) Adaptation: given the model's temporal and
   spatial scales, what adaptive processes of individuals should be
   modeled? What mechanisms do individuals use to adapt in response to what
   environmental forces?; (3) Fitness and strategy: what measures of
   fitness are appropriate to use as the basis for modelling decision
   making? Should fitness measures change with life history state?; (4)
   State-based responses: how should decision processes depend on an
   individual's state?; (5) Prediction: anticipating decision outcomes
   appears essential for modelling many behaviors; what are realistic
   assumptions about how organisms predict the consequences of decisions?;
   (6) Computer implementation: what user interfaces are necessary to make
   the model, and especially individual behaviors, observable and testable?
   How will the model's full design and computer implementation be
   documented and tested so results are reproducible and valid? (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Fish were collected from the intake screens of the Oldbury Power Station
   in the Severn Estuary in each week between early July 1972 and late June
   1977 and at least twice monthly between early January 1996 and late June
   1999. The annual catches, after adjustment to a common sampling effort,
   demonstrate that the abundance of fish at Oldbury was far greater in the
   1990s than 1970s, mainly due to marked increases in the numbers of
   certain marine species, such as sand goby, whiting, bass, thin-lipped
   grey mullet, herring, sprat and Norway pout. These increases may reflect
   the great improvement that occurred in the water quality of the Severn
   Estuary between these decades. The only species that declined markedly
   in abundance was poor cod. Modest declines in flounder and River lamprey
   paralleled those occurring elsewhere in the UK. The species composition
   in the two decades also differed, reflecting changes not only in the
   relative abundances of the various marine estuarine-opportunistic
   species, which dominated the ichthyofauna, but also in those of the
   suite of less abundant species in the estuary. The cyclical changes
   undergone each year by the species composition of the fish fauna of the
   Severn Estuary reflect sequential intra-annual changes in the relative
   abundances of species representing each of the marine, diadromous and
   freshwater categories. New approaches have been developed to test
   whether or not large sets of correlations between patterns of
   recruitment amongst abundant marine species (internal correlations), and
   between those patterns and salinity and water temperature within the
   estuary (cross-correlations), were significant. The correlation profile
   analyses found no evidence that the annual recruitment strengths of
   these species were either intercorrelated, or correlated with either one
   or a combination of both of the above environmental variables. Yet, the
   timings of the recruitment of these species into the estuary were
   intercorrelated, i.e. a slightly earlier or later than normal
   immigration by one species in a given year was paralleled by the same
   trend in other species. However, this association in recruitment times
   could be linked neither to salinity nor water temperature within the
   estuary, nor to a combination of these two variables. These results
   indicate that, while the factors that influence the annual recruitment
   strengths of the juveniles of different marine species vary,
   inter-annual differences in the phasing of events that regulate spawning
   times and/or larval dispersal influence, in the same direction, the
   times when marine species are recruited into the estuary. (C) 2001

Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{To determine how grassland, woodland, and bordering forests respond to
   increased aridity, we used paleoecological methods to examine past
   responses along a transect of three sites at the eastern boundary of the
   Northern Plains of North America. Our study region corresponds to the
   confluence of three air streams that control central North American
   climates and, hence, should be sensitive to climate change. Sediment
   cores were analyzed for evidence of Holocene vegetation and fire from
   tall-grass prairie in eastern North Dakota (Moon Lake), from mixed
   forest near the prairie border in northwestern Minnesota (Deming Lake),
   and from mixed forest more remote from prairie in western Wisconsin
   (Dark Lake). Together with pollen and charcoal analysis, we present a
   new method for determining delta C-13 of terrestrial (charred) organic
   matter and, thus, the relative importance of C-3 and C-4 photosynthetic
   pathways in past vegetation. Paleorecords were supplemented with surface
   charcoal accumulation and delta C-13 from 21 North American lakes that
   span boreal, deciduous, pine, and mixed forest to tall- and mixed-grass
   prairie.
   Surface charcoal and delta C-13 follow vegetation and climate gradients,
   with high charcoal accumulation and delta C-13 (-20 parts per thousand)
   in the Plains (Dakotas, Nebraska, and southwest Minnesota) and decreases
   to the east, west, and north. The delta C-13 pattern is consistent with
   observed patterns of C-3:C-4 dominance across the region. Sediment,
   pollen, charcoal, and terrestrial delta C-13 show that vegetation
   response to climate change varied substantially among tall-grass
   prairie, bordering woodland, and forest. During maximum aridity
   (8000-4000 yr BP) prairie vegetation in eastern North Dakota showed a
   demise of woody vegetation followed by a dfluctuating dominance of
   grasses (40\% C-4) and forbs. Meanwhile, prairie expanded eastward into
   northwestern Minnesota, where it produced a shifting dominance between
   mostly C-4 grasses and woody vegetation until more humid conditions and
   mixed forest developed after 4000 yr BP Mixed forest in southwestern
   Wisconsin showed little response to mid-Holocene aridity. Elevated delta
   C-13 values from 5000 to 3000 yr BP suggest that composition of grasses
   changed (to increased C-4), although pollen data indicate that the total
   abundance of grasses remained constant. The increase in C-4 grasses at
   this time is consistent with previous studies suggesting a delayed dry
   interval in eastern Iowa. Reduced aridity of the last 2000 yr brought
   increased fire to tall-grass prairie as higher primary productivity led
   to increased fuel load. Meanwhile, forest expanded in northwestern
   Minnesota, leading to decreased ignition and fine fuels, in turn
   resulting in decreased fire at the woodland margin.}},

Abstract = {{Erwin's method for estimating total global species richness assumes some
   host-specificity among the canopy arthropods. This study examined
   possible host habitat specialization in two major groups of soil
   arthropods, the oribatid and mesostigmatid mites, by sampling beneath
   three tree species: Eucalyptus pilularis Smith, Eucalyptus propinqua
   Deane and Maiden and Allocasuarina torulosa (Aiton) L. Johnson. The
   sample sites were in the Lansdowne State Forest, New South Wales,
   Australia and the three tree species were selected on the basis of their
   known differential effects on soil. Sampling was conducted over three
   seasons, and 79 oribatid and 34 mesostigmatid species were identified
   from 25 196 and 3634 individuals, respectively. Tree species had little
   effect on mite species composition with only three oribatid species and
   no mesostigmatid species identified as host-habitat specialists using a
   niche breadth measure. Of mite species found under E. pilularis, E.
   propinqua and A. torulosa trees, 2\%, 1\% and 0\% were defined as
   host-habitat specialists, respectively. In contrast, tree species had
   significant and consistent effects on mite community structure, which
   differed in relative abundance of the oribatid species, their size class
   distributions and species rankings. In the mesostigmatid communities,
   there was a difference in the ranking of the mite species among tree
   species. Although it was demonstrated that tree species have an impact
   on the soil environment, the differences between tree species were
   insufficient to change species composition. The low degree of
   host-habitat specialization suggested that other factors were more
   important for determining mite species composition at a site, and soil
   mite host-habitat specialization may not make a large contribution to
   estimates of total global species richness using methods such as those
   proposed by Erwin (1982).}},

Abstract = {{Sea birds play a major role in marine food webs, and it is important to
   determine when and how much they feed at sea. A major advance has been
   made by using the drop in stomach temperature after ingestion of
   ectothermic prey. This method is less sensitive when birds eat small
   prey or when the stomach is full. Moreover, in diving birds,
   independently of food ingestion, there are fluctuations in the lower
   abdominal temperature during the dives. Using oesophageal temperature,
   we present here a new method for detecting the timing of prey ingestion
   in free-ranging sea birds, and, to our knowledge, report the first data
   obtained on king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus). In birds ashore,
   which were hand-fed 2-15 g pieces of fish, all meal ingestions were
   detected with a sensor in the upper oesophagus. Detection was poorer
   with sensors at increasing distances from the beak. At sea, slow
   temperature drops in the upper oesophagus and stomach characterized a
   diving effect per se. For the upper oesophagus only, abrupt temperature
   variations were superimposed, therefore indicating prey ingestions. We
   determined the depths at which these occurred. Combining the changes in
   oesophageal temperatures of marine predators with their diving pattern
   opens new perspectives for understanding their foraging strategy, and,
   after validation with concurrent applications of classical techniques of
   prey survey, for assessing the distribution of their prey.}},

Abstract = {{I review what biologists now think we know about caribou dynamics
   (Rangifer tarandus) and how we came by this knowledge, in the hope that
   there are some lessons that will help us learn more efficiently in the
   future. Prior to the late 1940s, most knowledge about caribou was
   obtained from anecdotal accounts of explorers, miners, government
   officials, and from the traditional knowledge of Native peoples. From
   the late 1940s to the early 1960s, there was a great leap forward due to
   the use of modem aircraft for wildlife surveys, the establishment of the
   wildlife management program at the University of Alaska, wolf (Canis
   lupus) control, and the increased availability of funding for wildlife
   research in Canada and Alaska. During the 1960s, particularly in Alaska,
   accumulation of knowledge slowed because of the change in administration
   from federal to state management, a shift in management and research
   priorities from caribou to moose (Alces alces), decreased funding and
   personnel for wildlife management, and because caribou were abundant
   throughout Alaska. Caribou were still viewed as a rather
   ``unmanageable{''} species because of misunderstandings about population
   identity, population limitation and regulation, and caribou movements.
   Major declines in populations during the early 1970s, development of
   reliable radio collars, and much greater availability of affordable
   helicopters led to a renaissance in caribou research during the late
   1970s. During the mid to late 1980s, new information accrued more slowly
   while most herds were increasing again. Widespread declines of caribou
   in the early 1990s, in conjunction with ongoing long-term research on
   population dynamics, weather, and predation, provided a large amount of
   new information. Knowledge about caribou dynamics, like the advancement
   of science, in general, has not come in a gradual way. There have been
   periods of stagnation when caribou populations were high, interspersed
   with periods of confusion, and then rapidly expanded research as herds
   declined. Despite greatly expanded knowledge, managers still have a
   limited ability to control caribou numbers, and the primary function of
   managers will continue to be providing for caribou hunting, while
   ensuring that hunting does not cause herds to decline to undesirably low
   levels. An increasingly important function for managers is providing
   accurate information to the public about caribou dynamics and the
   rationale for hunting regulations. Caribou biologists and managers
   should not be defensive or embarrassed about being wrong when new
   information casts doubt on old ideas, and creative new approaches to
   learning should be encouraged.}},

Abstract = {{Human activities, such as logging, modify the forest structure and the

   work were to evaluate changes in the diversity and relative abundance of
   birds and to analyze their trophic relationships with insect and plant
   communities along the Nothofagus pumilio forest management cycle. Data
   was collected using a point sampling method along transects located in
   different forest structures during the summer season, by direct (sight)
   and indirect (hearing) recognition following sunrise. Bird diversity and
   abundance significantly varied along the forest management cycle. Seven
   new species appeared after harvest, but the total number did not vary by
   the end of the forest management cycle, and there was no significant
   loss of species. Bird abundance was directly related to the insect
   abundance and plant biomass. Relationship between groups (lower plants,
   monocotyledons and dicotyledonous) is also discussed. Major studies in
   bird ecology are necessary to develop new silvicultural alternatives
   based on the more sensitive species to harvest. Forest management
   strategies and mitigation alternatives must be incorporated into forest

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-67}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aim To test whether a geologically recent region with low endemism shows
   low genetic diversity in a freshwater fish species complex, in contrast
   to an adjacent area with high diversity. The low endemism is generally
   postulated to be the combined effect of Pleistocene glaciations and the
   unstable nature of the recent gravel outwash from young mountains to the
   west. This rock aggradation has formed a plain, crossed by several
   braided rivers. The faunas of these rivers have the potential to
   interchange through flooding or course changes.
   Location Southern and central South Island, New Zealand (NZ). We define
   the boundary of these two biogeographical regions as the Waitaki River,
   the most southerly braided river. To the north lies the Canterbury
   Plain, formed from coalesced alluvial fans; to the south is the Otago
   peneplain and associated mountain ranges.
   Methods Previous work has revealed considerable genetic structuring in
   the stream-resident fish Galaxias vulgaris Stokell sensu lato, including
   a species complex in the southern region of South Island, NZ. Using
   isozyme electrophoresis, we have now examined genetic variation among a
   total of 58 samples of non-migratory river galaxias from 24 river
   systems in South Island: 16 in the central region and eight to the
   south.
   Results Whereas samples from the central region do exhibit significant
   genetic structuring (Wright's F-ST = 0.331), they are more genetically
   homogeneous (mean Nei's D = 0.032) than populations to the south of the
   Waitaki River (F-ST = 0.826, mean D = 0.374).
   Main conclusions The results concur with our expectations of differences
   between the central and southern regions. We suggest that the divergence
   in the south reflects geological stability, whereas relatively shallow
   divergences within the central region reflects the more recent formation
   of the Canterbury Plain and its unstable braided rivers. The genetic
   structuring of this group has been promoted by the absence of the marine
   juvenile phase that is found in five other members of the genus native
   to NZ. This diversity of the southern region mirrors its diverse flora
   and invertebrate fauna, and has conservation implications that parallel
   those resulting from our improved knowledge of the NZ herpetofauna
   through the application of genetic analysis.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{209}},
Pages = {{257-273}},
Abstract = {{In marine benthic organisms with a pelagic larval phase, assessment of
   recruitment regulation necessitates accurate estimates of larval supply
   and initial settlement densities. We assessed 2 commonly used methods
   for estimating decapod larval supply, plankton net tows and artificial
   settlement substrates (ASS), together with a new technique using
   passive-migration traps. The aim was to evaluate how these methods
   estimate larval supply and settlement of 3 common decapod species (the
   shore crab Carcinus maenas L., the brown shrimp Crangon crangon L, and
   the grass shrimps Palaemon spp.) in a microtidal nursery area on the
   Swedish west coast. and to assess how these estimates relate to the
   juvenile recruitment of these species. Discrete plankton net tows
   outside the shallow nursery area collected a higher proportion of larvae
   at an early development stage, compared to the other methods. and
   produced only a snapshot of the variable water-column abundance of shore
   crab and grass shrimp larvae that correlated poorly with numbers
   collected with ASS at the same location. Artificial settlement
   substrates appeared to produce good, integrated relative estimates of
   shore crab larval supply and settlement. The number of larvae collected
   from ASS correlated significantly with larval abundance estimated by
   passive-migration traps in shallow nursery areas, and reflected changes
   in shore crab settlement densities in caged mussel habitats. We did not
   detect any effect of predation on ASS placed in nursery areas. However,
   a large proportion tan estimated 83\%) of shore crab postlarvae appeared
   to emigrate from ASS immersed for periods longer than 12 h, possibly
   during the night. All grass shrimp larvae appeared to emigrate from the
   collectors within 24 h, suggesting that ASS immersed longer than 12 h do
   not produce useful integrated estimates of larval supply for this
   species. These results demonstrate the importance of assessing
   postlarval emigration patterns from ASS to optimize immersion and
   collection time, and to avoid confounded estimates of larval abundance
   and settlement. PI new method using replicated passive migration traps
   that fished continuously in opposite directions ton-shore and off-shore)
   gave promising integrated estimates of net fluxes (total number
   immigrating minus number emigrating per unit time) of both pelagic
   postlarvae and early benthic juvenile stages of crabs and shrimp. The
   majority of the brown shrimp recruits were young juveniles,
   demonstrating the importance of incorporating juvenile migration in
   recruitment studies of motile benthic species. High numbers of shore
   crab and grass shrimp larvae were found to emigrate from the bay,
   indicating that many decapod postlarvae found in nursery areas may be
   transitional. The emigrating larvae were on average in an earlier
   development stage than those migrating to the bay. These short-term
   experiments demonstrate the importance of assessing larval development
   stage and migratory behavior when estimating larval supply and
   settlement for recruitment studies.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored the determinants of spread of four alien Pinus
   species and the ability of models to predict invasion dynamics in a
   complex fragmented landscape. The role of environmental factors, natural
   and anthropogenic disturbance in relation to invasion history was
   assessed for different stages in the invasion process using a Geographic
   Information System. Pines escaped from plantations over the past 30
   years and spread into the natural semi-arid shrubland (renosterveld).
   The pattern of spread was compared with a simulated random distribution
   using two different techniques, a standard logistic regression, and a
   new recursive modelling approach (Formal Inference-based Recursive
   Modelling; FIRM). FIRM analysis improved the accuracy of predictions and
   revealed interactive effects of variables hidden by the logistic
   regression analysis. More than 80\% of isolated pine individuals were
   found in 20\% of the habitat classified as suitable by the models. Soil
   pH was the most important predictor for the distribution of isolated
   trees, whereas the establishment of dense pine stands was largely
   determined by fire history. Differences in invasive behaviour could be
   explained by species attributes such as limited dispersal for P.
   canariensis, and better drought-tolerance for P. halepensis. Sixty-five
   percent of the current pine distribution was accurately predicted by the
   spatial distribution of the first trees to have invaded. Such models
   could be used to predict potential spread of invasive plants and gain a
   better understanding of the main factors driving the invasion process.
   However, the spread of invasive species in fragmented landscapes,
   strongly modified by human activities, is very complicated, and the
   spread remains difficult to predict in the long term. The dynamics of
   invasion are discussed in relation to changes in land use and
   disturbance regime.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands cover 40\% of the earth's surface and support animal-based
   industries; maintain soil cover, watersheds and biodiversity; sequester
   atmospheric carbon for storage in the soil; and provide tourism and
   leisure income. Diseases continue to decrease herbage and seed yield and
   reduce nutritive value and palatability of grasslands to impact on
   animal health and productivity but realistic data on loss are hard to
   find. Although principles of disease management remain the same,
   strategies used in crop protection can not be directly applied to
   grasslands due to differences in heterogeneity, population size, density
   and spatial distribution and population continuity. Low per hectare
   monetary return and the need to maintain disease control over a large
   area for a long time restrict the choice of control options. Genetic
   approaches are the most cost-effective and host resistance has been used
   mostly through selection. Molecular markers have improved efficiency of
   selection in species like Stylosanthes. Forms and mechanisms of
   resistance are important considerations. Quantitative multi-gene
   resistance is often longer-lasting than qualitative single-gene
   resistance, which is more prone to breakdown by new pathogen virulence.
   Grassland disease management has gained from new knowledge on the
   molecular basis of plant pathogen interaction and disease resistance.
   Many important forage grass and legume species have been genetically
   transformed as a first step towards introducing existing and novel
   disease resistance genes. At the same time, community concern over
   generically modified organisms has grown and commercial exploitation of
   genetically modified grassland species will depend on environmental,
   economic and social imperatives. Rapid evolution of new pathogen races
   to devastate previously resistant varieties has been a consequence of
   host resistance. Strategic deployment of resistance genes is one way to
   combat pathogen variability. Genes can be deployed through heterogeneous
   cultivar mixtures relatively easily but this does not always provide
   long-term solution, and gene pyramiding may be more suitable. As threat
   of exotic pathogen incursion increase due to rising global trade and
   tourism, sharing knowledge of pathogen variation between trading
   countries through strong international collaboration becomes necessary
   to manage this risk. Pathogens interact with changing climate and
   biodiversity to impact on the sustainability of land and grassland
   ecosystems. Plant protection professionals will have to think beyond
   their disciplinary expertise to seek and invite concepts and frameworks
   at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales to manage grassland
   health.}},

Abstract = {{The multiple benefits of perennial agriculture, including forages and
   grasslands, for building soil quality, protection of natural resources,
   enhancement of biodiversity and wildlife, are well known to us, but
   little understood by the public. This is not a situation where ``more
   education{''} would necessarily increase recognition. Rather, we must
   build in the public a desire for the enhancement of green space, clean
   water and air, and diverse landscapes that multiple purpose agriculture
   can bring. We seek such environments intuitively and now that much of
   the world's people are ``trapped{''} in urban settings of steel and
   concrete, this desire is even more apparent.
   Yet other forces continually work against using agriculture for such
   uses. Economic motives are at the base of the conflict. Grasslands
   seldom produce recognizable returns. It is important for grassland
   scientists to bring to the public forum the benefits of their unique
   approach, even while the agricultural world seems to be moving toward a
   grain-based economy. Such recognition is necessary if public support of
   conservation incentives are to become a part of agriculture. Rotational
   grazing offers one way around the economic issue, and will be discussed
   in detail. Other economic approaches involve government leasing and
   government recognition of environmental benefits (Conservation Reserve
   Program).
   A concept gaining support involves carbon trading. This is payment to
   the land owner by public or private entities for conservation practices
   that sequester carbon, thereby reducing the carbon dioxide load in the
   atmosphere and slowing global climate change. Carbon trading could
   ultimately be endorsed in the Kyoto treaty, making carbon sequestration
   a part of national policies and a new way to support multifuctional
   agriculture.
   The paper will discuss pros and cons of several management options that
   will require the use of perennial crops, grasslands in particular. Ways
   are also discussed to engage the public in the decision making process.
   The bottom line, however, is that in some way or the other grasslands
   systems often must be subsidized in the United States.}},

Abstract = {{The expectations of consumers ultimately determine the specification of
   product quality; and grassland systems produce a wide range of
   animal-based products. Therefore, to provide focus, this paper deals
   only with food products that are destined for markets that exhibit
   strong discretionary choice. Quality expectations of consumers have
   traditionally been based on product attributes such as taste, freshness,
   nutritional value and appearance, but customer expectations are
   expanding to encompass food safety, environmental care, animal welfare
   and biotechnologies.
   Grassland forages and their management influence the intrinsic sensory
   properties of food. A dairy products case study is presented, indicating
   that pasture species and their interaction with local environmental
   factors, and the methods of forage conservation, can influence the
   chemical composition of milk, its ability to be processed into butter or
   cheese, and the final sensory characteristics of the product. These
   effects may result directly from compounds originating in the forage
   (e.g. carotenoids, aromatic terpenes) or indirectly through
   forage-related changes in animal physiology and enzyme production.
   Knowledge of these influences and the strict control of the determining
   factors are key elements in the granting of Protected Denomination of
   Origin (DMO) status and the benefits that accrue from marketing
   strategies that depend on this status.
   Animal feeding regimes also influence the attributes of meat.
   Pasture-grazed animals have harder and yellower carcass fat than
   grain-fed animals. The daily energy intake of pasture-grazed animals is
   also generally lower; therefore there is less intra-muscular marbling.
   In addition, glycogen levels tend to be more marginal, which can
   negatively interact with psychological stress to produce a greater
   incidence of high ultimate pH carcasses. High pH levels (>5.8) result in
   reduced tenderness, dark muscle and reduced shelf-life of fresh and
   chilled meats. Early identification of product quality variation is key
   to placing meat into the correct supply chain, and maximising the total
   value of the carcass. The positive and negative aspects of fatty acid
   profiles, phenol and indole compounds, and antioxidants originating from
   forages are discussed in respect of meat flavour and animal health.
   Tight planning and management protocols for both plants and animals are
   crucial to achieving quality raw material from grassland systems. Unlike
   feedlot and barn-based enterprises, variation in forage quantity and
   quality can severely impact on animal performance, timeliness of supply
   and raw product constituents. Control of a forage-based system requires
   the setting of performance targets and on-going monitoring. Such
   measures can signal when the tactical use of specialist forages, or of
   high-quality supplements, will be of most value in maintaining target
   performance and animal health. Consistently supplying products with
   desired attributes, attending to animal welfare expectations and caring
   for environmental integrity will all be required if the credibility of
   `natural' grassland products is to be sustained in the market-place.
   Controlled grazing of animals will be invaluable in meeting these
   multiple market demands.}},

Abstract = {{Previous reports described an increase in population density following
   the removal of 23 adult and 3 subadult male black bears (Ursus
   americanus) from a 218-km(2) study area near Cold Lake, Alberta (the
   CLSA). This finding plays a central role in continuing debates over
   population regulation in bears, but has been criticized because density
   estimates were based on assumptions that were not met. Moreover,
   subsequent discussion has been predicated on conjecture that human
   exploitation had minimal influence on population dynamics. We used
   improved methods of mark-recapture and survival analysis with a
   combination of new and previously published data to resolve these
   issues. Jolly-Seber estimates suggest numbers of females using the CLSA
   were relatively stable from 1969 to 1971, then more than doubled when
   males were captured and euthanized during 1971-72. Numbers remained high
   until 1975, when they declined abruptly. Similarly, numbers of subadult
   males captured annually increased disproportionately in 1972 and
   remained high until 1976, when they also declined. Changes in numbers of
   subadult males captured indicated changes in local density because they
   were not caused by changes in capture or settling rates. These findings
   support previous descriptions of trends in bear density at Cold Lake.
   However, survival records of 56 bears radiomarked during 1974-77
   revealed heavier exploitation than previously suspected. Annual
   mortality rates of radiomarked bears ranged from 14 to 51\%, and humans
   caused at least 25 of 30 observed deaths. Consequently, an underlying
   assumption of previous interpretations-that the Cold Lake bear
   population was naturally regulated near carrying capacity-no longer
   seems reasonable. Our results suggest that adult males deterred bears in
   other sex-age groups from using the CLSA; however, we found no evidence
   that birth or death rates were affected. Thus, the observed increase in
   local density should not be construed as a density-dependent response.
   Abrupt changes in local density might not have occurred if males had
   been removed from a larger area encompassing the CLSA.}},

Number = {{2-3}},
Pages = {{147-186}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the
   development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly
   increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in
   nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of
   species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of
   models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography,
   conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species
   management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat
   distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is
   growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are
   very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions.
   Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification
   methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM),
   environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The
   selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on
   statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect
   theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response
   (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the
   trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In
   the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related
   to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an
   appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including
   threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap,
   cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the
   accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure
   should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly
   lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of
   prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the
   model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one
   to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are
   suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on
   the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the
   usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{If causes of population fluctuation vary temporally, then tests that
   search for density dependence in long time series cannot distinguish, at
   any given time, how much population change is due to density-dependent
   or density-independent factors. For some species' dynamics, however, it
   is possible to determine over a restricted period whether
   density-dependent factors are involved in reducing population densities.
   I use a new Return Trajectory Likelihood Ratio Test (RTLRT) to determine
   whether a population perturbed to high density (e.g., by periodic
   recruitment) exhibits density dependence by returning to a positive
   asymptote (or leveling density, L) or is density independent and,
   through proportional hazards, approaches zero exponentially.
   In a series of simulations, declines after recruitment were mimicked by
   creating sequences that changed due to a combination of
   density-dependent and density-independent factors. Until the sequence
   dropped below L, losses due to each mortality type were combined; after
   that point the density-dependent component was discontinued. The power
   of the test was assessed over a range of decline rates (e(-b), where b =
   0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1) to zero and to L, initial density
   values (2, 4, and 6 times higher than L), and observation and process
   errors (e(sigma) where sigma = 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5). Test size was
   assessed by generating trajectories with no density-dependent decline.
   These simulations identified four critical parameters that influence the
   likelihood of detecting density-dependent decline. (1) Detection rates
   change with the ratio of initial recruitment peak to leveling density:
   high peaks generally increase detection, although they may decrease
   detection of slow density-dependent declines. (2) High rates of
   density-dependent decline relative to density-independent decline also
   improve detection, except that populations rapidly dropping below L will
   appear density independent regardless of dynamics governing change prior
   to that time. (3) Error reduces detection of density dependence, except
   when declines are shallow and process error is assumed. (4) Slow rates
   of density-independent decline (to <10\% of original value) cause the
   RTLRT to detect density dependence when it is not present (i.e., size is
   excessive for slow declines).
   As an example of how the RTLRT may be used, I apply it to four years of
   monthly counts of an intertidal isopod, Idotea wosnesenskii, which
   recruits annually to high densities under boulders. Based on the RTLRT,
   subsequent declines were density dependent in some years, although
   detection differed with the assumption of process or observation error,
   and with the use of separate or averaged samples. In addition to density
   dependence, selective mortality of one class of individuals or mortality
   balanced by continuing low immigration could also cause steep declines
   to L. For isopods, however, densities were higher under boulders with
   small depressions than under smooth controls, suggesting that declines
   may occur when densities exceed the number of safe sites available. The
   postrecruitment decline of I. wosnesenskii appears to be at least
   partially density dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Despite Chile has been one of the pioneering countries in studies of
   human impact on marine communities, and despite the enormous economic
   and social significance that the marine environment has for the country,
   the development of marine conservation programs and the scientific basis
   for sustainability has not kept pace, with the exploitation rate of
   marine fisheries and the increasing use of the coast for other purposes.
   Although we think that the establishment of any conservation policies
   along the vast coastline of Chile must be based on a multitude of
   approaches and considerations, scientific, biological, and ecological
   principles should guide much of these efforts. In this paper, we attempt
   to present a general overview of the current knowledge about the ecology
   and biogeography of nearshore systems in Chile. Based on the most
   relevant existing information, our goals are to: 1) Identify major
   biogeographic and ecological features of nearshore ecosystems, and the
   obvious gaps in information, 2) identify the most harmful human
   activities impacting the structure and dynamics of these systems, and 3)
   suggest the possible use of indicators to assess the conservational
   status of different environments along the coast. This overview shows,
   on one side, the geographic areas of deficitary knowledge on nearshore
   environments that are critical for future marine conservation and
   management plans, and on the other, the availability of high quality
   information for other geographic areas along the coast. Regarding the
   taxonomy and large-scale patterns of species distribution, important
   gaps in information were detected, however no big changes in the total
   number of species are expected in the future. There are few large-scale
   patterns of species distribution are reported in the literature, and in
   this contribution, but more work needs to be done, particularly for some
   taxa, to identify areas of high species diversity as well as areas which
   possess unique characteristics in terms of ecosystem processes (e.g.,
   particular disturbance and upwelling regimes in coastal marine
   ecosystems) and species (e.g., endemic and keystone species). For most
   marine invertebrates and macroalgae, hotspots in species diversity are
   present in southern Chile. New studies addressing the causal factors
   generating these large-scale patterns of species distribution are also
   needed; information about coastal oceanography and larval supply is
   still poor. This information crucial for the design of a marine reserve
   network. The information available on community structure and ecosystem
   functioning, especially highlighting the effect of human impact, comes
   from very few geographic regions. More information about community
   structure for other areas of the coast is required, particularly
   considering the strong differences in temperature, circulation patterns,
   habitat heterogeneity, species composition, as well as of upwelling and
   El Nino effects along the 4,000 km of coastline. Finally, we list what
   we think are the most harmful human activities by area and environment
   along the coast, and integrate this information to suggest possible
   environmental indicators, and basic needs and guidelines for marine
   conservation in Chile.}},

Abstract = {{Phenological changes over the year influence the species cover and
   consequently the data of the releves. This may have an undesired effect
   on the results. Due to differences in climatic conditions between years
   and in different regions, the date of the year is not an adequate
   variable to describe the date of sampling. The present paper presents a
   new multivariate analysis of symphenological releves to describe the
   influence of phenology on floristic structure of the vegetation and for
   bioclimatological analysis.
   The aim of the investigation was to analyse the influence of the cutting
   date and fertilizer input on the species composition and cover of hay
   meadows. A total of 850 releves was taken in Bavaria. The cover of all
   species was measured quantitatively and the phenological state was
   determined for all the species.
   Two new multivariate methods for analysing phenological data are
   described. Phenological sequencing is a heuristic algorithm that yields
   in a rank order describing the phenological development of the
   vegetation within a vegetation period. The phenological index is based
   on probability functions and results in a continuous description of
   vegetation's phenology. The phenological index can be used in canonical
   analysis as a covariable to eliminate undesired effects of the
   phenological development during the sampling period on the results of
   multivariate analysis. Furthermore the phenological index can be used to
   characterise the bioclimatological conditions of different regions or
   sites. Finally the phenological probability function can be used to
   generate a rank order of the phenological development of species.
   The phenological index has a significant influence on the floristic
   composition of the vegetation. The correlation between the date of the
   year and the phenological index showed a high significant relationship.
   The regression lines for the regression between date and phenological
   index for the years 1995 and 1996 in the district Ansbach (in North
   Bavaria) are shown. The regional climate of several Bavarian districts
   is characterised in terms of their average phenological development.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of species living within a spatially fragmented habitat may
   be affected by interspecific competition on a regional time scale.
   Metapopulation theory is a potentially powerful tool for understanding
   the dynamics of such competing species, but metapopulation models with
   competition are often too complex to be useful as guides for empirical
   investigation. In this paper I employ two techniques from dynamical
   systems theory (perturbation expansion and the examination of invariant
   manifolds) in a qualitative and quantitative analysis of two-species
   competition within a metapopulation, with the goal of using geometric
   ideas to provide insight into how competition affects species living in
   a fragmented habitat. Four-state metapopulation competition models
   (where habitat patches may be occupied by either of two competing
   species, both, or neither) can be analyzed as perturbations of simpler
   three-state models (those without doubly occupied patches as one of the
   state variables). Symmetric competition for patches is always unstable
   in three-state Levins-type metapopulations, but generally stable in
   analogous mainland-island systems. The attracting manifold of a
   three-state system has the form of an invariant curve joining the two
   species' Levins equilibria. Under asymmetric competition for patches,
   coexistence is possible only if the inferior competitor possesses a
   higher equilibrium proportion of occupied patches in the absence of
   competition. Asymmetric competition changes the nature of the attracting
   manifold, with the limit case a curve that is locally tangent to a line
   parallel to the axis for the proportion of occupied patches of the
   inferior competitor. The interior equilibrium of a four-state model can
   be calculated as a perturbation expansion in a parameter alpha, the
   fraction of doubly occupied patches that contribute to recolonization.
   The perturbation method in conjunction with center manifold analysis
   proves that coexistence of like species within a metapopulation is
   possible if and only if there is recolonization from doubly occupied
   patches. Rescue effects may make competitive coexistence impossible via
   the creation of a saddle-point equilibrium having one-dimensional stable
   and unstable manifolds. Application of the theory to published data from
   several species of Daphnia in Fennoscandia shows good quantitative
   agreement with observations and makes several new qualitative
   predictions. The results are discussed in connection with ecological
   dynamics of similar forms, including those in the process of speciation.}},

Abstract = {{The composition and structure of native riverine ecosystems are tightly
   linked to natural hydrologic variability. By managing river flows for
   water supplies and power generation water management agencies have
   inadvertently caused considerable degradation of riverine ecosystems and
   associated biodiversity. New approaches for meeting human needs for
   water while conserving the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems
   are greatly needed We describe an approach for identifying the natural
   flooding characteristics that must be protected or restored to maintain
   riparian (floodplain) ecosystems along meandering rivers. We developed a
   computer model to simulate flood-driven changes in the relative
   abundance of riparian patch types along the Yampa River in Colorado
   (U.S.A). The model is based on research suggesting that the duration of
   flooding at or above 209 m(3) per second (125\% of bankfull discharge)
   is particularly important in driving lateral channel migration which is
   responsible for initiating ecological succession in the Yampa's riparian
   forest. Other hydrologic variables, such as the magnitude of annual peak
   flows, were not as strongly correlated with lateral channel migration
   rates. Model simulations enabled us to tentatively identify a threshold
   of alteration of flood duration that could lead to substantial changes
   in the abundance of forest patch types over time should river flows be
   regulated by future water projects. Based on this analysis, we suggest
   an ecologically compatible water management approach that avoids
   crossing flood alteration thresholds and provides opportunity to use a
   portion of flood waters for human purposes. Recommended improvements to
   the Yampa model include obtaining additional low-elevation aerial
   photographs of the river corridor to enable better estimation of channel
   migration rates and vegetation changes. These additional data should
   greatly improve the model's accuracy and predictive capabilities and
   therefore its management value.}},

Abstract = {{We quantified the molecular energies and forces involved in opening and
   closing of mechanoelectrical transducer channels in hair cells using a
   novel generally applicable method. It relies on a thermodynamic
   description of the free energy of an ion channel in terms of its open
   probability. The molecular gating force per channel as reflected in hair
   bundle mechanics is shown to equal kT/I(X) x dI(X)/dX, where I is the
   transducer current and X the deflection of the hair bundle. We applied
   the method to previously measured I(X) curves in mouse outer hair cells
   (OHCs) and vestibular hair cells (VHCs). Contrary to current models of
   transduction, gating of the transducer channel was found to involve only
   a finite range of flee energy (< 10 kT), a consequence of our
   observation that the channel has a finite minimum open probability of
   ca. 1\% for inhibitory bundle deflections. The maximum gating forces per
   channel of both cell types were found to be comparable (ca. 300-500 fN).
   Because of differences in passive restoring forces, gating forces result
   in very limited mechanical nonlinearity in OHC bundles compared to that
   in VHC bundles. A kinetic model of channel activation is proposed that
   accounts for the observed transducer currents and gating forces. It also
   predicts adaptation-like effects and spontaneous bundle movements
   ensuing from changes in state energy gaps possibly related to
   interactions of the channel with calcium ions.}},

Abstract = {{Existing country studies of the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare

Abstract = {{Aim This study compares human impacts and forest ecosystem response
   across geographical regions. Such a comparison allows us to evaluate the
   relationship between regional changes in forest composition and regional
   patterns of human activity.
   Location Four study areas in the north-eastern USA were investigated,
   two of which were dominated by oak-pine forests at the time of European
   settlement (Central Massachusetts, MA; Pike County, PA), and two of
   which were dominated by beech and hemlock (South Berkshire, MA; Wayne
   County, PA).
   Methods Trees recorded in early land survey records were compiled and
   compared with data on modern forest composition obtained from recent
   forest inventories. To assess the similarity of the four regions with
   regard to species composition, Euclidean Distances (ED) were calculated
   between the colonial and modern forest composition for each of the four
   regions. Information about the history of human impacts in the four
   study regions was used to interpret the changes in forest composition.
   Results General changes in forest composition through the historical
   period include a decline in beech, hemlock and chestnut, and an increase
   in maple and birch. Changes in pine and oak were minor by comparison.
   Supraregional human impacts are generally linked with supraregional
   trends in species composition, whereas regional patterns of land use
   caused regional patterns of change in species composition.
   Main conclusions These results suggest that human activities do not
   necessarily lead to more similar species composition between regions,
   especially if these activities show clear spatial patterns at about the
   same resolution that species composition is evaluated. Comparing
   species-specific changes in forest composition with species-specific
   human activities on the same spatial scale is crucial in order to
   evaluate human impacts on ecosystems and to make more robust
   generalizations about the temporal dynamics of landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{This payer documents a series of methodological innovations that are
   relevant to macroevolutionary studies. The new methods are applied to
   updated faunal and body mass data sets for North American fossil
   mammals, documenting several key trends across the late Cretaceous and
   Cenozoic. The methods are (1) A maximum likelihood formulation of
   appearance event ordination. The reformulated criterion involves
   generating a maximally likely hypothesized relative ordering of first
   and last appearances (i.e., an age range chart). The criterion takes
   faunal occurrences, stratigraphic relationships, and the sampling
   probability of individual genera and species into account. (2) A
   nonparametric temporal interpolation method called ``shrink-wrapping{''}
   that makes it possible to employ the greatest possible number of tie
   points without violating monotonicity or allowing abrupt changes in
   slopes. The new calibration method is used in computing pro visional
   definitions of boundaries among North American land mammal ages. (3)
   Additional methods for randomized subsampling of faunal lists, one
   weighting the number of lists that have been drawn by the sum of the
   square of the number of occurrences in each list, and one further
   modifying this approach to account for long-term changes in average
   local species richness. (4) Foote's new equations for instantaneous
   speciation and extinction rates. The equations are rederived and used to
   generate time series, confirm that logistic dynamics result from the
   diversity dependence of speciation but not extinction, and define the
   median duration of species (i.e., 2.6 m.y, for Eocene-Pleistocene
   mammals). (5) A method employing the G likelihood ratio statistic that
   is used to quantify the volatility of changes in the relative proportion
   of species falling in each of several major taxonomic groups. (6)
   Univariate measures of body mass distributions based on ordinary moment
   statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis). These
   measures are favored over the method of cenogram analysis. Data are
   presented showing that even diverse individual fossil collections merely
   yield a noisy version of the same pattern seen in the overall
   continental data set. peaks in speciation rates, extinction rates,
   proportional volatility and shifts in body mass distributions occur at
   different times, suggesting that environmental perturbations do not have

   national analysis. The method development is composed of strategic
   selection of criteria for natural and cultural values, development of
   classification systems, development of techniques for aerial photo
   interpretation, methods for fieldwork and description, evaluation and
   ranking. The data collection is based on interpretation in stereo pairs
   of colour infrared (CIR) aerial photographs with selection of
   potentially valuable meadows and pastures which are inventoried and
   checked in the field for cultural-historical nature types, cultural
   elements, vegetation types and selected indicator species of vascular
   plants. They are also described from a holistic landscape ecological
   perspective, integrating the cultural and biological components within
   the entire landscape and, finally, ranked for nature conservation into
   four classes. The evaluation emphasises botanical values together with
   long-term continuity in landuse and management, underpinned with
   cultural components. The national analysis showed that nearly 200,000 ha
   of ancient meadows and pastures are well managed and of high value. They
   are distributed among more than 17,000 objects and 22
   cultural-historical nature types. Most were pastures (98\%). The result
   is not only increased knowledge of the distribution of ancient meadows
   and pastures and a high number of well-managed pasture landscapes
   throughout Sweden, but also a change in attitude among farmers, towards
   more positive attitudes to nature conservation and biodiversity and
   understanding of the cultural landscape. This project has had an
   important influence, because if is used in regional nature conservation
   work, has formed the principal basis of several thousands of management
   agreements with farmers, is used in policy work in the national nature
   protection plan and in the biodiversity action plan. The database also
   provides a good foundation for research in cultural landscapes,
   biodiversity and landscape ecology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to predict the effects of climatic
   variation at multiple temporal frequencies on seedling establishment by
   two congeneric C-4 perennial grasses (Bouteloua gracilis and B.
   eriopoda) at the ecotone between shortgrass steppe grassland and
   Chihuahuan desert grassland in central New Mexico, USA. The approach was
   to use a daily time-step simulation model to determine the occurrence of
   a recruitment event in each year based upon the amount and timing of
   soil water required for establishment. Historical weather data were used
   to predict effects of seasonal and interdecadal variation in climate on
   establishment. A sensitivity analysis was used to predict effects of
   directional climate change on establishment.
   Bouteloua gracilis had a broad pattern of simulated establishment from
   May through September that included periods with high year-to-year
   variation in precipitation. B. eriopoda establishment events occurred
   primarily in July when precipitation amounts were most reliable.
   Climatic conditions from 1949 through 1968 were more favorable for B.
   eriopoda establishment compared to the cooler, wetter conditions from
   1969 through 1988 that favored B. gracilis. Establishment of B. eriopoda
   was lowest in El Nino years whereas B. gracilis establishment was
   highest in La Nina years. Establishment of B. gracilis was most
   sensitive to temperature when precipitation was higher than current
   amounts. The greatest response to temperature by B. eriopoda for all
   precipitation amounts occurred at cooler temperatures than found
   currently.
   These results indicate that climatic variation at multiple frequencies
   has differential effects on seedling establishment for these two
   perennial grasses, and may account at least in part for patterns in
   dominance at this biome transition zone.}},

Abstract = {{A method of upscaling a site-based crop model to obtain regional and
   national results on spring wheat productivity under changing climate is
   presented. The model, CERES-Wheat, was calibrated and validated first at
   sites, and in the upscaling phase it was run across a regular 10 x 10 km
   grid over Finland. In the grid the model was run both for the
   present-day (1961-1996) climate and scenarios of future climate for
   2050. Regional averages were computed for the years 1981-1996 to be
   comparable to yield observations in the farm yield statistics.
   CERES-Wheat does not consider crop stress caused by poor soil aeration
   under wet conditions; however, this was found to be crucial to obtain
   satisfactory simulation results at sites. The model was modified
   accordingly, and the new version labelled `CERES-Wet-Wheat'. The results
   indicate that CERES-Wet-Wheat was able to detect both at the site and
   regional scale yield variations dependent on climate, even though the
   approach did not consider variations in crop management, pests and
   diseases and soil dependent differences in initial conditions. A
   regional approach to estimate future yields is useful especially at
   northern latitudes where crop suitability is likely to shift under
   changing climate. However, in a regional assessment there are many
   uncertainties associated with the yield estimates, including
   uncertainties in projections of future climate, model errors and
   assumptions and observation errors. For this reason, the underlying
   assumptions need to be clear when the estimates in yield changes are
   interpreted. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the direction, magnitude, and timing of changes in bird
   population abundance is essential to enable species of priority
   conservation concern to be identified, and reasons for the population
   changes to be understood. We give a brief review of previous techniques
   fur the analysis of large-scale survey data and present a new approach
   based on generalized additive models (GAMs). GAMs are used to model
   trend as a smooth, nonlinear function of time, and they provide a
   framework for testing the statistical significance of changes in
   abundance. In addition, the secund derivatives of the modeled trend
   curve may be used to identify key years in which the direction of the
   population trajectory was seen to change significantly. The inclusion of
   covariates into models for population abundance is also discussed and
   illustrated, and tests for the significance of covariate terms are
   given. We apply the methods to data from the Common Birds Census of the
   British Trust for Ornithology for 13 species of farmland birds. Seven of
   the species are shown to have experienced statistically significant
   declines since the mid-1960s, Two species exhibited a significant
   increase. The population trajectories of all but three species turned
   downward in the 1970s, although in most cases the 1980s brought either
   some recovery or a decrease in the rate of decline. The majority of
   populations have remained relatively stable in the 1990s. The results

Abstract = {{Aim We assessed the independent and interactive effects of land use and
   other factors on regional distributions of lake shore bird assemblages.
   Location Analyses were restricted to lakes of the northeastern United
   States (New England, New York, New Jersey).
   Methods Lake shore bird and habitat data were collected from a regional
   sample of 186 lakes between 1991 and 1995. Local and regional gradients
   in environmental attributes of the lakes and their watersheds, and in
   bird species composition, were characterized using detrended
   correspondence analysis. Bird assemblages were also characterized with
   respect to species diversity total bird abundance, and absolute and
   proportional abundance for neotropical migrants, omnivores and tree
   foragers. The assemblage measures were compared with the environmental
   gradients and with the environmental variables from which those
   gradients were derived using correlations, linear regression and
   bivariate plots.
   Results Anthropogenic variables (e.g. human density) and
   nonanthropogenic variables (e.g. climate, forest composition, lake
   productivity) were highly confounded regionally, reflecting the
   influence of climate and geomorphology on land use and, in turn, the
   influence of land use on the environment. Moving south along the
   regional gradient to watersheds with more intensive land use, changes in
   bird assemblage structure were consistent with anthropogenic effects on
   the avifauna attributable to forest fragmentation: total bird abundance
   increased, fragmentation-tolerant species were encountered more
   frequently, the proportional abundance of omnivores increased and the
   proportional abundances of tree foragers and neotropical migrants
   decreased. Bird diversity, as assayed using rarefaction, peaked at an
   intermediate position along the regional gradient, as did the absolute
   abundances of tree foragers and migrants.
   Main conclusions We propose that some community attributes peaked at an
   intermediate position along the regional gradient as a result of the
   interactive effects of land use and other factors on this region's
   avifauna, with broad-scale anthropogenic factors constraining
   assemblages on the urbanized lakes, and climate or other
   nonanthropogenic factors constraining assemblages on the pristine lakes.
   Anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic factors of similar scale and
   magnitude thus acted in concert to shape regional bird distributions.}},

   implications for scaling from seedlings to mature trees}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{We investigated scaling of physiological parameters between age classes
   of Quercus rubra by combining in situ field measurements with an
   experimental approach. In the in situ field study, we investigated
   changes in drought response with age in seedlings, juveniles, and mature
   trees of Q. rubra. Throughout the particularly dry summer of 1995 and
   the unusually wet summer of 1996 in New England, we measured water
   potential of leaves (Psi(Leaf)) and gas exchange of plants at three
   sites at the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts. In order to
   determine what fraction of the measured differences in gas exchange
   between seedlings and mature trees was due to environment versus
   ontogeny, an experiment was conducted in which seedlings were grown
   under light and soil moisture regimes simulating the environment of
   mature trees. The photosynthetic capacity of mature trees was three-fold
   greater than that of seedlings during the wet year, and six-fold greater
   during the drought year. The seedling experiment demonstrated that the
   difference in photosynthetic capacity between seedlings and mature trees
   is comprised equally of an environmental component (50\%) and an
   ontogenetic component (50\%) in the absence of water limitation.
   Photosynthesis was depressed more severely in seedlings than in mature
   trees in the drought year relative to the wet year, while juveniles
   showed an intermediate response. Throughout the drought, the predawn
   leaf water potential (Psi(PD)) of seedlings became increasingly negative
   (-0.4 to -1.6 MPa), while that of mature trees became only slightly more
   negative (-0.2 to -0.5 MPa). Again, juveniles showed an intermediate
   response (-0.25 to -0.8 MPa). During the wet summer of 1996, however,
   there was no difference in Psi(PD) between seedlings, juveniles and
   mature trees. During the dry summer of 1995, seedlings were more
   responsive to a major rain event than mature trees in terms of
   Psi(Leaf), suggesting that the two age classes depend on different water
   sources. In all age classes, instantaneous measurements of intrinsic
   water use efficiency (WUEi), defined as C assimilation rate divided by
   stomatal conductance, increased as the drought progressed, and all age
   classes halt higher WUEi during the drought year than in the wet year.
   Mature trees, however, showed a greater ability to increase their WUEi
   in response to drought. Integrated measurements of WUE from C isotope
   discrimination (Delta) of leaves indicated higher WUE in mature trees
   than juveniles and seedlings. Differences between years, however, could
   not be distinguished, probably due to the strong bias in C isotope
   fractionation at the time of leaf production, which occurred prior to
   the onset of drought conditions in 1995. From this study, we arrive at
   two main conclusions:
   1. Different age classes of Q. rubra use different strategies for
   responding to drought. Seedlings resist drought by closing stomata early
   in the day at the expense of C uptake; mature trees avoid drought
   conditions by accessing deeper water reserves and adjusting WUE.
   2. Only through studies which separate environmental differences from
   ontogenetic differences can parameters measured on seedlings be scaled
   to mature trees.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The species-area relationship (SAR) has been used successfully to
   predict extinction from extent of habitat reduction. These extinction
   estimates assume that species have uniformly distributed range
   requirements and a minimum abundance level required for persistence; how
   many species are lost depends solely on how much habitat is removed, not
   on where it is removed. We consider another limiting case in which range
   requirements, rather than abundances, determine extinctions. We used a
   new method for constructing SARs based on assumptions about geographic
   ranges of species. Our results show that habitat destruction can change
   the SAR and consequently the number of species predicted to be lost due
   to habitat destruction. Our method generates SARs that vary in shape
   according to the specific distributions of geographic range and
   occupancy but that have the common feature of being described by a power
   law with an exponent of <1. When the geographic range of species was
   included in the SAR, the way habitat was lost became important. Although
   the SAR before habitat destruction is often used to predict species loss
   after habitat destruction, assumptions must be clearly stated. To
   predict the damage caused by habitat loss with our model, it is
   necessary to know the fraction of aggregated species, the distribution
   of geographic ranges, the form of habitat destruction, and the sampling
   protocol. The remaining theoretical challenge is to develop a full
   theory that links abundance and range.}},

Abstract = {{Biotic invaders are species that establish a new range in which they
   proliferate, spread, and persist to the detriment of the environment.
   They are the most important ecological outcomes from the unprecedented
   alterations in the distribution of the earth's biota brought about
   largely through human transport and commerce. In a world without
   borders, few if any areas remain sheltered from these immigrations.
   The fate of immigrants is decidedly mixed. Few survive the hazards of
   chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become
   naturalized. In turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. There
   are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some
   escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites;
   others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native
   communities. Ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently
   facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that
   foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and
   uncontrollable. Whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases
   inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) Animal invaders can cause
   extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing,
   competition, and habitat alteration. (2) Plant invaders can completely
   alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets
   in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival
   of native species. (3) In agriculture, the principal pests of temperate
   crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and
   crop losses constitute an onerous ``tax{''} on food, fiber, and forage
   production. (4) The global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases
   caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with
   susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable.
   Identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their
   dispersal and establishment constitutes an enormous challenge to both
   conservation and international commerce. Detection and management when
   exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) Efforts to
   identify general attributes of future invaders have often been
   inconclusive. (2) Predicting susceptible locales for future invasions
   seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates
   of arrival among potential invaders. (3) Eradication of an established
   invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy.
   Successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing
   diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) Control
   of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term,
   ecosystem-wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on
   battling individual invaders. (5) Prevention of invasions is much less
   costly than post-entry control. Revamping national and international
   quarantine laws by adopting a ``guilty until proven innocent{''}
   approach would be a productive first step.
   Failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively
   result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of
   agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions,
   disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on
   which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous,
   impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. Given their
   current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside
   human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of
   global change. Left unchecked, they will influence these other forces in
   profound but still unpredictable ways.}},

   coincident. Eighty-eight individual Canarian Brachyderes, sampled from
   across the distributions of each subspecies, have been sequenced for 570
   bp of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase II gene (COII).
   No mitotypes are shared among islands. Both maximum-likelihood and

   composed of a single monophyletic clade of mitotypes, El Hierro is
   composed of a single monophyletic clade occurring within a larger clade
   comprising all the La Palma mitotypes, and the mitotypes of these three
   islands form a rnonophyletic group distinct from Gran Canaria. New
   methods for estimating divergence times without the assumption of rate
   constancy have been used to reconstruct the direction and approximate

   from older to progressionally younger islands, and these colonizations
   are estimated to have occurred less than 2.6 million years ago, although
   the timing of the initial colonization of the archipelago is not
   discernable. New methods for the estimation of diversification rates

Abstract = {{Arithmetic and lognormal means historically have been used as estimates
   of exposure concentration for both human health and ecological risk
   assessment. Past risk assessment guidance has emphasized the need to
   include all available information, particularly regarding the spatial
   and temporal aspects of data and exposure. One estimate of exposure
   concentration that includes spatial information is the 95\% upper
   confidence limit (UCL) of the area-weighted mean. An area-weighted mean
   is calculated using weightings based on time ratio of the area
   associated with a sample location and the total area of the study area.
   Currently, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) risk assessment
   guidance recommends the use of the 95\% UCL of the arithmetic mean as
   the most appropriate measure of exposure concentration for soil and
   sediment in human health and ecological risk assessments. The purpose of
   this study was two-fold: (1) to evaluate the use of the 95\% UCL of the
   area-weighted mean vs. the 95\% UCL of the arithmetic mean for the
   lognormal distribution and the normal distribution using a large data
   set from a recent riverine sediment characterization study, and (2) to
   evaluate the potential associated with the different approaches for
   reduction in surface sediment exposure concentrations for 2,3,'7,8-TCDD
   and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) for several subsets of the
   data. The results of this evaluation indicated that there was no
   significant reduction in exposure concentrations of the study area
   surface sediments after any of the selected higher concentration data
   points had been removed from the various data subsets. In addition, this
   evaluation indicated that, due to its dependence on the variance of the
   data, the 95\% UCL of the arithmetic mean for a lognormal distribution
   produced subset exposure concentrations that were higher than the
   calculated concentrations of the full data set and produced the smallest
   percent changes in concentration compared to the other two measures.
   Based on this analysis, the 95\%. UCL of the area-weighted mean was
   determined to be the most stable and appropriate estimator of exposure
   concentration for surface sediments.}},

   yr BP and 18,000 C-14 pr BY for Canada and the eastern United States.
   The inferred modern biome distributions agree well with independent
   reconstructions of North American vegetation prior to European
   settlement. Some discrepancies between the pollen data and the modem
   potential vegetation are caused by post-settlement clearing of the
   landscape and the consequent increase of herbaceous types in the recent
   pollen record.
   Biome distributions at 6000 C-14 yr BP reflected the warmer and drier
   conditions then prevalent in the continental interior, but the overall
   position of biomes was similar to that of today. The boreal treeline in
   North America was not significantly north of its present position, in
   contrast to the 100-200 km shift reported for Siberia. At the last
   glacial maximum (18,000 C-14 yr BP), steppe and tundra were prevalent in
   the Midwest and northwestern Canada, and coniferous forests and
   woodlands grew in eastern North America. The open vegetation at 18,000
   C-14 yr BP was probably due to drier conditions and/or lower
   concentrations of atmospheric CO2.
   The composition and physical structure of biomes is not constant over
   time. Mid-Holocene biomes were similar in structure to those of today,
   but shifts in the relative importance of individual plant functional
   types are large enough that the physical properties of biomes, such as
   albedo, canopy conductance and surface roughness, are likely to have
   varied even during the Holocene. Last glacial maximum biomes were
   structurally different from their modern counterparts. The biome maps
   therefore may obscure significant vegetational changes in space and time
   during the late Quaternary.
   The difference between the highest and next highest affinity scores for
   each sample measures how strongly affinity scores discriminate among
   biomes. For many biomes, the difference is not large, and affinity score
   ties are not uncommon, highlighting the importance of tie-break
   procedures when using the biomization method.}},

Abstract = {{In Europe most conservation values, from biodiversity to scenic sites,
   are integral parts of agricultural landscapes. When these landscapes
   change as a result of agricultural policies, natural values - species,
   habitats, landscapes - are usually affected. Until recently however,
   these values have not been part of agricultural policies. The impacts of
   such new policies are difficult to evaluate because landscapes are
   complex and diverse, and the effects of policy are rarely immediate or
   causal.
   This paper evaluates the potential effects of Agri-environmental
   Regulation EC 2078/92 on European agricultural landscapes through the
   use of agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) on policy effects. After
   discussing the general framework of the evaluation methodology through
   the use of AEIs, we distinguish two types of agri-environmental policy
   (AEP) effects: policy performances and policy outcomes. The impediments
   to direct measurement of policy outcomes are stated. The potential for
   measuring policy performances are checked in two case study areas, one
   in Spain and one in Denmark, characterized by extensive agricultural
   land-uses and by the dual process of intensification/abandonment that is
   threatening their natural values. Both study areas are currently
   targeted by agri-environmental schemes under Reg. 2078/92. The
   realisability or availability of suitable statistical data to construct
   and report each AEI is stated for both types of effects. A problem of
   scale and content is found in most of the available statistics for
   assessing policy outcomes and the need for data at farm level is
   concluded to be indispensable if policy performances are to be measured.
   Effects of policy performance are measured for key selected AEIs in each
   study area on the basis of the results of a field survey based on
   questionnaires of participating and non-participating farmers in the AEP
   schemes. The main effects may be catalogued as improvement effects or
   protection effects since they represent a change in participant over
   non-participant farmers' decisions. Finally, the importance of this type
   of policy evaluation approach is discussed in the light of the likely
   future development of AEP in the European Union.}},

Abstract = {{Within the new array of `green' products and services, ecotourism claims
   to combine environmental responsibility with the generation of local
   economic benefits that will have both a development impact and serve as
   conservation incentives. Economic incentives are imperative for nature
   conservation, particularly in remote and ill-monitored regions where a
   weak presence of the state hinders the use of alternative tools of
   environmental regulation, In the following, the link between tourism,
   local benefits and conservation is conceptualised and analysed
   empirically, using data from the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve in the
   Ecuadorian Amazon region, near the border of Colombia and Peru. Three
   Cuyabeno indigenous groups have developed different modes of tourism
   participation, ranging from autonomous operations to pure salary
   employment. A quantification of local cash flows from tourism allows for
   a comparative analysis of income structure, spending, and the impacts on
   local development and on conservation attitudes. It is concluded that in
   the whole study area, tourism has actually provided significant
   additional income. Counter to common belief, the mode of participation
   is less decisive for local income generation than the tourist attraction
   of the natural site, the degree of tourism specialisation and the level
   of local organisation. However, as a conservation incentive, the
   effectiveness of tourism income-depends on the incentive structure
   inherent in the mode of participation, and on the substitution versus
   complementarity of other productive activities: only if tourism changes
   labour and land allocation decisions, will it have a local conservation
   impact. It is discussed under which circumstances the conjectured link
   between tourism, local incomes and conservation is likely to be
   effective. This leads to some general lessons for government policies,
   for the design of integrated conservation and development projects
   (ICDPs), and to a number of site-specific recommendations for improving
   incentive structures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Matrix population models require the population to be divided into
   discrete stage classes. In many cases, especially when classes are
   defined by a continuous variable, such as length or mass, there are no
   natural breakpoints, and the division is artificial. We introduce the
   ``integral projection model,{''} which eliminates the need for division
   into discrete classes, without requiring any additional biological
   assumptions. Like a traditional matrix model, the integral projection
   model provides estimates of the asymptotic growth rare, stable size
   distribution, reproductive values, and sensitivities of the growth rate
   to changes in vital rates. However, where the matrix model represents
   the size distributions, reproductive value, and sensitivities as step
   functions (constant within a stage class), the integral projection model
   yields smooth curves fur each of these as a function of individual size.
   We describe a method for fitting the model to data, and we apply this
   method to data on an endangered plant species, northern monkshood
   (Aconitum noveboracense). With individuals classified by stem diameter.
   The matrix and integral models yield similar estimates of the asymptotic
   growth rate, bur the reproductive values and sensitivities in the matrix
   model are sensitive to the choice of stage classes. The integral
   projection model avoids this problem and yields size-specific
   sensitivities that are not affected by stags duration. These general
   properties of the integral projection model will make it advantageous
   for other populations where there is no natural division of individuals
   into stage classes.}},

   the gradual process of autogenic succession. Forest composition during
   presettlement times was distinct at each site and included a variety of

   hardwood-Tsuga assemblages to assemblages dominated by early
   successional to mid-successional taxa such as Castanea, Quercus, and

Abstract = {{I studied the dynamic nature of old-growth, eastern U.S. forests by
   addressing the following questions: (1) How much do stand density, basal
   area, and size structure vary over rime within several old-growth
   remnants? (2) How do mortality and growth rates vary with stem size? (3)
   How much does the importance of individual species vary over time and
   space? (4) At what rate do snags and stumps form and deteriorate?
   In 1990-1991, I resampled canopy stems within several old-growth
   remnants in the southern Appalachians, in Hueston Woods State Park,
   Ohio, and in the Tionesta Scenic and Research Natural Areas,
   Pennsylvania. I had previously sampled those sites in 1976-1977 using
   the point-centered quarter method. I remeasured the same trees and
   measured new trees if the old ones had died or if a new stem closer to
   the point than the old stem for that quarter had grown to greater than
   or equal to 25 cm in diameter at breast height.
   Density and basal area changes were small. Density changes equaled
   -0.33\%, -0.52\%, and 0.00\%/yr for the southern Appalachians, Hueston
   Woods, and Tionesta sites, respectively. Corresponding basal-area
   changes were 0.03\%, -0.22\%, and 0.45\%/yr. Mortality increased
   consistently with stem size in all three areas. However, growth rates of
   smaller stems more than compensated for the higher mortality rates of
   larger sterns, so that overall stem size increased between samples. Most
   species changed little in relative density or basal area. Overall Fagus
   showed the largest changes between samples, with a small decrease in the
   southern Appalachians, a larger decrease in Hueston Woods, and an
   increase in Tionesta. Trees usually died standing, breaking off at a
   variety of heights. For example, only 6-27\% of trees that died were
   uprooted, depending on region, whereas 16-31\% broke at a height of
   greater than or equal to 16 m. Total snag densities were 15-18 snags/ha.
   In general these stands were marked by slow changes toward fewer, larger
   stems, even after centuries in which no major disturbances had occurred.
   However, changes in pathogens, climate, and atmospheric chemistry could
   change these trends in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Different levels of biodiversity - species, biotopes and landscapes -
   can be differentiated and used for the assessment of the biotic
   environment of organic farms. Could the integration of species diversity
   into the cultivated land be a task for organic farming in the future?
   For hundreds of years agriculture supported the enrichment and the
   diversification of the vegetation in Central Europe. Nowadays many
   landscape elements are no more than relies of historical land use.
   Todays' intensive agriculture is considered to be the main agent
   responsible for the decline of plant species, What are the effects of
   sustainable ways of agriculture on biodiversity, especially on the
   diversity of arable field plants? Many investigations show positive
   effects of organic agriculture on the diversity of arable fields and
   grassland, too. A higher number of species and also more endangered `red
   list' species are to be found in organic fields, Different effects of
   agricultural practices in organic fanning on the weed flora are
   discussed.
   Today economic pressure leads to an improvement in mechanical weed
   control and undersowing, This shows that the aim of preserving,
   supporting and developing a diverse arable field flora cannot be reached
   automatically by converting to organic fanning: an integration with the
   guiding image of organic agriculture is needed, Measures to support the
   richness of species of arable field plants in organic fields are shown.
   Many organic farmers are aware of correlations between an impoverished
   landscape and the appearance of pests and diseases and try to enrich the
   landscape with biotopes, Despite all the benefits of organic farming for
   nature the danger of separation arises in organic farming too: the
   separation of the landscape into 5\% `biotopes' where nature is allowed
   to develop and into 95\% `production area' being used intensively, One
   step further would be the development from separation to integration of
   biodiversity into the method of organic fanning as a whole - a way which
   corresponds with modern aims of the nature conservation movement. The
   `integrated table of landscape quality aspects' developed during the
   work of the concerted action `The Landscape and Nature Production
   Capacity of Organic/Sustainable Agriculture' could be useful for the
   assessment of organic farms under various aspects of biodiversity. It
   might help to change the farmers' viewpoint and make them assess their
   particular landscape values and their landscape components with new
   eyes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the role of tidal marshes in supporting estuarine nekton
   populations requires consideration of how different species and life
   stages use, and depend on, a variety of habitats. The problem might best
   be viewed from the perspective of a tidal marsh ecoscape, which relates
   variation in ecological interactions or processes to spatial patterns
   that emerge when associated marsh habitats are viewed together as a
   functional unit. Vegetated intertidal habitats, which define the salt
   marsh and account for most of its areal extent and productivity, are not
   used directly by most species of estuarine nekton in the southeastern
   U.S. If they function in the trophic support of these populations,
   marshes might supply dissolved nutrients to drive primary production in
   adjacent open waters or they could be a source of passively transported
   particles (i.e. drift) gathered by nekton from the water column or
   epibenthos. Alternatively, the few groups of nekton (mostly small marsh
   resident species) that feed within the marsh vegetation may actively
   translocate intertidal production horizontally across boundaries within
   the marsh ecoscape in a type of ``trophic relay{''}. Transfers to open
   estuarine waters may occur when material is either excreted in subtidal
   aquatic refugia at low tide, or accumulated biomass is passed along via
   predator-prey interactions. Temporal and spatial constraints on mobility
   and feeding behavior of nekton groups likely limit such production
   transfers to certain places and times, described as ``shifting
   interaction zones{''}. Identifying these interaction zones within the
   marsh ecoscape is a prerequisite for developing methods and sampling
   programs that will provide the type of. information needed to address
   long-standing issues involving the role of nekton in the ecology of
   estuaries and the functional contribution of marshes to estuarine

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{>1. The construction of a predictive metapopulation model includes three
   steps: the choice of factors affecting metapopulation dynamics, the
   choice of model structure, and finally parameter estimation and model
   testing.
   2. Unless the assumption is made that the metapopulation is at
   stochastic quasi-equilibrium and unless the method of parameter
   estimation of model parameters uses that assumption, estimates from a
   limited amount of data will usually predict a trend in metapopulation
   size.
   3. This implicit estimation of a trend occurs because
   extinction-colonization stochasticity, possibly amplified by regional
   stochasticity, leads to unequal numbers of observed extinction and
   colonization events during a short study period.
   4. Metapopulation models, such as those based on the logistic regression
   model, that rely on observed population turnover events in parameter
   estimation are sensitive to the implicit estimation of a trend.
   5. A new parameter estimation method, based on Monte Carlo inference for
   statistically implicit models, allows an explicit decision about whether
   metapopulation quasi-stability is assumed or not.
   6. Our confidence in metapopulation model parameter estimates that have
   been produced from only a few years of data is decreased by the need to
   know before parameter estimation whether the metapopulation is in
   quasi-stable state or not.
   7. The choice of whether metapopulation stability is assumed or not in
   parameter estimation should be done consciously. Typical data sets cover
   only a few years and rarely allow a statistical test of a possible
   trend. While making the decision about stability one should consider any
   information about the landscape history and species and metapopulation
   characteristics.}},

Pages = {{289-296}},
Abstract = {{Empirical and theoretical determinations of minimum threshold prey
   densities for filter-feeding basking sharks Cetorhinus maximus were used
   to test the idea that threshold foraging behaviour could provide a means
   for estimating oxygen consumption (a proxy for metabolic rate). The
   threshold leeding level represents the prey density at which there will
   be no net energy gain (energy intake equals expenditure). Basking sharks
   were observed to cease feeding at their theoretical threshold; thus, the
   assumption underpinning the concept presented here was that over the
   narrow range of zooplankton prey densities that induce `switching'
   between feeding and non-feeding in basking sharks, the energetic value
   of the minimum threshold prey density is equivalent to the shark's
   instantaneous level of energy expenditure. Four independent estimates of
   the lower threshold prey density obtained for C, maximus in the English
   Channel were converted to equivalent rates of oxygen consumption. Best
   estimates ranged from 62.5 to 91.1 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) (mean, 80.7 mg
   O-2 kg(-1) h(-1), +/- 20.1 {[}95 \%, confidence interval, CI]) for a
   shark of 5 m total body length (L-T) weighing 1000 kg. Sensitivity
   analysis using `low' and `high' possible values in the model for mouth
   gape area, proportion of prey filtered, buccal flow velocity, prey
   energy content and energy absorption, yielded low and high rates of 23.2
   and 192.1 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1), respectively. Varying estimated body mass
   of 1000 kg in the model by +/- 200 kg gave an oxygen consumption range
   of 67.2 to 100.8 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1); a range within the 95 \% CI of the
   best estimate mean. For comparison, a new routine oxygen
   consumption-body mass relationship was determined for sharks body mass
   range, 0.35 to 140 kg) and was described by the equation VO2 =
   0.30M(0.84), where VO2 is oxygen consumption in mg O-2 h(-1) and M is
   mass in grams. When corrected for likely energy costs associated with
   filter-feeding, this relationship and 2 other metabolic rate scaling
   relationships in the Literature gave expected rates between 52.0 and
   99.2 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) for a fish of 1000 kg body mass. The
   threshold-converted and expected oxygen consumption values although
   derived from different methods show good agreement, an observation that
   warrants further investigation. To verify the concept it will be
   necessary to obtain threshold-converted rates of oxygen consumption from
   a wide size range of basking sharks (1.5 to 10.0 m L-T) to determine
   whether rates scale predictably with body mass as does actual
   metabolism.}},

   light distribution. This concept thus allows us to build a functional
   representation of the distribution of the photosynthetically active
   biomass in the sediment and, by then integrating the light and
   temperature forcing of the latter biomass, to predict the dynamics of
   the whole epipelic community on short-term time scales. The model then
   clearly reveals an oscillatory behavior of the total biomass at the
   surface of the sediment, consistent with field biomass daily
   measurements performed during a spring-neap tidal cycle. Biomass
   increases occur during the diurnal emersion phase, in alternation with
   decreases during the submersion and nocturnal emersion phases; the
   dynamics of intertidal microphytobenthos is thus controlled by the
   night/day cycle and tidal hydrodynamic forcing, which determines the
   fast changes in environmental conditions (light and nutrient
   availability, temperature) which epipelic microalgae experience. The
   similarity between model simulations and field observations leads us to
   conclude that the conceptual framework of the model is valid.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the evolution of delayed, size-dependent reproduction in the
   monocarpic perennial Onopordum illyricum, using a range of mathematical
   models, parameterized with long-term field data. Analysis of the
   long-term data indicated that mortality, flowering, and growth were age
   and size dependent. Using mixed models, we estimated the variance about
   each of these relationships and also individual-specific effects. For
   the held populations, recruitment was the main density-dependent
   process, although there were weak effects of local density on growth and
   mortality Using parameterized growth models, which assume plants grow
   along a deterministic trajectory, we predict plants should flower at
   sizes approximately 50\% smaller than observed in the field. We then
   develop a simple criterion, termed the ``1-yr look-ahead criterion,{''}
   based on equating seed production now with that of next year, allowing
   for mortality and growth, to determine at what size a plant should
   flower. This model allows the incorporation of variance about the growth
   function and individual-specific effects. The model predicts flowering
   at sizes approximately double that observed, indicating that variance
   about the growth curve selects for larger sizes at flowering. The 1-yr
   look-ahead approach is approximate because it ignores growth
   opportunities more than 1 yr ahead. To assess the accuracy of this
   approach, we develop a more complicated dynamic state variable model.
   Both models give similar results indicating the utility of the 1-yr
   look-ahead criterion. To allow for temporal variation in the model
   parameters, we used an individual-based model with a generic algorithm.
   This gave very accurate prediction of the observed flowering strategies.
   Sensitivity analysis of the model suggested that temporal variation in
   the parameters of the growth equation made waiting to flower more risky,
   so selected for smaller sizes at flowering. The models clearly indicate
   the need to incorporate stochastic variation in life-history analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of base cations from forest soils can be accelerated by acid rain,

   Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire (USA), we analyzed
   samples collected on seven dates between 1976 and 1997. Calcium and
   magnesium contents of the forest floor did not decline significantly; a
   change >0.9\%/yr would have been detectable. Concentrations of Ca were
   40\% higher in 1969-1970 than in the current study, but the difference
   is partly due to changes in collection methods. Magnesium concentrations
   were too variable to detect a loss of <47\% over the 21-yr interval. Td
   determine whether base-cation losses were associated with forest growth,
   we resampled a chronosequence of northern hardwood stands in the White
   Mountains of New Hampshire. The 13 stands did not show consistent
   changes in Ca, Mg, and potassium over the 15-yr interval. Losses of
   these cations were most pronounced in stands logged more than 25 yr
   earlier. Younger stands, contrary to our expectation that rapid forest
   growth should cause cation depletion, all gained base cations in the
   forest Boor Early in stand development these forest floors appeared to
   accumulate biomass along with living vegetation, rather than serving as
   a net source of nutrients. Finally, in a regional survey of 28 mature
   stands in the northeastern United States, some lost significant
   forest-floor Ca and Mg between 1980 and 1990, while others gained. The
   average change in Ca and Mg content was not significant; a loss of
   1.4\%/yr would have been detectable. Forest Boors in the region are not
   currently experiencing rapid losses of base cations, though losses may
   have preceeded the onset of these three studies.}},

Abstract = {{1. Environmental change and impact continue to create a major need for
   the application of ecology. We attempted to ascertain whether authors in
   the Journal of Applied Ecology made relevant contributions at
   appropriate spatio-temporal scales to the problems that result.
   2. A review of 84 papers published in the Journal during 1999 indicated
   that all carried information of direct value in environmental
   management, and 46\% made explicit management recommendations.
   3. The techniques used most frequently by applied ecologists were
   correlational (48\% of all papers; including ordination) or anova-style
   comparisons between replicated locations that were either purposely
   manipulated or contrasted on a priori criteria (38\%). Models (13\%),
   laboratory experiments, mark-recapture studies and observational work -
   involving for example stable isotopes - also figured. This breadth
   reveals how classical and novel approaches in ecology are brought to
   bear on real environmental problems. The journal continues to publicise
   innovative new techniques with applied relevance.
   4. In keeping with the widespread use of correlation and a priori
   contrasts, 34\% of published studies in 1999 involved time scales
   exceeding > 5-10 years. Similarly, 40\% of studies approached problems
   in large, regional contexts. Applied ecologists are clearly providing
   leadership in developing methods to tackle challenging questions at
   spatio-temporal scales beyond the capabilities of manipulative
   ecological experiments. We will augment this area of the Journal's work
   with a special issue on large-scale processes in 2000.
   5. Only 20\% of the papers published explicitly state clearly testable
   hypotheses, but nearly all state clear aims or questions being
   addressed.
   6. Overwhelmingly, papers approach applied ecology by seeking to assess
   the effects of anthropogenic factors on ecological systems, and a
   minority assess the effects of organisms on human activity. Few studies,
   by contrast, use anthropogenic impacts to test or develop ecological
   theory. We suggest this is an area ripe for development.
   7. Points 2, 3 and 4 above demonstrate how the Journal of Applied
   Ecology communicates the value and utility of ecology to society at
   large. We prompt leading ecologists to maintain their involvement with
   the application of ecology to problem solving. We urge authors to
   emphasize further the generic value in their work. We predict that
   applied ecology will continue as a vital tool in detecting ecological
   problems and informing environmental management. It will emerge also as
   an arena for advancing the fundamental nature of our discipline.}},

Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{2-3}},
Pages = {{73-89}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Spatially explicit individual-based models (IBMs) use movement rules to
   determine when an animal departs its current location and to determine
   its movement destination; these rules are therefore critical to accurate
   simulations. Movement rules typically define some measure of how an
   individual's expected fitness varies among locations, under the
   assumption that animals make movement decisions at least in part to
   increase their fitness. Recent research shows that many fish move
   quickly in response to changes in physical and biological conditions, so
   movement rules should allow fish to rapidly select the best location
   that is accessible. The theory that a fish's fitness is maximized by
   minimizing the ratio of mortality risk to food intake is not applicable
   to typical IBM movement decisions and can cause serious errors in common
   situations. Instead, we developed fitness measures from unified foraging
   theory that are theoretically and computationally compatible with
   individual-based fish models. One such fitness measure causes a fish to
   select habitat that maximizes its expected probability of survival over
   a specified time horizon, considering both starvation and other risks.
   This fitness measure is dependent on the fish's current state, making
   fish with low energy reserves more willing to accept risks in exchange
   for higher food intake. Another new measure represents the expectation
   of reaching reproductive maturity by multiplying expected survival by a
   factor indicating how close to the size of first reproduction the fish
   grows within the time horizon. One of the primary benefits of the
   individual-based approach is avoiding the need for simplifying
   assumptions; this benefit is best realized by basing movement decisions
   on such simple, direct measures of fitness as expected survival and
   expected reproductive maturity. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{1. A Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) has been developed as a new
   feature of the NASA-CASA (Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach) ecosystem
   production and trace gas model. This DGVM includes seasonal phenology
   algorithms calibrated using historical interannual data sets derived
   from the Advanced Very High Resolution (AVHRR) satellite `greenness'
   index.
   2. The coupled CASA-DGVM design is based conceptually on two main
   elements of Tilman's resource-ratio hypothesis of vegetation change,
   namely: 1) plant competition for resources (water and light) over
   relatively short time periods of months and seasons; and 2) the
   long-term pattern in the supply of growth-limiting resources such as
   water and nutrients, i.e. the resource-supply trajectory. This
   simulation model generates global gridded estimates of primary
   production, above and below ground biomass, leaf area index (LAI), and
   trace gas fluxes from soil.
   3. Eight distributed rest locations for the DGVM were evaluated
   initially to represent a variety of climate conditions ranging from
   Arctic (64 degrees N Alaska) to tropical and subtropical (24 degrees S
   southern Africa) latitude zones. At all test locations, the predicted
   plant functional type (PFT) matched closely with the actual reported
   PFT.
   4. In the process of running the model to steady state PFTs, most forest
   locations showed a rapid progression of transient stales, from bare
   ground to grassland, to grasses with shrub cover, and finally to the
   forest PFT. From this first global application. the DGVM correctly
   predicts the presence of forest classes in approximately 75-95\% of all
   cases worldwide, and grasslands in approximately 58\% of all cases.
   5. The effects of two hypothetical climate change scenarios were
   evaluated. Scenario I was set by warming air surface temperatures
   linearly to 4 degrees C above average over a 25-year simulation period.
   Scenario II was set by decreasing annual rainfall amounts linearly to
   50\% below average over a 25-year simulation period.
   6. The warming scenario I resulted in PFT at high latitude forest and
   boreal forest sites changing to mixed coniferous forest, accompanied by
   increase in canopy LAI. The drought scenario II resulted in PFT at the
   boreal forest and savanna sites changing to grasslands. At locations
   where PFT did not change with climate, however, soil water and canopy
   LAI were predicted to decline progressively under the warming scenario,
   beginning from steady-state temperate and tropical zone PFTs. They also
   declined under the drought scenario beginning from practically any
   steady slate PFT.}},

Abstract = {{The US. Endangered Species Act (ESA) mandates that recovery plans
   include specific criteria to determine when a species should be removed
   from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. To meet this
   mandate, we developed a new approach to determining classification
   criteria for long-lived vertebrates The key idea is that endangerment
   depends on two critical aspects of a population: population size and
   trends in population size due to intrinsic variability in population
   growth rates. The way to combine these features is to identify a
   population size and range of population growth rates (where lambda
   denotes the annual multiplicative rate of change of a population) above
   which there is a negligible probability of extinction. To do so, (1)
   information on the current population size and its variance is
   specified; (2) available information on vital rates or changes in
   abundance over time is used to generate a probability distribution for
   the population's lambda; (3) the lower fifth percentile value for lambda
   (denoted as lambda((0.05)))is obtained from the frequency distribution
   of lambda s and (4) if lambda((0.05)) is <1.0, a backwards population
   trajectory starting at 500 individuals for a period of 10 years is
   performed and the resulting population size is designated as the
   threshold for listing a species as endangered, or if lambda((0.05)) is
   greater than or equal to 1.0, the threshold for endangerment is set at
   500 animals. A similar approach can be used to determine the threshold
   for listing a species as threatened under the ESA. We applied this
   approach to North Pacific humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and
   used Monte Carlo simulations to produce a frequency distribution of
   lambda s for the whales under three different scenarios. Using
   lambda((0.05)) it was determined that the best estimates of current
   abundance for the central population of North Pacific humpback whales
   were larger than the estimated threshold for endangered status but less
   than the estimated threshold for threatened status if accepted by the
   responsible management agency this analysis would be consistent with a
   recommendation to downlist the central stock of humpback whales to a
   status of threatened, whereas the status of eastern and western stocks
   would remain endangered.}},

Abstract = {{The study of vegetation response to environmental change on a global

   beyond the scale of the floristic region, models have to rely on
   vegetation descriptions using plant types other than the species. The
   crucial problem is how to define the types. Since types are described by
   traits, the problem translates into one of optimal trait selection. The
   best plant traits are those that when used to define plant types
   optimize the perception of association between vegetation and
   environmental (e.g., climate, disturbance) variation. I consider trait
   selection as a two-step procedure. The first step is the selection of a
   larger trait set based on past experience and known practicality, which
   is used for community description. The second step, for which the paper
   describes new methods, is accomplished on the data analytically by
   suitable computer algorithms that can find the optimal subset among the
   pre selected traits. This subset defines optimal plant functional types
   (PFTs). The methods involve a fuzzy set approach and community
   description by plant types. The optimization algorithms described are

Abstract = {{Satellite data provide the basis for geographically referenced global
   land cover characterization that is internally consistent, repeatable

   During the last 20 years considerable research efforts have been devoted
   to the extraction of land cover information from these data. Only during
   the last few years have these methods begun to be applied in operational
   contexts. Such applications have thus far primarily addressed key global
   change issues such as the global carbon balance. Examples of the
   successful quasi-operational implementation of remote sensing include
   NASA's Humid Tropical Landsat Pathfinder project, where high resolution
   data are being used at subcontinental scales to measure change in the
   areal extent of tropical rain forests throughout the world, and the
   Tropical Ecosystem Environment observation by Satellite (TREES) project
   to assess forest cover in the tropics. At coarser resolutions, a number
   of land cover products suitable for incorporation in global and regional
   models have been developed. Alternatives to traditional land cover
   classifications have also been developed to describe gradients and
   mosaics in the vegetation more realistically. These land cover products
   offer the possibility for applications in ecological and human
   dimensions research at regional and global scales, as well as for
   implementation of international agreements that require land cover
   information. Recently launched and future satellites will carry sensors
   that provide data with greatly improved capabilities for land cover
   characterization and advancements in computing environments make it
   feasible to take advantage of these new data. However, several
   challenges must be overcome in making a transition from research to
   operational land cover monitoring, including automation of methods to
   analyse the satellite data, more effective techniques for validation,
   and assurance of long-term continuity in the availability of satellite
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The community composition of benthic macroinvertebrates from 295
   estuarine sires was examined in order to either confirm or challenge
   established boundaries of zoogeographical provinces. We also
   investigated the postulate that, while local distributions were
   determined by natural habitat characteristics such as salinity, sediment
   type and depth, distributions on a large geographical scale would bt:
   correlated with temperature.
   Location The Atlantic coast of the United States (on a latitudinal
   gradient from 42 degrees to 25 degrees N).
   Methods Using the descriptive techniques of cluster analysis and
   nonmetric multidimensional scaling, we determined the similarities in
   benthic community composition between sites within 1 degrees latitudinal
   bands and compared the biotic ordinations to natural habitat
   characteristics such as salinity, sediment type and depth. We then
   evaluated the overall community composition within each 1 degrees
   latitudinal band and established whether or not similarities existed
   between adjacent 1 degrees latitudinal bands. In this manner, we were
   able to confirm that a latitudinal gradient existed in estuarine benthic
   community composition along the western Atlantic coast. This latitudinal
   gradient was demarcated by biogeographical boundaries at (1) Biscayne
   Bay, Florida, (2) the southern end of the Indian River Lagoon, Florida,
   (3) St John's River, Florida, (4) Cape Island, South Carolina, (5) the
   mouth of the Cape Fear River, North Carolina. and (6) Caps God,
   Massachusetts, with 3 subprovince boundary just north of Cape May at
   Wildwood, New Jersey.
   Results The major divisions approximated widely recognized
   biogeographical boundaries. Average summer water temperatures correlated
   better than sediment type, depth, or salinity with the latitudinal
   groupings of sites determined by cluster analysis.
   Conclusions Based on this relationship, we speculate on the potential
   impacts of current global climate change scenarios on the distribution

Abstract = {{Aim During the last decades, an increasing number of studies have
   stressed the importance of historical human influence on the ecology of
   forests and on the characteristics of forest soils. Therefore, the
   Objectives of this study are (1) the quantification of the laud use
   history of Ename Wood from 1278 to 1990 and (2) tu find out whether the
   former land use of the forest has long-lasting effects on present-day
   chemical soil properties.
   Location The 62-ha present-jay Ename Wood is situated in western Belgium
   and is the remainder of the 145-ha historical Ename Wood.
   Methods We disposed of eighteen laud-use maps for the period between
   1278 and 1990 which were digitized using a geographic information system
   (GIS). Transition between thc different land uses and Shannon-Wiener
   diversity indices were calculated to quantify the history of changing
   laud use. Mixed soil samples were taken in lots delimited on the basis
   of the historical data. Next, the soil properties were combined with the
   land-use variables using redundancy analysis and ANOVA.
   Results The quantification of the land use changes showed that the
   present Ename Wood is the result of several forest regression and
   progression phases, with a complete clearance in thr nineteenth century.
   Diversity in land use was maximal between the fourteenth and the
   sixteenth century due a variety of transitional forms between forest and
   pasture. A positive correlation between the duration of arable land use
   since the 19th century clearance and soil pH, calcium and phosphate
   content was observed and a negative correlation was found with the
   carbon content, the total nitrogen content and the C:N ratio. These
   correlations are probably caused by;1 combination of acidification
   processes and the accumulation of organic matter under forest in
   combination with manuring practices in the twentieth century.
   Present-dal: forest lots which have been pastured for some time between
   1278 and nineteenth-century clearance still had a significantly lower pH
   and degree of base saturation, which is probably caused by the export of
   nutrient rich plant material at that time.
   Discussion and conclusions The results demonstrate that the developed
   methodology is successful and confirm that historical land use, even in
   the distant past, can still influence present-day soil characteristics.
   For this reason, long-term historical land use should always be
   considered in forest ecological research.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of invertebrate biomass isa critical step in addressing many
   ecological questions in aquatic environments. Length-dry mass
   regressions are the most widely used approach for estimating benthic
   invertebrate biomass because they are faster and more precise than other
   methods. A compilation and analysis of length-mass regressions using the
   power model, M (mass) = a L (length)(b), are presented from 30 y of data
   collected by the authors, primarily from the southeastern USA, along
   with published regressions from the rest of North America. A total of
   442 new and published regressions are presented, mostly for genus or
   species, based on total body length or other linear measurements. The
   regressions include 64 families of aquatic insects and 12 families of
   other invertebrate groups (mostly molluscs and crustaceans). Regressions
   were obtained for 134 insect genera (155 species) and 153 total
   invertebrate genera (184 species). Regressions are provided for both
   body length and head width for some taxa. In some cases, regressions are
   provided from multiple localities for single taxa. When using body
   length in the equations, there were no significant differences in the
   mean value of the exponent b among 8 insect orders or Amphipoda. The
   mean value of b for insects was 2.79, ranging from only 2.69 to 2.91
   among orders. The mean value of b for Decapoda (3.63), however, was
   significantly higher than all insects orders and amphipods. Mean values
   of a were not significantly different among the 8 insect orders and
   Amphipoda, reflecting considerable variability within orders. Reasons
   for potential differences in b among taxa are explained with
   hypothetical examples showing how b responds to changes in linear
   dimensions and specific gravity. When using head width as the linear
   dimension in the power model the mean value of b was higher (3.11) than
   for body length and more variable among orders (2.8-3.3). Values of b
   for Ephemeroptera (3.3) were significantly higher than those for
   Odonata, Megaloptera, and Diptera. For those equations in which ash-free
   dry mass was used, \% ash varied considerably among functional feeding
   groups (3.3-12.4\%). Percent ash varied from 4.0\% to 8.5\% among major
   insect orders, but was 18.9\% for snails (without shells). Family-level
   regressions also are presented so that they can be used when generic
   equations are unavailable or when organisms are only identified to the
   family level. It is our intention that these regressions be used by
   others in estimating mass from linear dimensions but potential errors
   must be recognized.}},

   of saltmarshes:by nekton is poor, with even the most influential works
   suffering from obvious limitations. Attempts to generalize about nekton
   use of saltmarshes are hampered by sampling difficulties, poor sampling
   design, and inconsistent reporting of flooding regime and landscape
   structure. The difficulty in sampling; nekton from shallow, vegetated
   marsh flats while inundated contributes to the fragmentary results of
   nekton work. A range of sampling methods have been described that vary
   in portability, size, amount of above-ground structure, escape rates of

   design in studies of saltmarsh nekton includes lack of replication,
   limited spatial scale, and lack of baseline data before management
   changes are made. Attempts to determine effects on commercial fisheries
   of losses in area or quality of saltmarsh by correlations between catch
   data and marsh loss should use active adaptive management. A second type
   of study, aimed at understanding how the saltmarsh is important to
   fisheries, can be tackled usefully at a smaller scale. To assist in the
   comparison of results from different studies, flooding regime should be
   reported as a proportion of time the marsh is submerged, and landscape
   structure as proportions of the marsh that are covered by intertidal
   flats, pools and drainage creeks. Flooding regime and landscape

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{A current paradigm in conservation biology is that forest harvest
   practices that better approximate natural disturbance processes are more
   likely to conserve biodiversity. We contrasted bird communities in three
   replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following
   wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were
   chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having greater than
   or equal to 95\% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested
   sites retaining an average of 6\% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For
   all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird
   abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment
   types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five
   major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and
   harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified
   similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities
   occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of
   communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance.
   Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats
   were associated primarily with I-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed
   Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P.
   arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or
   nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in
   avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on
   postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were
   apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete
   convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry
   practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood
   forest. Notably, Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Brown Creeper
   (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), and American
   Robin (Turdus migratorius) had higher densities on postwildfire than on
   postharvest stands. Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), Alder
   Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina),
   Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Redstart (Setophaga
   rutticilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Rose-breasted
   Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludoviciana), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis),
   and Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) had higher densities on postharvest
   stands, possibly due to the greater abundance, after harvest, of larger
   live residual trees and a taller and more dense shrub layer. Harvest
   designed to approximate stand-replacing fires may require the retention
   of more snags than is currently practiced. New approaches to fire
   salvage logging are also required to ensure adequate retention of
   standing dead trees on the landscape.}},

Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1568-1583}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{One of the ultimate goals of ecosystem carbon dioxide (COL) experiments
   is to infer the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to sequester carbon
   (C) in a CO2-enriched world. This modeling study examines C
   sequestration (C-seq) in natural ecosystems based on CO2 experiments.
   Most experiments are conducted by a step increase in CO2 concentration,
   whereas natural ecosystems are experiencing a gradual increase in
   atmospheric CO2 (C-a). To examine the effects of a step vs. gradual CO2
   increase on ecosystem responses: we have developed a terrestrial C
   sequestration (TCS) model that focuses on C and nitrogen (N)
   interactions in regulating C-seq. We used the model to: (1) compare
   C-seq and N demand in response to the step vs, gradual increase in CO2;
   (2) identify mechanisms underlying different ecosystem responses to the
   step vs. gradual CO2 forcing; (3) examine key parameters in controlling
   C-seq and (4) explore three hypothesized N supply mechanisms in
   regulating photosynthetic acclimation and C-seq.
   Application of this model to simulate responses of a forest ecosystem
   with gross primary productivity of 1200 g C.m(-2).yr(-1) suggested that
   a step increase in CO2 from 350 to 700 ppm resulted in C-seq of 263 g
   C.m(-2).yr(-1) in the first year. A gradual C-a increase led to the
   C-seq rates of 27 and 58 g C.m(-2).yr(-1) in 1987 and 2085 when CO2
   reached 350 and 700 ppm, respectively. The model predicted that N demand
   required to balance the additional C influx was 4.1 g N.m(-2).yr(-1) in
   the step CO2 increase and only 0.6 and 1.7 g N.m(-2).yr(-1) in 1987 and
   2085, respectively, in the gradual C-a increase. The contrasting
   differences in C-seq and N demand between the two increase scenarios
   reflected the nature of C fluxes that were controlled by the sizes of
   donor pools (i.e., donor-controlled system). Our modeling analysis of
   four ecosystems (forest with high productivity {[}HP]; grassland with
   HP; forest with low productivity {[}LP]; and grassland with LP)
   indicated that additional C influx and C relaxation time are the key
   parameters in determining ecosystem C-seq. The additional C influx
   varied with ecosystem productivity and N regulation, while C relaxation
   time differed between the forests and grasslands due to woody tissues
   and litter in the forests. We conclude that in spite of the fact that
   the step experiment is one of the most effective approaches in ecosystem
   studies, its results cannot be directly extrapolated to predict
   terrestrial C-seq in natural ecosystems responding to a gradual C-a
   increase. In order to develop predictive understanding from the: step
   experiments, we need not only to improve experimental design and
   measurement plans, but also to develop new approaches, such as
   deconvolution and inverse modeling, for data analysis and
   interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a regional-historical approach to the interpretation,
   conservation, and management of pitch pine-scrub oak (PPSO) communities
   in the Connecticut Valley of Massachusetts. Historical studies, aerial
   photographs, GIS analyses, and extensive field sampling are used to (a)
   document changes in the historical distribution, composition, and
   dynamics of these communities, and (b) evaluate the importance of
   regional-historical approaches to understanding, conserving, and
   managing uncommon communities. At the time of European settlement, pine
   plains dominated by both pitch and white pine were widespread, occurring
   on 9000 ha or more of the extensive (approximately 32,000 ha) xeric
   outwash deposits in the Connecticut Valley. Pine plains were harvested
   for diverse forest products from the 17th to the early 19th centuries.
   After 1830, most sites were cleared and plowed for agriculture and then
   abandoned in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, resulting in
   widespread natural reforestation. Modern PPSO communities differ from
   historical communities with respect to landscape distribution,
   composition, and structure. Nearly all modern pitch pine stands in the
   Connecticut Valley became established on former agricultural fields.
   Current vegetation on these former fields differs substantially from
   those few sites that were never plowed. Ln particular, several species
   (for example, Gaultheria procumbens, Gaylussacia baccata, Quercus
   ilicifolia, and Q. prinoides) that are characteristic of unplowed sites
   have not successfully colonized former fields in the 50 to more than 100
   years since agricultural abandonment. Urban, commercial, and residential
   development have been widespread in the 20th century. By 1985, only
   38.6\% of the outwash deposits remained forested, and only 1094 ha of
   pitch pine stands and 74 ha of scrub oak stands occurred, primarily in
   numerous small patches. Several stands have been destroyed since 1985,
   and development threatens all remaining sites. The trend towards rapid
   urban development in the 20th century makes it increasingly urgent that
   the few, relatively large, undeveloped sites be protected. Our results
   suggest that (a) land protection efforts should prioritize large,
   undeveloped sand plains, areas that were not plowed historically, and
   reestablishment of contiguity between isolated sites to facilitate
   colonization of former agricultural lands by sand plain species; (b)
   management of PPSO communities should not be restricted to maintenance
   of open barrens; ``old-growth{''} pitch and white pine stands occurred
   historically, and some PPSO communities should be allowed to mature
   without frequent disturbance; (c) the exclusive use of prescribed fires
   during the spring months is unlikely to maintain communities similar to
   modern ones or to restore communities similar to historical ones.
   Establishment or maintenance of open barrens species and communities may
   require more varied disturbance regimes, perhaps including mechanical
   treatment in combination with prescribed fire to simulate severe summer
   fires; (d) regional-historical perspectives are critical for
   understanding modern community dynamics and for evaluating conservation
   objectives and management strategies for uncommon plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{We studied microbial community composition in a primary successional
   chronosequence on the forefront of Lyman Glacier, Washington, United
   States. We sampled microbial communities in soil from nonvegetated areas
   and under the canopies of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants from 20-
   to 80-year-old zones along the successional gradient, Three independent
   measures of microbial biomass were used: substrate-induced respiration
   (SIR), phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, and direct microscopic
   counts. All methods indicated that biomass increased over successional
   time in the nonvegetated soil. PLFA analysis indicated that the
   microbial biomass was greater under the plant canopies than in the
   nonvegetated soils; the microbial community composition was clearly
   different between these two types of soils. Over the successional
   gradient, the microbial community shifted from bacterial-dominated to
   fungal-dominated. Microbial respiration increased while specific
   activity (respiration per unit biomass) decreased in nonvegetated soils
   over the successional gradient. We proposed and evaluated new parameters

   added. These, as well as the corresponding specific activities
   (calculated as Max and Acc per unit biomass), decreased sharply over the
   successional gradient. Our study suggests that during the early stages
   of succession the microbial community cannot incorporate all the added
   substrate into its biomass, but rapidly increases its respiration. The
   later-stage microbial community cannot reach as high a rate of
   respiration per unit biomass but remains in an ``energy-saving

Abstract = {{Three apple pest-management regimes are being compared for their
   ecological impacts, and their ability to ensure the economic production
   of high-quality apples. Species diversity, pest status and fruit quality
   are being evaluated under: (i) conventional, (ii) integrated, and (iii)
   biological fruit production systems. The conventional system follows
   current export orchard practices with broad-spectrum pesticides, and the
   integrated system uses a wider range of control methods, including
   minimal spray applications, preferably of selective pesticides. The
   biological system uses mating disruption for codling moth (at one site),
   Bacillus thuringiensis for leafrollers, copper/slaked lime for diseases,
   and matting or mulches for weed control.
   Conventional production results in few insects being present during the
   season and Little damage at harvest, but increasing insecticide
   resistance problems and changing market requirements put the
   sustainability of this system in doubt. In the integrated system,
   excellent control of Lepidoptera has been achieved using tebufenozide,
   with little effect on natural enemies. Further development of the system
   is needed, but the economics appear favourable for producing
   export-quality fruit in future. In the biological system, the lack of
   effective controls for key quarantine pests limits economic
   sustainability and largely restricts production to the local market. The
   future of this system for export production depends on innovative
   technology to overcome these problems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Volume = {{80}},

Pages = {{429-442}},

Abstract = {{The possibility that different species assemblages may represent
   persistent alternative community states remains largely unexplored by
   experimental ecologists because of a variety of conceptual and
   experimental problems. We discuss some of the conceptual roadblocks to
   experimentation and propose several avenues for attacking the problem
   experimentally. We address the conceptual issues involved in (1) the
   blurring of the distinction between the processes that initiate the
   switch among alternative states and the positive-feedback processes that
   maintain those states, and (2) the role of spatial scale in initiating
   the switch.
   We suggest that the switch between alternative states requires, first, a
   disturbance that removes species involved in the positive feedbacks
   needed for maintenance and, second, the arrival of other individuals
   that initiate the switch to the alternative assemblage. The removal of
   the species that maintain the system must be large enough and over a
   long enough time to allow the arrival and establishment of members of
   the alternative assemblage, and so we hypothesize that the switch among
   alternative states is scale dependent.
   This scenario suggests that the switch among alternative states can be
   investigated experimentally through the manipulation of the scale of the
   disturbance and of the arrival of members of the alternative state.
   Small-scale disturbances should consistently fail to initiate a switch,
   while larger-scale events should initiate a switch at least part of the
   time. We also note that in some cases the scale of disturbance and/or
   the arrival of recruits cannot be manipulated or controlled and suggest
   that several approaches other than factorial experiments with ANOVA,
   such as spatial autocorrelation methods, may be useful.
   We illustrate the potential and the difficulties of various approaches
   by discussing two systems in eastern North America that may contain
   alternative states. Mosaics of mussel beds and algal beds occupy rocky
   coasts from New England northward, and patchworks of forests and
   heathlands occur in eastern Canada and in the Appalachian highlands.
   While the study of alternative states in the marine system can be
   approached experimentally, the scale of disturbance required to switch
   forests to heathlands is too large for experimentation and must rely on
   the use of other approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of habitat use by breeding birds were studied in cottonwood
   riparian forests along 100 km of the South Fork of the Snake River in
   southeastern Idaho, United States, from 1991 to 1994. A hierarchical
   approach was used to examine habitat use at three spatial scales:
   microhabitat (local vegetation characteristics), macrohabitat
   (cottonwood forest patch characteristics), and landscape (composition
   and patterning of surrounding {[}matrix] vegetation types and land
   uses). This paper addresses a series of predictions about species'
   distributions that incorporate the different spatial scales. Bird
   distribution and abundance and vegetation data were collected on 57
   cottonwood forest patches ranging in size from 0.40 ha to 205 ha. The
   surrounding landscape changed from a valley surrounded by mountains, on
   the upstream end of the study area, to a narrow canyon adjacent to
   natural upland vegetation in the middle section, and to a wide, open
   floodplain dominated by agriculture on the downstream end. The best
   predictors of high species richness (r(2) = 0.71) were natural and
   heterogeneous landscapes, large cottonwood patches, close proximity to
   other cottonwood patches, and microhabitats with relatively open
   canopies. Distribution and frequency of occurrence were evaluated for 32
   species of small land birds. The most frequent significant predictor of
   species occurrence was the landscape component: increases in upland
   natural vegetation with decreases in agriculture. Both interior and edge
   specialists were found in arid land, cottonwood riparian forests that
   are linear in nature, with large amounts of edge. Nest predators, brood
   parasites, and exotic species responded positively to human-altered
   landscapes. Landscape patterns were the primary influence on
   distribution and occurrence of most bird species, whereas macrohabitat
   and microhabitat were of secondary importance. Thus, surrounding
   landscape (matrix) features should be a primary consideration for
   selecting riparian reserve areas.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews two decades of effort by the scientific community in
   a search for predictive understanding of plant responses to elevated
   {[}CO2]. To evaluate the progress of research in leaf photosynthesis,
   plant respiration, root nutrient uptake, and carbon partitioning, we
   divided scientific activities into four phases: (I) initial assessments
   derived from our existing knowledge base to provide frameworks for
   experimental studies; (II) experimental tests of the initial
   assessments; (III) in cases where assessments were invalidated,
   synthesis of experimental results to stimulate alternative hypotheses
   and further experimentation; and (IV) formation of new knowledge. This
   paper suggests that photosynthetic research may have gone through all
   four phases, considering that (a) variable responses of photosynthesis
   to {[}CO2] are generally explainable, (b) extrapolation of leaf-level
   studies to the global scale has been examined, and (c) molecular studies
   are under way. Investigation of plant respiratory responses to {[}CO2]
   has reached the third phase: experimental results have been accumulated,
   and mechanistic approaches are being developed to examine alternative
   hypotheses in search for new concepts and/or new quantitative frameworks
   to understand respiratory responses to elevated {[}CO2]. The study of
   nutrient uptake kinetics is still in the second phase: experimental
   evidence has contradicted some of the initial assessments, and more
   experimental studies need to be designed before generalizations can be
   made. It is quite unfortunate that we have not made much progress in
   understanding mechanisms of carbon partitioning during the past two
   decades. This is due in part to the fact that some of the holistic
   theories, such as functional balance and optimality, have not evolved
   into testable hypotheses to guide experimental studies. This paper urges
   modelers to play an increasing role in plant-CO2 research by
   disassembling these existing theories into hypotheses and urges
   experimentalists to design experiments to examine these holistic
   concepts.}},

Abstract = {{Although numerous studies indicate that increasing atmospheric CO2 or
   temperature data are available on the responses of three major
   components of soil respiration {[}i.e. rhizosphere respiration (root and
   root exudates), litter decomposition, and oxidation of soil organic
   matter] to different CO2 and temperature conditions. In this study, we
   applied a dual stable isotope approach to investigate the impact of
   elevated CO2 and elevated temperature on these components of soil CO2
   efflux in Douglas-fir terracosms. We measured both soil CO2 efflux rates
   and the C-13 and O-18 isotopic compositions of soil CO2 efflux in 12
   sun-lit and environmentally controlled terracosms with 4-year-old
   Douglas fir seedlings and reconstructed forest soils under two CO2
   concentrations (ambient and 200 ppmv above ambient) and two air
   temperature regimes (ambient and 4 degrees C above ambient). The stable
   isotope data were used to estimate the relative contributions of
   different components to the overall soil CO2 efflux. In most cases,
   litter decomposition was the dominant component of soil CO2 efflux in
   this system, followed by rhizosphere respiration and soil organic matter
   oxidation. Both elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and elevated
   temperature stimulated rhizosphere respiration and litter decomposition.
   The oxidation of soil organic matter was stimulated only by increasing
   temperature. Release of newly fixed carbon as root respiration was the
   most responsive to elevated CO2, while soil organic matter decomposition
   was most responsive to increasing temperature. Although some assumptions
   associated with this new method need to be further validated,
   application of this dual-isotope approach can provide new insights into
   the responses of soil carbon dynamics in forest ecosystems to future

   evolution}},
Journal = {{ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY AND SYSTEMATICS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{167-199}},
Abstract = {{Until recently, studies of plant reproductive systems have been at the
   population level, using microevolutionary approaches. The development of
   cladistic approaches, combined with the emergence of molecular
   systematics, has resulted in an explosion of phylogenetic studies and an
   increase in interdisciplinary approaches combining ecological and
   systematic methodology. These new approaches offer the possibility of
   testing explicit hypotheses about the number of evolutionary transitions
   in reproductive characters and the evolutionary relationship of these
   characters to changes in the environment. Character mapping may be
   especially useful for detecting convergent evolution. In a number of
   cases, character mapping has provided new insights into the evolution of
   plant breeding systems and pollination biology, especially in suggesting
   the number of times evolutionary transitions have taken place,
   indicating where there have been reversals and suggesting when
   preadaptation has been important. The insights provided by character
   mapping are determined by a number of factors, including the degree of
   confidence in phylogenies underlying these studies and the
   identification of appropriate outgroups. Assumptions about character
   coding, character ordering, inclusion vs. exclusion of characters that
   are mapped on trees in the data matrix, and weighting of characters will
   have profound effects on interpretation of character evolution. Highly
   labile characters that evolve frequently and have the potential to
   undergo reversals may make it difficult to detect the pattern of
   character evolution. Characters that are very strongly correlated with
   each other or with ecological shifts may make prediction of cause and
   effect using phylogenetic approaches difficult because changes in
   characters and ecological shifts will occur, apparently simultaneously,
   on the same branches. Results from microevolutionary studies have been
   used in several cases to weight transitions, suggesting that results of
   phylogenetic studies may not provide fully independent assessments of
   character evolution. While not a simple cure to understanding problems
   that have been studied only in the realm of microevolutionary studies,
   phylogenetic approaches offer clear potential for providing new insights
   for evolutionary studies.}},

Abstract = {{Marine ecosystems are not in steady state, but exhibit continuous
   changes in production and species composition of different trophic
   levels. Sudden changes in biomasses or species composition, a reversal
   of trends, increased seasonal variation and cyclic behaviour all seem to
   contribute to the interannual and decadal variability of the North Sea
   ecosystem. An array of possible causes is introduced and the need for
   more longterm data sets is stressed. From this highly variable ecosystem
   men tries to extract a maximum quantum of fish using more and more
   efficient fishing methods, resulting in an overexploitation of fish
   stocks and notable effects on other species. In this paper an estimate
   is given for the fishing mortality, i.e, the total direct mortality, in
   the populations of non-target invertebrate species generated by the
   trawl fisheries in the Dutch sector of the North Sea in 1994. For the
   species studied the fishing mortality appeared to range from 7 to 48\%.
   Long term observations indicate that stocks of several species declined
   and some species disappeared from the southern North Sea.
   So far, attempts to control overfishing failed. Measures to regulate
   fisheries should be integrated into a general policy for the ecosystem.
   A sustainable North Sea ecosystem has to be a common objective for
   fisheries and nature management, also taking into account the high
   natural variability of the ecosystem. In this paper, several measures
   are proposed: an overall reduction in fishing effort leading to a
   moratorium in case of steep declines in fish stocks, stimulation of new
   designs of more selective and less damaging gears, and designation of
   areas closed for fishing activities to protect species and habitats that
   can not be protected sufficiently otherwise.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this workshop was to outline the state of the art and

   Italy through:
   discussion of ecological network principles
   illustration of international and national programmes
   information on ecological network projects and activities
   raise debate among experts and knowledge among the public
   envisage future perspectives.
   Starting from the concept of ecological networks, the workshop moved to
   the changing trends in nature conservation in Europe and to the two fold
   link with landscape and with land use. Firstly, ecological networks
   should be considered within the wider landscape context, and secondly
   they should be studied in relation to the impact of land use practices.
   Accordingly, a need of sound landscape planning was underlined and a
   holistic approach able to integrate ecological and human issues was
   required. The presentations conformed to the goal of the workshop.
   Gloria Pungetti, University of Reading, UK, illustrated programmes and
   initiatives relevant to ecological networks, both in Europe and in
   Italy. International directives, strategies and conventions have been
   outlined, as well as current studies and projects just started in Italy.
   Rob Jongman, Wageningen Agricultural University, NL, offered a
   contribution on the concept and the structure of ecological networks as
   fundamental for the application of ecological principles. He proposed
   the planning of ecological networks as a method for the compensation of
   the long term fragmentation process in rural landscapes. Paola Mairota,
   Bari Mediterranean Agronomic Institute, IT, showed the function of small
   scale ecological networks in relation to silviculture and agriculture,
   discussing problems on woodland and semi-natural vegetation management
   in southern Europe. Federico Montanari and Paolo Cagnoli, ARPA
   Emilia-Romagna, IT, indicated those regional activities of nature
   conservation which will be essential for the development of a future
   ecological network, and the related role of the Regional Agencies for
   Environmental Protection (ARPAs). The workshop concluded that progresses
   in ecological networks should be referred to the pan-European framework,
   which is facing re-establishment, land use change and new economic
   development. In this context, conserving nature and cultural landscapes,
   and consequently integrating ecological networks in the planning
   process, must be among the policy objectives of the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive regulation of the Middle Rio Grande's natural flow regime,
   together with the effects of introduced tree species, landscape
   fragmentation, and increasing wildfires, are obstacles for any level of
   restoration of its native riparian forest (bosque). However, carefully
   monitored partial restoration is possible and greatly needed to prevent
   the bosque's serious decline. Monitoring can reveal temporal and spatial
   changes in the bosque's ecological dynamics. The Bosque Ecosystem
   Monitoring Program, which currently uses volunteers to synchronously
   record changes in biological populations and ecological processes at
   four sites in the middle valley, shows how this can he done. Partial
   restoration depends on well timed releases following heavy spring
   runoff. When these exceed bankfull stage, overbank flooding will (1)
   establish new cottonwood-willow stands at suitable locations and (2)
   enhance ecological maintenance of mature stands. Partial restoration can
   potentially involve alternative, non mutually exclusive manipulations of
   the river's hydrology within a given reach. A different approach,
   currently exemplified by the Albuquerque Overbank Project, involves
   lowering a bank so that natural flooding can establish new native
   vegetation. These conceptual and empirical efforts can build a
   foundation for bosque managers to assess where modified native bosque
   can persist, and can be the beginning of a comprehensive program to
   manage the riparian forest on a sustainable basis.}},

   In this case, reducing its regularly increasing number requires the

Abstract = {{We review patterns of reservoir colonization and aging in neotropical
   reservoirs, with emphasis on the Upper Parana River Basin, Brazil. The
   filling stage was a period of rapid and intense transformation, an
   abrupt transition from a lotic to a lentic environment. This stage
   lasted 8-80 d, which was relatively short in comparison with reservoirs
   in temperate zones or other reservoirs in the Amazon basin. Release of
   nutrients, increases in water transparency, decreases in turbulence, and
   development of thermal and oxygen stratification were key factors
   characterizing this transition. Anoxic events were critical during this
   stage. During the first few days individuals of various fish species
   occupied the entire reservoir and water column, independent of the
   habitat they had inhabited in the river, or the type they would
   eventually inhabit in the new lake. As anoxia progressed, fish moved to
   the embayments and tributaries including the main river. Species that
   remained in the reservoir concentrated mainly in shallow, littoral areas
   and near the mouth of tributaries. The season of the filling stage was
   extremely relevant to the colonization process. The ecological
   transformations observed during the filling stage of neotropical
   reservoirs are likely more accentuated than in temperate reservoirs,
   because water temperature remains warm around the year.
   After the original upsurge, no severe changes in abiotic environment
   were identified, but a gradual colonization by submersed aquatic
   macrophytes was evident in some reservoirs, and changes in the fish
   communities were identified in all reservoirs. In one reservoir,
   diversity of macrophyte communities became higher than in natural
   environments within its basin. There was a general absence of fish
   species pre-adapted to colonize the pelagic zones, and species diversity
   was higher in the littoral zone. Many species that colonized neotropical
   reservoirs reproduced in lateral tributaries or upstream stretches. In
   at least one reservoir, reproductive effort by the fish assemblage in
   the first two years was low and increased thereafter. Migrators and
   large-bodied fish reached peak abundance shortly after impoundment, but
   assemblages shifted towards a dominance by sedentary, medium-sized
   species. As stability was approached after the upsurge period, diets
   shifted towards more stable, autochthonous resources. In general,
   detritivores-illiophages showed sharp reductions, whereas herbivores and
   zooplanktivores increased-. Piscivores increased in some reservoirs but
   decreased in others; often they became abundant where pre-adapted
   latustrine species existed within the basin.
   Anticipated environmental changes such as reservoir age, including
   nutrient accumulation, siltation, and habitat deterioration,
   particularly in the littoral zone are expected to cause faster changes
   in the fish assemblages. The most notable ones include a reduction in
   the number of top predators, mean size of species, and species richness.
   Pelagic species are expected to become dominant as benthic organisms
   decline and littoral habitat deteriorate. Short-lived species with fast
   growth or reproductive compensation are expected to have survival
   advantages. in advanced stages of aging, fish communities are
   anticipated to consist of species typical of murky, shallow water, with
   low oxygen. These aging effects are long-term, but will become
   noticeable in littoral areas sooner.}},

   for feral pig control}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{251-261}},
Abstract = {{Because it achieves rapid reductions in pig density, helicopter shooting
   is perceived to be a cost-effective option for feral pig control. In
   order to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the technique and develop
   predictive models of variation in costs, functional response models
   derived from predator-prey theory were fitted to 3 data-sets describing
   variation in kill rates with feral pig density. The data-sets were
   collected during shooting programs conducted on the Mary River
   floodplain in northern Australia, and on the Macquarie Marshes and Paroo
   River floodplain in western New South Wales. Fitted models indicated
   that variation in kill rates with pig density took the form of a Type 3
   functional response for all 3 data sets, kill rates approaching a
   constant maximum at high pig densities and declining toward 0 at pig
   densities greater than 0. While maximum kill rates were similar for the
   3 shooting programs (average 60.49 kill h(-1), range 49.64-76.28),
   densities below which no pigs would theoretically be killed varied
   significantly (average 2.79 pigs km(-2), range 1.34-5.02). Similar
   maximum kill rates for the 3 shooting programs indicates that, once
   located, the time taken by shooting teams to dispatch pigs was
   relatively constant (0.023 h). Variation in threshold densities below
   which no more pigs would theoretically be shot, indicates that as the
   density of pigs was reduced, their vulnerability to shooting teams
   differed between the 3 shooting programs. This may have reflected
   differences between sites in either the capacity of resident pigs to
   learn to evade shooting teams or, more likely, the availability of
   refuge habitat. For 2 of the shooting programs, too few data were
   available to estimate the effect of declining pig density on kill rate,
   precluding detailed examination of differences in the efficiency with
   which pigs were found (search efficiency). Using estimates of pig
   density below which no pigs would theoretically be shot to set a limit
   to the effectiveness of shooting programs, models predicting variation
   in hours per kill with pig density were derived from each data set.
   These models demonstrated that hours per kill increased exponentially as
   shooting reduced pig populations below threshold densities of
   approximately 2-6 pigs km(-2). Generalised models relating variation in
   cost per kill to pig density for the 3 shooting programs are described.}},

   The expansion was achieved by establishment of new ramets, increase in
   the number of shoots per rooting point playing a minor role. Individual

   (TM) satellite data can yield forest classifications with spatially
   detailed information down to the dominant canopy species level in
   temperate deciduous and mixed forests. We stratified a large region
   (10(6) ha) by ecoregions (10(3)-10(4) ha). Within each ecoregion,
   plot-level, field inventory data were aggregated to provide information
   on secondary and subcanopy tree species occurrence, and tree age class
   distributions. We derived a probabilistic algorithm to assign
   information from a point coverage (forest inventory sampling points) and
   a polygon coverage (ecoregion boundaries) to a raster map (satellite
   land cover classification). The method was applied to a region in
   northern Wisconsin, USA. The satellite map captures the occurrence and
   the patch structure of canopy dominants. The inventory data provide
   important secondary information on age class and associated species not

   maps of tree species distribution and stand age reflecting differences

   examine forest landscape change over time. As an example, we discuss the

Abstract = {{Coral reefs are highly complex systems characterized by mostly nonlinear

   successfully in modeling highly nonlinear systems in engineering,

   zone management model, we constructed a coral reef model that predicts
   changes in coral cover and diversity under anthropogenic stress, namely
   nutrient enrichment and increased sedimentation. The model reflects our
   current knowledge of the fringing reefs of Curacao, Netherlands
   Antilles. The seven input variables used were dissolved inorganic
   nitrogen and phosphate, suspended particulate matter, maximum colony
   size, substratum available for colonization, coral cover, and coral
   diversity. Each variable was divided into three triangular fuzzy sets
   reflecting low, medium, and high values. For each of the 2187 possible
   input combinations we estimated cover and diversity after 10 years. We
   consulted experts with a thorough knowledge of the local reef system and
   have automatically accounted for interactions between the variables
   described above. The model clearly shows how increases in nutrient and

Abstract = {{Despite growing manifestations of global warming and the commitment of
   most nations to move towards reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a
   simple device that can be effective in reducing GHG emissions continues
   to be overlooked or even rejected. This is to acknowledge the fact that
   carbon emissions inflict global costs that are not borne by emitters.
   This paper advocates that all activities emitting or saving cat-ban
   emissions should internalize the carbon cost inflicted or avoided by new
   projects involving CO2. Considering the current wide range of carbon
   cost estimates, the paper recommends that a two-stage approach be
   adopted. Firstly, incorporate carbon costs in project analysis only
   theoretically in order to differentiate objectively among alternative
   designs involving carbon emissions of varying degrees. Different
   estimates of the costs of a ton of carbon would be used in order to test
   the sensitivity of rates of return to alternative carbon castings. While
   this process would have the effect of screening the allocation of scarce
   investment funds among projects that affect global warming in different
   degrees, it should be viewed as only a first step. Secondly, we advocate
   a rigorous process of passing through estimated carbon costs to the
   ultimate users of the services of carbon-emitting projects and
   processes. It is this ultimate process that will secure the urgently
   needed transition from the current dependence on fossil fuels to more
   benign sources of energy that would reduce climate-change risks. Since
   the time available is limited, the paper points out the urgency of these
   proposals that are crucial for sustainability. (C) 1998 Published by

Abstract = {{Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) was an abundant tree species in eastern North

   canopy is likely to have had an impact on forest composition, structure,
   and function. The response of forest vegetation to the mid-Holocene
   hemlock decline at two sites in southern Ontario, Canada was examined
   using paleoecological methods. At one site, where T. canadensis declined
   sharply, several other forest taxa increased in abundance, resulting in
   a long-term shift in forest composition. At a second site, pollen
   percentages of T. canadensis did not decrease so dramatically, and less
   change in forest composition occurred. At both sites, T. canadensis took
   similar to 2000 yr to recover from the decline and reach former

Abstract = {{Increased opportunities for information are one potential benefit of
   sociality. We apply this idea to the advantages of colonial breeding in
   bird species that are typically monogamous within a breeding season but
   often form new pair-bonds in subsequent seasons. Individuals may benefit
   from nesting in colonies at high density by identifying good-quality
   potential alternative mates among their neighbours. The opportunities
   for finding a better mating option are likely to increase with colony
   size and density. We tested this prediction with a comparative analysis
   of the association between mate fidelity and coloniality in waterbirds
   (wading birds and seabirds), where there is wide variation in both the
   degree of mate retention over consecutive breeding seasons and the
   degree of coloniality. We used two comparative statistical analyses, one
   based upon generalized least squares and the other based upon a
   continuous-time Markov model, to test whether the pattern of association
   between divorce rate and degree of coloniality was evidence for
   correlated evolutionary change in the two characters. We found a
   significant and positive association between divorce rate and the degree
   of coloniality in waterbirds, The probable ancestral state corresponds
   to a combination of a high degree of coloniality with no, or weak, mate
   fidelity. The reconstruction of the historical pattern of character
   origin and evolution indicates that the transition from a high to a low

Abstract = {{The accumulation of non-structural leaf carbohydrates is one of the most
   consistent plant responses to elevated CO2. It has been found in both
   fast-and slow-growing plants and is largely independent of the duration
   of exposure. Changes in leaf quality are thus to be expected,
   irrespective of other plant responses to atmospheric CO2 enrichment.
   However, there is no experimental evidence from tropical forests, the
   biome with the largest biomass carbon pool. Here we report in situ
   mesophyll responses of mature tropical trees to a doubling of CO2,
   Individually CO2-enriched leaves on 25 to 35-m-tall forest trees living
   at 26-35 degrees C can be assumed to experience little sink limitation,
   and so, may be expected to exhibit no or very little carbohydrate
   accumulation. We tested this hypothesis using the leaf cup method on
   leaves accessible via the canopy crane of the Smithsonian Tropical
   Research Institute in a semi-deciduous tropical forest in Panama. We
   also investigated the influence of the leaf-specific light regime,
   another possible environmental determinant of leaf carbon gain and
   mobile leaf carbohydrates. Total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC)
   reached a new steady state concentration after less than 4 days of
   exposure to twice ambient CO2 concentration. Against expectation, all
   four tree species investigated (Anacardium excelsum, Cecropia longipes,
   C. peltata, Ficus insipida) accumulated significant amounts of TNC (+41
   to +61\%) under elevated CO2. The effect was stronger at the end of the
   daylight period (except for Ficus), but was still significant in all
   four species at the end of the dark period. In contrast, neither
   artificial nor natural shading affected leaf TNC. Taken together, these
   observations suggest that TNC accumulation reflects a mesophyll-bound
   tissue response specific to elevated CO2, presumably unrelated to sink
   limitations. Thus, leaves of tropical forests seem not to be an
   exception, and will most likely contain more non-structural
   carbohydrates in a CO2-rich world.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape is a dynamic phenomenon that almost continuously changes. The
   overall change of a landscape is the result of complex and interacting
   natural and spontaneous processes and planned actions by man. However,
   numerous activities by a large number of individuals are not concerted
   and contribute to the autonomous evolution of the landscape in a similar
   way as natural processes do. Consequently, landscape changes in a
   somewhat chaotic way and man tries to control this evolution regularly
   by planned actions, which however, are seldom realised as they were
   intended. Landscapes are formed by many components which all have their
   own dynamics of change. Therefore, studying change must consider the
   nature of the component or feature looked to, as well as its specific
   frequency, pace and magnitude of change. To detect changes, the method
   to describe or measure the landscape features is important as well as
   the availability of adequate and comparable information in map-like
   format for different time periods. However, studying the change of
   landscape components separately seldom gives a good idea about the
   overall change of the landscape. The landscape as a whole looks more
   stable and much small change do not necessarily change its holistic
   appearance, its type or identity. Landscape holism is closely related to
   structural aspects, which reflect order and chaos. The main force behind
   change is the reorganisation of the existing structures to optimise
   their functioning. Existing landscape structures form the framework and
   constraint of all processes and activities in this geographical space.
   New needs for functioning will demand new adapted structures and will
   induce change. Structural order and disorder is also linked with entropy
   and information theory offers possibilities to describe the holistic
   aspects of a landscape and to measure and monitor the overall change of
   a landscape. A method is proposed to determine the distribution of the
   entropy in the landscape based upon transect sampling of landscape
   features on old and recent topographical maps, aerial photographs and by
   field survey in order to create time series. The results show that
   different landscape types are characterised by different entropy
   distributions and that changes in time can be monitored indicating
   different complex processes of overall landscape change. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Spatial heterogeneity presents a fundamental challenge to conventional
   ecological theory. Although ecological systems are usually
   heterogeneous, it is not clear how often heterogeneity fundamentally
   alters their behavior. We addressed this issue with a study of the
   infection of ticks (Ixodes scapularis) by the causative agent of Lyme
   disease (the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi) in multiple habitats
   within a semirural landscape, combining both field and modeling
   approaches. We sampled the densities and infection prevalences of ticks
   in five habitats over two years in southeastern New York. There were
   consistent differences among habitats in adult infection prevalence,
   which was unrelated to tick density, suggesting that local habitat
   features exert some control over local risk of exposure to infected
   ticks. Other results underscored the importance of processes taking
   place on larger scales. We observed a positive relationship between the
   change in tick density within a cohort from the nymphal to adult stages,
   and changes in prevalence over the same period. Habitats with many
   adults relative to the number of nymphs several months earlier showed
   increasing prevalence of B. burgdorferi. Presumably these habitats were
   receiving immigrating ticks that became infected on their dispersing
   hosts.
   We designed a computer model, patterned after the life cycle of I.
   scapularis, to determine whether patterns observed in the field could be
   explained by dispersal among habitats differing in host species
   composition. The model showed that habitat-related variation in tick
   density and spirochete prevalence was maintained even with moderate
   dispersal, as long as the different habitats supported distinct
   assemblages of hosts. Dispersal produced nonlinear or threshold
   responses under many conditions, due to positive and negative feedbacks.
   Such feedback is a general feature of many ecological systems, which
   implies that the behavior of heterogeneous systems will very often be
   unpredictable from an understanding of isolated components.}},

Abstract = {{Opposed to traditional mathematical methods, the technique of
   individual-oriented modelling chooses distinguishable individuals as the
   basic entities of description. An ecosystem is described by all static
   and dynamic properties of the individuals involved in the system as well
   as time varying properties of the environment. Individuals change their
   state over lime or due to internal and external events. Using the
   individual-oriented approach, programming skills are indispensable.
   Coding individual-oriented models is a complex, tedious and error prone
   task, which leads to a long list of problems. Many, although not all,
   problems may be solved using object-oriented software libraries. ECOSIM
   is a C++-class library especially designed to support
   individual-oriented modelling and simulation of ecological systems.
   ECOSIM brings together new advances in object-oriented discrete-event
   simulation and ecology. The process of implementing individual-oriented
   models is facilitated by providing classes for those parts, that are
   common to all such models. This covers among others the specification of
   static and dynamic properties of `individuals', the specification of

Abstract = {{Fluctuating asymmetry is a measure of developmental instability and
   results from both genomic and environmental influences. Levels of
   asymmetry are (in part) influenced by mechanical constraints, as
   asymmetry is believed to reduce efficiency. Here we have investigated
   the influence of habitat structure ({''}open{''} and ``cluttered{''}
   environments) on primary flight feather asymmetry and flight performance
   in European starlings. Our findings indicate that the increased flight
   demands of cluttered habitats act to reduce primary asymmetry and
   increase flight performance. These data are discussed in terms of the
   influence of asymmetry on flight performance and the mechanisms that
   give rise to asymmetry. This study also presents a novel method, i.e.,
   examining within-individual changes in asymmetry, by which the
   detrimental and positive influence of the environment could be studied
   in subsequent field and laboratory studies without confounding
   environmental effects with genomic influences.}},

   applying the concept of adaptive management to complex management

Abstract = {{The new watershed model SWIM was developed in order to provide a
   comprehensive GIS-based tool for hydrological and water quality
   modelling in mesoscale watersheds (from 100 to 10000 km(2)), which can
   be parametrized using regionally available information. SWIM is based on
   two previously developed tools-SWAT and MATSALU. The model integrates
   hydrology, vegetation, erosion and nitrogen dynamics at the watershed
   scale. SWIM has three-level disaggregation scheme and is coupled to the
   Geographic Information System GRASS. A robust approach is suggested for
   the nitrogen modelling in mesoscale watersheds. Model test and
   validation were performed sequentially for hydrology, crop growth,
   nitrogen and erosion in a number of mesoscale watersheds in the German
   part of the Elbe drainage basin. Firstly, the hydrological module was
   tested in five watersheds of different size with different topography,
   soil and spatial resolution of input data. After that the test was
   performed for the crop module in the state of Brandenburg, for the
   nitrogen module in the rural basin of Stepenitz, and for the erosion
   module in the mountainous Mulde basin. A comprehensive scheme of spatial
   disaggregation into subbasins and hydrotopes combined with reasonable
   restriction on the subbasin size allows the assessment of water
   resources and water quality to be performed with modest data
   requirements at the regional scale. The direct connection to land use

Abstract = {{Georges Bank, a shallow submarine plateau located off the New England
   coast, has supported valuable commercial fisheries for several
   centuries. The region is characterized by high levels of primary
   productivity and, historically, high levels of fish production, Within
   the last four decades Georges Bank has been subjected to major
   perturbations that have profoundly altered levels of catch, abundance,
   and species composition. The arrival of distant water Beets during the
   early 1960s resulted in dramatic increases in effective fishing effort
   and the subsequent commercial collapse of several fish populations.
   Total fish biomass is estimated to have declined by >50\% on Georges
   Bank during the period of operation of the distant water Beets, The
   implementation of extended jurisdiction (the 200-mile {[}370.4-km]
   limit) in 1977 was followed by modernization and increased capacity of
   the domestic Beet, resulting in a second perturbation to the system that
   resulted in further declines in groundfish populations to historically
   low levels, A subsequent increase in the abundance of species of low
   commercial value was documented, with an apparent replacement of gadid
   and Bounder species by small elasmobranchs (including dogfish sharks and
   skates), Examination of feeding guild structure suggests that this
   switch in species dominance may have been Linked to a competitive
   release, The small elasmobranchs, notably dogfish sharks, also prey on
   species of commercial importance (primarily small pelagics, including
   herring and mackerel), The cumulative impacts on the groundfish
   populations as a result of intense exploitation and predation pressure
   may have been further exacerbated by effects of fishing gear on the
   physical structure of the habitat. Implications for the development of
   an ecosystem-based management approach are described.}},

Abstract = {{1. Widespread declines in the populations of many British farmland birds
   have occurred since the early 1970s, We must understand the causes of
   these declines to make recommendations about conservation and
   agricultural management, and this can be approached by investigating the
   relationships, across species, between abundance and agricultural
   change. We describe novel, quantitative approaches to the interpretation
   of abundance indices from which reliable inferences about conservation
   status can be made.
   2. We calculated farmland Common Birds Census indices for 42 species,
   smoothed the series to reveal underlying trends and estimated confidence
   intervals for the changes in abundance.
   3. Between 1968 and 1995, the abundance of 12 species declined
   significantly and that of 14 species increased.
   4. Specialization was the only significant determinant of changes in
   abundance (of 10 tests against species characteristics): 13 farmland
   specialists declined, on average, by 30\%, whilst 29 more generalist
   species underwent an average increase of 23\%, confirming that farmland
   birds should engender conservation concern.
   5. Smoothed abundance curves, transformed to emphasize trend direction
   and timing, were then compared quantitatively to identify whether groups
   of species had shared common trends.
   6. Species tended not to be strongly grouped, but small groups of
   species with common trends were identified. Similarities in ecology
   among grouped species clarify the possible environmental causes of their
   population trends, indicating future research priorities.
   7. The groups identified included: one group consisting of three thrush
   species Turdus and the skylark Alauda arvensis L. which all declined
   from the mid-1970s after being stable previously; one group comprising
   three trans-Saharan migrant warblers (Sylvidae), whose abundance fell in
   the early 1970s and later increased, and a diverse group of six smoothly
   increasing species.
   8. Turning points were identified as where each species' population
   trend turned significantly, revealing critical periods during which
   populations are likely to have been affected by environmental change.
   9. Three collections of downward turning points were found, including
   one in the mid-1970s when many farmland bird declines began. Four other
   periods each included many upturns. The groups of turning points should
   facilitate the identification of environmental changes which have had
   widespread effects. Management prescriptions can then be designed to
   reverse or to mirror such key changes and thereby focus conservation
   effort effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Records of population changes of caribou come from various sources
   (historical accounts, hunting and trading statistics, herd surveys) that
   are typically incomplete and discontinuous in Lime and space. Here Ne
   propose a new method for the evaluation of past caribou activity using
   tree-ring records from boreal and subarctic conifer stands. The
   age-frequency distributions of trampling scars produced by caribou
   hooves on surficial roots and low branches of erect and stunted conifers
   are used as an index of the passage of caribou through stands during the
   snow-free period. To verify if changes in the age structure of trampling
   scars correspond to changes in abundance of caribou movement, we
   analyzed factors influencing production and loss of scars at tyro
   lichen-woodland sites in northeastern Quebec-Labrador (Canada). The
   detailed analysis of trampling scars in the first site indicates that
   the capacity of conifers to produce scars is maintained under a regime
   of repeated caribou traffic scars were formed at new positions along the
   exposed roots and scars continued to be produced at a same position in a
   minimum time of one growing season, even after 15 years of caribou
   traffic. The influence of repeated caribou trampling on loss of scars
   was measured by comparing the age structure of scars of three vegetation
   groups (based on caribou trail network) with different intensities of
   use. The similarity of the age structures of the three groups showed
   that scar loss due to trampling was hardly detectable, which indicated
   that scar loss was low in comparison to the number of scars produced,
   even in the most used trails. Sampling of trampling scars during two
   successive years at the second site showed that the stability of the age
   structure of scars was nor affected by moderate caribou traffic. Our
   results, therefore, indicate that most of the information deduced from
   the age structures of trampling scars comes from changes in caribou
   activity. The method opens the possibility of assessing caribou activity
   in time (several decades) and space over large areas of the boreal
   forest and the forest-tundra biomes.}},

Abstract = {{Historical and ecological data from north-central Massachusetts suggest
   that widespread and intensive human disturbance after European
   settlement led to a shift in forest composition and obscured regional
   patterns of species abundance. A paleoecological approach was required
   to place recent forest dynamics in a long-term context. Pollen and
   charcoal data from 11 small lakes in north-central Massachusetts were
   used to reconstruct local vegetation dynamics and fire histories across
   the region over the past 1000 years. The sites are located across an
   environmental gradient. Paleoecological data indicate that prior to
   European settlement, there was regional variation in forest composition
   corresponding to differences in climate, substrate, and fire regime.
   Oak, chestnut, and hickory were abundant at low elevations, whereas
   hemlock, beech, sugar maple, and yellow birch were common at high
   elevations. Fire appears to have been more frequent and/or intense at
   lower elevations, maintaining high abundances of oak, and archaeological
   data suggest Native American populations were greater in these areas. A
   change in forest composition at higher elevations, around 550 years
   before present, may be related to the Little Ice Age (a period of
   variable climate), fire, and/or activity by Native Americans, and led to
   regional convergence in forest composition. After European settlement,
   forest composition changed markedly in response to human disturbance and
   there was a sharp increase in rates of vegetation change. Regional
   patterns were obscured further, leading to homogenization of broad-scale
   forest composition. There is no indication from the pollen data that
   forests are returning to pre-European settlement forest composition, and
   rates of vegetation change remain high, reflecting continuing
   disturbance on the landscape, despite regional reforestation.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Decision Support Systems (DSS) and
   Integrated Scenario Modelling Frameworks provide a set of valuable tools
   for resource managers and policy makers, allowing them to make more
   informed decisions.
   In the past a non-integrated approach has been adopted in applying
   techniques such as statistical and mathematical analysis, modelling
   systems, GIS, DSS and visualisation for decision making. However, there
   is a need to integrate these techniques to convey complex model and
   analysis information as well as complex spatial and temporal
   information. Integrated scenario modelling toolkits allow the
   integration of techniques, using both qualitative and quantitative
   methods. These tools are becoming increasingly valuable for exploring
   the behaviour of large ecological, environmental and management systems
   around the world.
   A modelling framework is being developed for identifying the likely
   impact of policy and program options at regional and Basin levels on the
   biophysical resource base, agricultural productivity and socio-economic
   structure of irrigated regions of the Southern Murray-Darling Basin in
   Australia, over the next 20 years. The framework links four main
   components: biophysical, production, enterprise and regional/national
   flow-on effects. Testing the framework across a range of price, cost and
   yield scenarios, enables comparisons of the impacts and sensitivities of
   changes on business return and level of equity on the farm and the
   flow-on effects to the community.
   The exploration of alternative futures can be achieved by comparing
   decision scenarios generated by the framework. Decision scenarios allow
   the policymaker to anticipate and understand risk and to discover new
   options for action. Well documented scenarios support informed debate of
   the policy decisions built into the scenarios and the resolution of
   their tensions. The relative merits of alternative futures and policies
   can be discussed as can the relative merits of reaching the same end
   point by different means.
   This paper discusses the concepts which facilitate an appropriate
   framework for achieving the integration of these technologies under a
   modular computing structure.}},

   fishermen of fish habitat, changes to habitat observed over time, and
   fishing gear effects. In addition, the report evaluates the
   effectiveness of different approaches to identify fishermen's knowledge
   and document their observations. To better represent fishermen and
   provide accurate information, we were interested in fishermen's
   responses to two questions: (I) How can we better solicit fishermen's
   knowledge of habitat, and (2) what would make it possible for fishermen
   to share that information? The results of this study were influenced by
   several factors, including the fact that methodologies for integrating
   fishermen's knowledge into fisheries scientific literature and fisheries
   management are at an embryonic stage. In addition, for this initial
   study, resources were limited, which gave the survey a strong New
   England bias. We also found that fishermen are reluctant to get involved
   in essential fish habitat identification for several reasons, including
   the perceived proprietary nature of their habitat information. This
   review represents an important first step toward making the crucial
   linkage between fisheries management and fishermen's local knowledge.
   This study and future similar studies will provide opportunities to
   bring fishermen's knowledge to the forefront as essential fish habitat
   management plans are being developed. The contribution of fishermen's
   knowledge should help managers design a balanced regulatory system that
   will lead to sustainable fisheries and fisheries communities.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in silviculture and other forms of cultivation in our
   landscapes, recently have led to more flexibility in hunting methods, as
   well. Nature-oriented silviculture, providing more cover for game
   species, shows that our conventional methods of hunting game ungulates
   in Central Europe - as, e.g., single shooting from a concealed stand
   etc. - no longer leads to sufficient populations according to
   silvicultural needs. Increasing the hunting pressure contributes to
   increased shyness of game ungulates and, thus, leads to increased damage
   by vertebrates in forest stands. In some of our (German) National parks
   and in larger state forest districts, we tested several traditional
   forms of ``motion hunting{''} and we compared the results with those
   derived from new-developed and modified forms, respectively When
   comparing different forms of such motion hunting methods, special notice
   was given as to which game species can be hunted most efficiently at
   what time of the year, focusing on the question of how to minimize
   hunting pressure. Some of the results are reported dealing with roe and
   red deer, Capreolus capreolus, and Cervus elaphus and wild boar, Sus
   scrofa, and including the deployment of specialized dogs. Possibilities
   of including better estimates of game species population density through
   so-called ``count huntings{''} are discussed, too. indicators allowing
   evaluation of such hunting methods are given and discussed.}},

   savannas were also included using a simple model based on precipitation.
   The total C pool in above-and below-ground forests and grass/shrub

Abstract = {{1. Key factor analysis is widely used as the first step in analysing
   census data to identify factors responsible for population change, but
   is generally considered to be flawed. The conceptual problems can be
   overcome by assessing the effects of variation in the life-history
   parameters on population growth rate, lambda. We refer to this as
   lambda-contribution analysis. The difference from key factor analysis is
   that now each life history parameter is weighted by the sensitivity of
   lambda to that parameter. The rationale for this modification is that
   population growth rate is the best available measure of population
   change.
   2. The advantages of the new method are: that it correctly assesses the
   effects of life history parameters on population growth rate; that birth
   rates are included in the analysis in a natural way without making
   arbitrary assumptions about birth rate mortalities; that
   post-reproductive individuals who do not contribute to population growth
   rate are zero-weighted; and that the analysis can be applied to
   populations with overlapping generations.
   3. It is proposed that lambda-contribution analysis should replace
   conventional key-factor analysis as the first step in a wider analysis
   of population change and density dependence. lambda-contribution
   analysis also links census studies of natural populations with the use
   of life-table response experiments.}},

   concluded that the mechanism of isotope fractionation changed rapidly

   The cover of several species of sponge, including Cymbastela

   `Beyond BACI' experimental design was used to determine the

Abstract = {{An objective method of determining national conservation priorities is
   vital to use scarce resources effectively, but no method is yet widely
   accepted. The `Conservation Cube' method of Avery et al. (1995: Ibis
   137, 232-239), which includes three biological axes (National Status;
   International Importance, and European/global status), is tested for a
   highly threatened group of animals, British butterflies. The results are
   compared with Red Lists constructed using old and new IUCN criteria. A
   new feature of both procedures is the evaluation of threat due to rate
   of decline, and new thresholds are suggested to assess the decline of
   butterflies from published IO-km grid square distribution maps. The
   analysis shows that almost half (49\%) of the 59 resident British
   butterflies are extinct or threatened: 8\% are extinct; 12\% are a high
   priority largely owing to their rapid rate of decline; whereas 29\% are
   a medium priority owing to their moderate rates of decline. Most high
   priority species qualify as Vulnerable under the new IUCN criteria using
   UK guidelines, but many medium priority species fail to qualify. We
   suggest that all globally threatened species are classified at least as
   Vulnerable at national level and that two new Lower Risk categories are
   created: Internationally Significant and Moderate Decline. The two
   procedures would then form a comparable, rational procedure for
   identifying conservation priorities that is applicable to all animal
   groups for which distributional data are available. (C) 1997 Published

Abstract = {{The natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) is an endangered species in Britain
   and has been legally protected since 1975. This amphibian suffered a
   major decline during the first half of the twentieth century, due partly
   to habitat destruction but mostly to successional changes in its
   specialized biotopes and anthropogenic acidification of breeding sites.
   In addition to site and species protection, extensive autecological
   research over the past 25 years has provided the foundations for an
   intensive, 3-year species recovery program funded by the statutory
   nature conservation organizations (English Nature and the countryside
   Council for Wales). This program was based on habitat management and
   reintroductions to restored sites and followed similar but less
   intensive efforts. Management of heath and dune habitats focused on
   restoration and maintenance of early stages of seral succession,
   initially through physical clearance of invasive scrub and woodland
   vegetation and later by the reestablishment of grazing regimes similar
   to those prevalent in earlier centuries. In some cases extra breeding
   pools wee provided to either increase or stabilize natterjack toad
   populations that had become reliant on one or very few pools at small
   sites or to promote range expansion within large habitat areas. By 1995
   proactive conservation work had been carried out at 29 (69\%) of the 39
   sites with extant native populations, including 8 during the recovery
   program. Twenty reintroductions also had been attempted, including nine
   during the program. At least six reintroductions resulted in the
   foundation of expanding new populations, and an additional eight have
   shown initial signs of success. Conservation methods developed for Bufo
   calamita should provide a useful precedent for long-term conservation of
   early successional habitats and species.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is a report on the past, status-quo and perspectives of
   vegetation classification, still a major occupation of many vegetation
   scientists. The history of vegetation classification is discussed
   against a background of several controversial issues such as the problem
   of continuum vs. discontinuum, naturalness vs. arbitrariness of the
   nature of plant communities, universality vs. ad hoc character of
   syntaxonomic schemes, as well as classical versus numerical approaches
   to data analysis for classification purposes.
   The development of the methodology of vegetation science and the present
   image of vegetation classification is documented by a bibliometric
   analysis of the publication record of four major journals: Journal of
   vegetation Science; Vegetatio, Phytocoenologia and Tuexenia. This
   analysis revealed a persisting controversy between traditional and
   numerical approaches to vegetation classification. A series of important
   changes in vegetation science (foundation of new journals, change of
   editorial policy by the established, important meetings) punctuate a
   period called the `Innovation period'.
   Several trends in the development of methods of vegetation systematics
   are summarized under the headings formalism, pluralism, functionalism,
   pragmatism and imdeterminism. Some new features, such as the development
   and improvement of numerical tools, use of large data banks and attempts
   to summarize the theory of vegetation classification are discussed. The
   new growth-form system of Barkman initiated a revival of
   physiognomy-based vegetation classification. Within this framework the
   use of the character-type concept and the development of new numerical
   methods for studying the hierarchical structure of character-set types
   seems to be a promising approach. The achievements of population biology
   and ecophysiology have affected vegetation science by emphasizing the
   functionality of species within plant communities. The use of guilds and
   other functional groups has experienced an increasing interest from
   vegetation scientists. Applied in vegetation science, fuzzy-set theory
   has bridged the techniques of classification and ordination of plant
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Today, in parts of the United States, rapidly expanding decentralized
   growth is spreading a homogenous form across the landscape and
   destroying multiple layers of cultural history in its wake. In many
   places new development completely replaces the old and erases the
   opportunity for the community to retain an integrity and richness that
   only places containing a layering of old and new can have, Lost are the
   opportunities for the community to preserve the character and texture of
   the past, maintain a cultural heritage, and retain those particular
   features that can distinguish one community from another. History can be
   of use to rapidly growing communities in at least two ways: It can
   provide lessons that will help communities deal with the difficult
   problems of today, and the landscape itself-full of the historical
   artifacts of the past of the community should be considered in the
   design of communities. This paper will develop lessons from those two
   uses of history that will be helpful for designers and planners working
   in the landscape today. Those lessons will be specifically applied in
   one of the emerging edge cities on the outer fringe of the sphere of
   urban growth surrounding New York-the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania. The
   era of rapid change today is not the first. During the late nineteenth
   century another type of homogenous development quickly altered great
   portions of the existing landscape. Landscape architects and urban
   planners like Horace Cleveland argued that new communities should have a
   heritage and should be carefully grounded in the landscape that existed
   prior to development. From that approach we can derive three basic
   lessons still applicable in the era of rapid change today: The need for
   greater landscape understanding, the importance of leaving a heritage
   for future generations, and the value of education and interpretation.
   If the lessons of Cleveland were applied in the Lehigh Valley, this
   nationally significant historic cultural landscape might be embraced as
   the fabric upon which to build the emerging community. The many eras and
   themes of the tangible past of the region would first need to be
   carefully studied and assessed-that landscape understanding forming a
   base from which to make planning decisions. As development continues
   remains of the past might be intentionally incorporated into the new
   community providing residents with greater richness and the experience
   of both past and present in their daily lives. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

   Bluegrass-Aspendale, constructed in 1937, was one of the first 49 public

   reductions, progressive economic stagnation, racial segregation and

   reinforced through the realignment of roadways into cul-de-sacs and unit
   facade renovation. The necessity of developing a comprehensive system of
   supportive social services for residents, particularly police
   protection, is also emphasized. While the design of new public housing
   concentrates on small scale scatter-ed sites and homeownership,
   Bluegrass-Aspendale serves as an example of how an older inner city

Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{The current theory that sexual selection results from female preference
   for males with good genes suffers from several problems. An alternative
   explanation, the pathogen transmission avoidance hypothesis, argues that
   the primary function of showy traits is to provide a reliable signal of
   current disease status, so that sick individuals can be avoided during
   mating. This study shows that a significant risk of pathogen
   transmission occurs during mating and that showy traits are reliable
   indicators of current disease status. A simulation model of population
   dynamics linked with pathogen transmission indicates that female
   choosiness traits are selectively advantageous and spread through the
   population but because the selective benefit of choosiness depends on
   the percentage of choosy females and bright males, as sexual selection
   proceeds the selection pressure is reduced and the process becomes
   self-limiting rather than runaway. Thus, an epidemic model approach
   leads to very different conclusions than a constant
   selection-coefficient population genetic approach. The origin of female
   choosiness is argued to lie in a general tendency to avoid sick
   individuals, even in the absence of showy traits, which originate as
   exaggerations of normal traits that are indicative of good health
   (bright feathers, vigorous movement, large size). Thus, in this new
   model the origins of both showy traits and female choosiness are not
   problematic and there is no threshold effect. This model predicts that
   when the possession of male showy traits does not help to reduce disease
   in the female, showy traits are unlikely to occur. This case corresponds
   to thorough exposure of every animal to all group pathogens, on average,
   in large groups. Such species are shown with a large data set on birds
   to be less likely to exhibit showy traits. The good-genes model does not
   make this prediction. The pathogen transmission avoidance model can also
   lead to the evolution of showy traits even when selection is not
   effective against a given pathogen (e.g. when there is no heritable
   variation for resistance), but can result in selection for resistance if
   such genes are present. Monogamy is argued to reduce selection pressures
   for showy traits; data show monogamous species to be both less
   parasitized and less showy. Overall, the pathogen transmission avoidance
   hypothesis provides a complete alternative to the good-genes theory and
   makes new predictions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{155-167}},

Abstract = {{Benthic eutrophication often gives origin to qualitative changes in
   marine and estuarine ecosystems, for example the shift in primary
   producers, often followed by changes in species composition and trophic
   structure at other levels. Through time such modifications may determine
   a selected new trophic structure. The development of structural dynamic
   models will allow to simulate such changes, using goal functions to
   guide ecosystem behaviour and development. The selection of other
   species and other food web may then be accounted by a continuous
   optimisation of model parameters according to an ecological goal
   function. Exergy has been applied in structural dynamic models of
   shallow lakes, and appears to be one of the most promising approaches.
   Theoretically, exergy is assumed to become optimised during ecosystems
   development, and ecosystems are supposed to self organise towards a
   state of an optimal configuration of this property. Exergy may then
   constitute not only a suitable system-oriented characteristic to express
   natural tendencies of ecosystems evolution, but also a good ecological
   indicator of ecosystems health. Biodiversity is also an important
   characteristic of ecosystems structure, constituting a powerful and
   traditional concept, which was found to be suitable to test the
   intrinsic ecological significance of exergy. We examined the properties
   of exergy (exergy and specific exergy) and biodiversity (species
   richness and heterogeneity) along an estuarine gradient of
   eutrophication, testing the hypothesis that they would follow the same
   trends in space and time. This hypothesis was validated in a certain
   extent, with exergy, specific exergy and species richness decreasing as
   a function of increasing eutrophication, but heterogeneity responding
   differently. Biodiversity measurements and their interpretation appeared
   subjective. Exergy and specific exergy may be a suitable alternative,
   that could be used as goal functions in ecological models and as
   holistic ecological indicators of ecosystems integrity. Nevertheless,
   since exergy and specific exergy showed to respond differently to
   ecosystems seasonal dynamics, it is advisable to use both complementary.
   The method proposed by Jorgensen et al. (1995) to estimate exergy, which
   takes into account the biomass of organisms and the thermodynamic
   information due to genes, appeared to be operational. There is
   nevertheless an obvious need for the determination of more accurate
   (discrete) weighing factors to estimate exergy from organisms biomass.
   We propose to explore the assumption that the dimension of active
   genomes, which are primarily a function of the required genetic
   information to build up an organism? are proportional to the relative
   contents of DNA in different organisms. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Global climate change is expected to affect temperature and
   precipitation patterns, oceanic and atmospheric circulation, rate of
   rising sea level, and the frequency, intensity, timing, and distribution
   of hurricanes and tropical storms. The magnitude of these projected
   physical changes and their subsequent impacts on coastal wetlands will
   vary regionally. Coastal wetlands in the southeastern United States have
   naturally evolved under a regime of rising sea level and specific
   patterns of hurricane frequency, intensity, and timing. A review of
   known ecological effects of tropical storms and hurricanes indicates
   that storm timing, frequency, and intensity can alter coastal wetland
   hydrology, geomorphology, biotic structure, energetics, and nutrient
   cycling. Research conducted to examine the impacts of Hurricane Hugo on
   colonial waterbirds highlights the importance of longterm studies for
   identifying complex interactions that may otherwise be dismissed as
   stochastic processes.
   Rising sea level and even modest changes in the frequency, intensity,
   timing, and distribution of tropical storms and hurricanes are expected
   to have substantial impacts on coastal wetland patterns and processes.
   Persistence of coastal wetlands will be determined by the interactions
   of climate and anthropogenic effects, especially how humans respond to
   rising sea level and how further human encroachment on coastal wetlands
   affects resource exploitation, pollution, and water use. Long-term
   changes in the frequency, intensity, timing, and distribution of
   hurricanes and tropical storms will likely affect biotic functions
   (e.g., community structure, natural selection, extinction rates, and
   biodiversity) as well as underlying processes such as nutrient cycling
   and primary and secondary productivity.
   Reliable predictions of global-change impacts on coastal wetlands will
   require better understanding of the linkages among terrestrial, aquatic,
   wetland, atmospheric, oceanic, and human components. Developing this
   comprehensive understanding of the ecological ramifications of global
   change will necessitate close coordination among scientists from
   multiple disciplines and a balanced mixture of appropriate scientific
   approaches. For example, insights may be gained through the careful
   design and implementation of broad-scale comparative studies that
   incorporate salient patterns and processes, including treatment of
   anthropogenic influences. Well-designed, broad-scale comparative studies
   could serve as the scientific framework for developing relevant and
   focused long-term ecological research, monitoring programs, experiments,
   and modeling studies. Two conceptual models of broad-scale comparative
   research for assessing ecological responses to climate change are
   presented: utilizing space-for-time substitution coupled with long-term
   studies to assess impacts of rising sea level and disturbance on coastal
   wetlands, and utilizing the moisture-continuum model for assessing the
   effects of global change and associated shifts in moisture regimes on
   wetland ecosystems. Increased understanding of climate change will
   require concerted scientific efforts aimed at facilitating
   interdisciplinary research, enhancing data and information management,
   and developing new funding strategies.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the bird communities of a set of 12 7-yr-old forested
   landbridge islands in Lago Curl, a 4300 km(2) hydroelectric impoundment
   in the State of Bolivar, Venezuela. Birds were censused on all islands
   and at mainland control sites by spot mapping in 1993, and via point
   counts in 1995. Instead of orderly `'nested sets'' of species on
   landmasses of graded size, the species composition of small (approximate
   to 1 ha) and medium (11-12 ha) islands was highly variable. Spot mapping
   substantiated the occurrence of 58 species of forest-nesting birds,
   collectively, on the 11 small and medium islands, which supported means
   of only 9 and 12 resident species, respectively. No species was found on
   all islands, and only five species were found on as many as 7 of the 11
   small and medium islands. The mean number of islands per resident
   species was 3.0 for the 11 islands. Transients of many species were
   detected on all islands, but were more frequent on near (less than or
   equal to 0.5 km from a larger landmass) than on far islands (greater
   than or equal to 1.0 km from a larger landmass). A large majority of the
   populations on the 1-ha islands consisted of a single pair, implying
   that few such populations could have survived since isolation without
   new colonizations to replenish individuals lost to dispersal and
   mortality.
   Notwithstanding low species numbers, both census methods indicated that
   avian densities were approximately twice as high on the 1-ha islands as
   on the mainland. In contrast, two of three medium-sized islands
   supported anomalously low densities of approximately one-fifth the
   mainland level. Both islands retain relict populations of capuchin
   monkeys (Cebus olivaceus). One hundred percent of artificial nests set
   out on one of these islands were raided, whereas no more than 30\% of
   nests were lost on any of the other islands or on the mainland. For
   small and medium islands, we conclude that the founding communities
   present when the waters of Lago Curl reached their final level have
   already collapsed and been reconstituted. Species loss on some islands
   may have been accelerated by relict populations of predators, such as
   capuchins. Changes in composition thus appear to have been driven by a
   combination of biological (nest predation) and stochastic processes
   (high turnover).}},

Abstract = {{Loranthaceous mistletoes are interesting because of their complex
   dependence on suitable host trees nad avian dispersers and because of
   their patchy distribution at the landscape level. Although their over-
   and under-abundance in Australia and New Zealand have been widely
   documented, little attention has been given to the need of an ecosystem
   approach to their management. Although the current status of mistletoes
   is very different in Australia and New Zealand, some of the causal
   factors and the long-term effects of changes in mistletoe abundance are
   similar in the two countries. We suggest that mistletoe abundance in
   pre-European landscapes was dependent on a series of evolutionary and
   environmental filters relating to host specificity, pollination,
   dispersal, infection, environmental habitat quality, predation, and
   disturbance. European settlement modified there filters in a number of
   ways, resulting in either increases or decreases in mistletoe abundance.
   The three broad groups of changes that have occurred with European
   settlement involve fragmentation, predation, and altered disturbance
   regimes. Although managers have usually addressed mistletoe over- or
   under-abundance with short-term solutions (e.g., pruning infected
   trees), we suggest that management must address the underlying causes of
   the problems involving mistletoes. This requires an ecosystem approach
   to management that addresses both the direct and indirect causes of the
   current status of mistletoes.}},

Abstract = {{The neutral hypothesis of molecular evolution predicts that there should
   be a 1:1 ratio between allozymes in a species which are faster or slower

   are presented in this paper for estimating selective differentials from
   observed values of r, the deviation from a fraction of 1/2 in the
   proportion of substitutions conferring a mobility change in a specified
   direction. Although the methods were developed for allozymes, they are
   readily applied to cases where two taxa may differ in other properties,
   such as DNA sequence. r is related to the selection coefficient s under
   a `genic selection' model. If a change in one direction is favoured in
   one species and a change in the other direction is equally favoured in
   the second species, both s and N are assumed constant and only one
   substitution has occurred at each locus, then the estimate of s is
   approximately (ln(1/2+r)-ln(1/2-r))/4N. If selective coefficients follow
   an unspecified distribution f(s) and N is assumed constant, then the
   average value of s lies between r/2N(1/2 + r) and r/2N(1/2 - r).
   Specifying the distribution of s to enable point estimation of E(s) is
   mathematically difficult for the usual probability density functions. A
   new family of distributions is suggested to overcome these difficulties.
   The analysis is extended to cover estimation of r where more than one
   substitution has occurred. The range of the various estimates of s
   provided by these methods from electrophoretic data is usually below 1/N
   and mostly substantially so.}},

   Fourteen years of work by a multidisciplinary team and the utilization
   of some little-used data sources (notary deeds, nominative censuses),
   make the considerable scope of these changes evident. First, wetlands
   have been altered by human activities to the point that alder scrub is
   invading the marshes and black spruce has been eradicated from the bogs.
   Secondly, after a rapid expansion during the 19th century, agricultural
   use is now in steady decline on areas covered by morainic deposits.
   Thirdly, forest exploitation has changed precolonial vegetation to the
   point that what was once perceived as a climatic climax (sugar
   maple-hickory) is now understood to be an anthropic climax. Overall, the
   various studies discussed in this paper lead to the conclusion that
   today's Haut-Saint-Laurent landscapes are in need of reconstruction.

Abstract = {{Since the early 1980s several new approaches towards forest management,
   which include active participation of local communities, have been tried
   out in many tropical regions. As a result of these efforts recognition
   has increased about the various ways in which many local communities are
   already actively managing their forest resources. The planning of
   development interventions to stimulate more efficient community
   involvement in forest management can often be based on such indigenous
   forest management systems. This paper aims to improve the understanding
   about the diversity and dynamics of indigenous forest management. The
   analysis consists of three parts. First an overview of the various types
   of indigenous forest management and their dynamics is presented.
   Subsequently, the basic principles of forest management are discussed.
   Forest management is characterized as involving a set of both technical
   activities and social arrangements for the protection and utilization of
   forest resources and the distribution of forest products. Three major
   categories of forest management practices are identified, e.g.
   controlled utilization of forest products, protection and maintenance of
   forest stands, and purposeful regeneration. The practices in the first
   category are both socially and biologically oriented, whereas the
   activities of the last two categories are biologically oriented. These
   principles are then used to develop a classification model of the
   various evolutionary phases in forest management. Along the lines of a
   similar model developed for exploitation of agricultural crops, various
   stages of forest management are distinguished along a gradient of
   increasing input of human energy per unit of exploited forest. This
   gradient represents a continuum of forest-people interactions; it
   illustrates how the various manifestations of indigenous forest
   management may be arranged along a nature-culture continuum. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{A novel dendroecological procedure was developed to elucidate canopy
   disturbances spanning a >300-yr period for oak (Quercus> forests of
   central Pennsylvania. Running comparisons of sequential 10-yr ring-width
   averages may effectively neutralize both short-term (i.e., drought) and
   long-term growth trends associated with climate while enhancing
   detection of abrupt and sustained radial-growth increases characteristic
   of canopy disturbance. Thinning-response studies revealed the
   conservative tendencies of overstory oak, with substantial basal area
   reductions (>1/3) required to attain moderate and consistently
   detectable growth increases. Based on empirical evidence, a minimum
   growth-response threshold of 25\% was established to depict canopy
   disturbances. This is in contrast to the 50-100\% sustained
   radial-growth release often used to detect disturbance using understory
   trees in closed forests. Our default threshold was adjusted higher as
   necessary for those trees highly correlated to climatic trends (as
   represented by the Palmer drought severity index). Canopy disturbances
   detected with this dendroecological approach were further substantiated
   using tree-recruitment data (age cohorting). By coupling these data
   sets, we estimated return intervals of standwide disturbance from 21 yr
   in presettlement times (prior to 1775) and during heavy Euro-American
   exploitation (1775-1900) to 31 yr in modern times (after 1900). Although
   disturbance periodicity remained stable between presettlement and early
   post-settlement (exploitation) eras, the mode of disturbance shifted
   from mainly natural (wind and fire) to anthropogenic forces (intense
   harvesting for charcoal production), based on the historical record. In
   the process, presettlement oak-pine (Pinus)-chestnut (Castanea) forests
   on ridges were rapidly converted to young coppice stands of oak and
   chestnut. The reduction of harvesting and fire events coupled with the
   eradication of chestnut by blight this century have allowed these
   coppice stands to mature into oak-dominated forests that exist today.
   This analytical technique for ascertaining disturbance histories holds
   much potential and should be considered for use with mature, overstory
   trees in other forest types with appropriate modifications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers problems associated with the artificial flooding of
   floodplain forests in an industrial region in central Germany. During
   the past eight centuries river regulation has reduced flooding to an
   extent dependent on local conditions. The lack of flooding has caused a
   new pedo-hydrological regime. Typical tree mixtures in the floodplain
   forests of oak, ash, elm and maple have changed over the last 120 years
   so that ash and maple now dominate. Sediments of the rivers Weisse
   Elster and Mulde were found to be contaminated by industrial pollutants,
   especially with heavy metals such as Cd, Zn, Co and Cr. Atmospheric
   pollution and the deposition of dust and gas contaminated by heavy
   metals over the last 100 years have been responsible for serious soil
   contamination. There is a danger of the migration of these heavy metals
   through the floodplain sediments and soils into groundwater. Artificial
   flooding is one method of re-introducing natural conditions to
   floodplains and their forests. Our investigations of the migration
   behaviour of contaminants, using sequential leaching procedures, have
   demonstrated that a high proportion of the stored heavy metals in the
   meadow loams is soluble and highly mobile. The release of heavy metals
   in the soils depends on the pH-value and grain size of the soils as well
   as precipitation and climatic conditions. The mobility of the heavy
   metals increases with rising acidification of the soils. Despite
   decreasing atmospheric deposition in the region of Bitterfeld and
   reduced deposition of basic flue ashes after the year 1990, increased
   mobilization of metals in the hood loams is likely to take place. The
   migration of these chemicals to groundwater is likely to be increased by
   water infiltrating from artificial flooding. Artificial flooding may
   therefore have previously unforeseen negative consequences.}},

   for the study of small-scale community pattern, a new procedure is
   suggested for elucidating multi-species point patterns based on
   digitized field data. The method utilizes nested circular plots with
   increasing radii drawn around each individual and determines changes in
   floristic composition along this space series. The information provided
   by detecting the species composition around the sample plant is
   calculated, and its observed mean for all individuals is compared, for
   each radius, to the expectation under the null model, i.e. for complete
   spatial randomness of all points. The departure from randomness is
   illustrated by conventional profile diagrams and is tested for
   significance based on confidence envelopes simulated by Monte Carlo
   methods. One advantage of the individual-centered sampling strategy is
   that the role of each species in influencing its own neighbourhood can
   be analyzed separately, providing information for the assessment of
   guild structure and assembly rules in communities. The performance of
   the method is evaluated using artificial and simulated point patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Model evaluation is argued to necessitate the use of a hypothesis
   testing framework instead of the use of goodness-of-fit (GOF) against
   time series data. A test statistic T is developed, based on model
   deviation from expected system behaviors. If a model does not exceed the
   error bounds on expected behavior, then we cannot say that it differs
   from the real system. Precision is measured not by degree of fit to a
   set of data but by the precision (width of confidence limits around) the
   expected system behavior. Implementation of this approach is enhanced by
   development of new test criteria that evaluate biological and ecological
   realism based on aggregate indices, failure modes, extreme condition
   tests, and others. Model performance is assessed by the extent to which
   the model falls within these expected bounds. Using this test statistic
   as a basis, revised approaches to sensitivity and uncertainty analysis
   are recommended. Factors not addressed by these techniques require
   structural analysis, which is based on comparisons between models with
   different structures. The application of the advocated approach should
   enhance confidence in ecosystem models applied to policy issues such as
   natural resource management or global change impacts. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Multi-Dimensional Sphere Model (MDSM), a new method for multivariate
   instantaneous trend analysis, is introduced. The model handles three
   subscript data, Z((i,j,k)) e.g., for vegetation analysis, i, j and k are
   species, quadrats and time, respectively. The MDSM uses species, or
   species groups, as dimensions of a multi-dimensional space, and quadrats
   as points (vectors) in the space. The quadrats are standardized to 1.0
   by division by their vector length, i.e., the square root of the sum of
   the squares of the components of a quadrat, q((i))'=q(i)/root{[}Sigma
   q((i))(2)]. All quadrats are projected onto the unit hypersphere. This
   maintains the composition information of each species for every quadrat
   in the data set, and makes all quadrats comparable because their vector
   lengths equal 1.0. The MDSM synthesizes the quadrats into state vectors
   representing the vegetation, z((i))(')-Sigma q((i,j))'. When performing
   trend analysis, the MDSM defines the quotient of components of previous
   (k-1) and present (k) state vectors as an instantaneous trend at a given
   time. This is referred to as a trend vector, and describes vegetation
   composition change over time, t((k))=z((k))'/z((k-l))'. The components
   of a trend vector (here called the t-value of the species) carry
   information from both previous and present states for species and
   community. This trend can then be extended to predict future states of
   the vegetation, P(k+l)=Z((k)){*}t((k)). The MDSM combines correlation
   analysis, cluster analysis, trend analysis, and prediction of future
   vegetation states, making it a powerful and promising multivariate
   analysis method. The model was tested with data from the Land Condition
   Trend Analysis program at Fort Carson in southeastern Colorado, The
   model shows promising results for vegetation trend analysis; however,

   our understanding, comparison with an additive model and a validation

Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{345-353}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The confidence interval for the map location of quantitative trait loci
   (QTL) is a very important quantity for geneticists. The one LOD support
   interval has been proved to be a biased confidence interval. Moreover
   the distribution of the LOD score has been shown to depend on the value
   of the QTL effect, which is why the LOD score cannot be used to build an
   unbiased confidence interval when the value of the QTL effect is
   unknown. A new confidence interval based on a maximun likelihood ratio
   test and using statistics whose asymptotic distribution does not depend
   on the QTL effect, has been proposed and proved to lead to an
   asymptotically similar confidence interval. The major difficulty of this
   method is the computation of the correct threshold for the maximum
   likelihood ratio test. An approximation for the threshold is proposed in
   this paper. When the value of the QTL effect is known, an unbiased
   confidence region could be built using the LOD score. A simulation study
   is carried out to compare the average length of this region, which is
   unobtainable for an unknown value of the QTL effect, to the average
   length of the asymptotically similar confidence interval. It shows that
   the required property of similarity does not increase the confidence
   interval length significantly for QTL having a small effect, and leads
   to an increase of about 5cM length for a 1 Morgan chromosome when the
   value of the QTL is great. An empirical symmetrical confidence interval
   could be constructed with the empirical distribution function of the
   maximun likelihood estimation for the QTL position. The simulation study
   shows that, when a QTL is detected, the average length of the
   asymptotically similar confidence interval could be half the length of
   the empirical symmetrical one. This great difference can be explained by
   the fact that the asymptotically similar confidence interval is
   dependent of the interval mapping test of detection whereas the
   empirical symmetrical one is independent of the actual data.}},

Title = {{Tissue turnover within grass-clover mixed swards grazed by sheep.
   Methodology for calculating growth, senescence and intake fluxes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{333-348}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. A sustainable, low-input land use might be achieved by the use of
   grazed grass-legume mixtures. However, maintaining the species balance
   has proven to be difficult, especially as grazing provides differential
   defoliation and regrowth. Since changes in the sward botanical
   composition can be ascribed to species differences in growth, senescence
   or intake, a method that yields independent estimates of these three
   fluxes for both components of a grazed grass-legume mixture is needed.
   2. The objective of this paper is to present and assess such a detailed
   tissue turnover method based on non-destructive measurements of
   individually marked population units. This method was applied during two
   spring and summer growing seasons to a ryegrass-clover mixture
   continuously or rotationally grazed by sheep and is assessed using these
   experimental results.
   3. Defoliation was measured on grazed population units (i.e. grass
   tillers; elongated and axillary shoot growing points of clover). To
   calculate the growth rate of defoliated leaves, a sample of ungrazed
   leaves of each defoliation status (with or without previous defoliation)
   was used. Additionally, for clover, a sample of ungrazed leaves of each
   `botanical number' was also required. The mean extension rates of leaves
   that underwent defoliation during an observed period, and of leaves that
   did not, was not significantly different during the preceding period.
   4. The estimates of the mixture growth flux varied by less than 10 and
   17\% when the mean values of the gravimetric coefficients and of the
   density of the population units, respectively, were increased by one
   standard deviation. The net recruitment of new population units led to
   an underestimation of the growth flux by 8 and 5\% with grass and
   clover, respectively.
   5. The method was partially validated, by comparing independent
   estimates of the mean dry-weight of the population units, based either
   on tissue turnover or on destructive measurements. For vegetative
   tillers and elongated clover growing points, both estimates were highly
   correlated with no significant bias.
   6. Although this method is labour intensive, it yields reliable
   estimates of the growth, intake and senescence fluxes, at three
   different levels (square metre, population unit and plant part). Hence,
   a better understanding of the impacts of herbivory on the grass-legume
   balance in a grazed mixture can be gained.}},

Abstract = {{Frequent oil spills associated with oil operations in tropical savannas
   are developing new ecosystems that may be symbiotic interfaces between
   industry and environment. This paper describes these developments, the
   role of restoration efforts and uses `emergy' to evaluate the changes.
   In April 1991, an estimated 36000 barrels (5724 m(3)) of 40 gravity
   crude oil were released into 4600 ha of tropical grassland-scrub and
   palm swamp communities from the blowout of a Venezuelan Oil Company well
   (Corpoven MUC-21) in Monagas State in eastern Venezuela. Ecologic and
   economic impacts of the oil spill were estimated using emergy analysis.
   The oil spill, its damages, and subsequent clean up were evaluated by
   comparing the emergy flows associated with each aspect of the spill and
   ecological restoration. Using emergy measures of solar emjoules (sej)
   and converting to macro-economic dollars (emdollars), total damages
   (including cleanup and spilled oil) amounted to 48.5 E18 sej or 11.3 E6
   US emdollars. Environmental damages to ecosystems and agro-ecosystems
   amounted to about 22\% of the total, while economic losses and costs of
   restoration were about 78\% of the total. The area affected by spilled
   oil was divided into four zones based on post spill treatments and
   amount of spilled oil. The largest ecological impact was to a lightly
   oiled zone (about 4500 ha) but was relatively short lived having
   recovered ecological productivity (GPP) within 30 days. A zone where
   heavily oiled soil was removed (9 ha) and a third zone where heavy
   surface oil was burned (80 ha) made up a smaller fraction of total
   losses. The zone with soil removal was estimated to require about 15 yrs
   to recover, while the area that was burned was estimated to recover in
   about 10 yrs. A fourth zone that was heavily oiled but received no
   further treatments (11 ha) exhibited the smallest total losses and
   recovery was estimated to require only 5 yrs. A method is suggested for
   evaluating the benefit/cost ratio of ecological restoration projects
   using the four zones for comparative purposes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Predicting the distribution of endangered species from habitat data is
   frequently perceived to be a useful technique. Models that predict the
   presence or absence of a species are normally judged by the number of
   prediction errors. These may be of two types: false positives and false
   negatives. Many of the prediction errors can be traced to ecological
   processes such as unsaturated habitat and species interactions.
   Consequently, if prediction errors are not placed in an ecological
   context the results of the model may be misleading. The simplest, and
   most widely used, measure of prediction accuracy is the number of
   correctly classified cases. There are other measures of prediction
   success that may be more appropriate. Strategies for assessing the
   causes and costs of these errors are discussed. A range of techniques
   for measuring error in presence/absence models, including some that are
   seldom used by ecologists (e.g. ROC plots and cost matrices), are
   described. A new approach to estimating prediction error, which is based
   on the spatial characteristics of the errors, is proposed. Thirteen

Abstract = {{Variability in the spatial and temporal patterns of stream biota has
   been well documented, yet the causes and consequences of this
   variability are poorly understood. Most early work focused on how
   changes in mean environmental parameters over space or time influence
   the abundance or distribution patterns of biota. We argue for an
   increased focus on the study of variability in these parameters. To
   date, only a few lotic studies have used variance as a dependent
   variable i.e., showing that changes in the variance in some parameter
   can be related to changes in the mean of that or another parameter.
   These studies have suggested interesting links between ecological
   patterns and processes at a variety of scales. The use of variance as an
   independent variable and its experimental manipulation (i.e., hold the
   mean of some parameter constant while altering its variance) may also
   lead to new understandings of how pattern and process are linked. We
   begin by outlining when and why the study of variance may be important
   to lotic ecology. Next, we suggest a 3-step process in the use of
   variance in stream studies: 1) documentation of a pattern with respect
   to variance; 2) examination of descriptive data to explore potential
   causes of the pattern; and 3) direct manipulation of variance in
   experiments. We provide an example of this 3-step process using data
   from preliminary experiments in it warmwater stream that suggested
   spatial variability in the abundance of chironomids and copepods could
   be related to flow variability We close by suggesting that future
   directions for the use of variance in stream ecology should attempt to
   couple scale-dependent physical patterns with biological patterns or
   processes, develop experimental frameworks to determine if species
   interactions or other biotic processes vary with scale, embrace
   statistical methods for determining the relative importance of
   variance-generating processes, develop methods for the quantification of
   variance in biologically meaningful ways, and focus on the
   identification and interpretation of domains of homogeneous variance in

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Males and females are at a selective disadvantage relative to
   hermaphrodites (cosexuals) in species with a colonizing habit, as only
   cosexuals are able to establish new colonies on their own. The
   implications of this disadvantage are assessed by means of a computer
   model of metapopulation dynamics, in which individual colonies are
   established through different rates of immigration and suffer different
   rates of local extinction. Results are given for simulations of an
   island model, a stepping-stone model, and for a partial analysis of the
   island model with simplifying assumptions. It is shown that: (1)
   unisexual frequencies in a metapopulation can be reasonably approximated
   by a linear function of the logarithm of the ratio of the immigration
   rate to the colony extinction rate; (2) metapopulation dynamics favor
   the maintenance of females (gynodioecy) over males (androdioecy) with
   cosexuals when they would otherwise be equally likely in a panmictic
   situation; (3) the way in which extinction and immigration rates affect
   unisexual frequencies at metapopulation equilibrium interacts with
   whether sterility is determined by a dominant or a recessive allele; and
   (4) unisexual frequencies are affected in a qualitatively similar way by
   the dynamics of a metapopulation when cosexuals are self-incompatible to
   when they are self-compatible, although only in the former case are high
   frequencies of unisexuals maintained when extinction and colonization
   rates approach the threshold at which the metapopulation goes extinct.
   These results are discussed with reference to existing data from species

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. In the mid-1970s, Hynes (1975) wrote eloquently about the complex
   interactions between aquatic and terrestrial systems. Central theories
   in stream ecology developed thereafter have dealt with the longitudinal
   flow of energy, materials and organisms in streams, and, with the
   exception of the flood pulse concept (Junk, Bayley \& Sparks, 1989),
   have largely ignored areas outside the riparian zone. The structure of
   the upland and activities occurring there play a more important part
   than previously recognized in regulating community structure and
   ecosystem processes in streams.
   2. These new perspectives are made possible by developments in hierarchy
   theory, patch dynamics, and the refinement of tools used to quantify
   spatial and temporal heterogeneity.
   3. Geographical information systems (GIS), image processing technology
   and spatial statistical techniques allow quantitative assessment of
   lateral, longitudinal and vertical components of the landscape that
   interact at several spatial and temporal scales to influence streams.
   When GIS is used in concert with geostatistics, multivariate statistics,
   or landscape models, complex relationships can be elucidated and
   predicted.
   4. To a certain extent, the tools discussed above have only automated
   functions that were previously performed manually. This suite of tools
   has improved the ability of aquatic ecologists to examine relationships
   and test theories over larger, more heterogeneous regions than were
   previously possible.
   5. At the local, state and federal level, management and regulatory
   frameworks are currently being re-evaluated to incorporate this new
   perspective in resource management and policy decision making.
   6. We will discuss current and future trends in technologies and tools
   used for aquatic ecosystem research, and the use of techniques as they
   are applied in these regional assessments are also discussed.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. This paper introduces a new approach for setting streamflow-based
   river ecosystem management targets and this method is called the `Range
   of Variability Approach' (RVA). The proposed approach derives from
   aquatic ecology theory concerning the critical role of hydrological
   variability, and associated characteristics of timing, frequency,
   duration, and rates of change, in sustaining aquatic ecosystems. The
   method is intended for application on rivers wherein the conservation of
   native aquatic biodiversity and protection of natural ecosystem
   functions are primary river management objectives.
   2. The RVA uses as its starting point either measured or synthesized
   daily streamflow values from a period during which human perturbations
   to the hydrological regime were negligible. This streamflow record is
   then characterized using thirty-two different hydrological parameters,
   using methods defined in Richter et al. (1996). Using the RVA, a range
   of variation in each of the thirty-two parameters, e.g. the values at
   +/- 1 standard deviation from the mean or the twenty-fifth to
   seventy-fifth percentile range, are selected as initial flow management
   targets.
   3. The RVA targets are intended to guide the design of river management
   strategies(e.g. reservoir operations rules, catchment restoration) that
   will lead to attainment of these targets on an annual basis. The RVA
   will enable river managers to define and adopt readily interim
   management targets before conclusive, long-term ecosystem research
   results are available. The RVA targets and management strategies should
   be adaptively refined as suggested by research results and as needed to
   sustain native aquatic ecosystem biodiversity and integrity.}},

Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a novel CO2 exposure system for natural vegetation
   that is a middle ground between Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) and
   traditional open-top chambers (OTC). Screen-Aided CO2 Control (SACC)
   technology uses much less CO2 per experiment and per replicate than FACE
   and is superior to OTCs in terms of its effects on microclimate. A SACC
   unit consists of a thin metal frame, a clear plastic `'screen'', and a
   pipe at the base of the screen through which CO2 enriched jets of air
   are directed into the unit. There is a gap between the ground and the
   bottom of the pipe and the screen is relatively short in comparison to
   the maximum height of the vegetation. Our SACC units are hexagonal and
   enclose a ground area of 1.27 m(2). SACC works in the following way: 1)
   the screen breaks the wind and creates turbulent mixing within the unit,
   2) the mixing of the outside air with the CO2 enriched jets of
   air,generates relatively uniform CO2 concentrations within the
   screened-in vegetation, and 3) a fully automated system monitors CO2
   concentrations and adjusts CO2 injection rates for each unit every ca.
   IO minutes to maintain preset CO2 concentrations.
   Twenty-four hour means of CO2 concentrations in the middle of a unit are
   typically maintained within 1 mu l l(-1) of their set points. Spatial
   variation and short-term fluctuations in CO2 concentration are similar
   to those in OTCs and FACE. CO2 consumption at our site is 5 kg CO2
   day(-1) replicate(-1) for a total of ca. 30 tons per year for 20
   elevated CO2 SACC units. Compared to OTCs, SACC units have reduced
   temperature peaks at full sunlight, minimal effects on solar radiation,
   reduced rainfall interception by chamber walls, and freer access of

Abstract = {{In an attempt to overcome the lack of control of germination during
   traditional prechilling of Abies nordmanniana seeds, an investigation on
   the effect of reduced seed moisture content (m.c.) on the rate of
   dormancy breakage and radicle protrusion was carried out. Reduced m.c.
   delayed radicle protrusion and reduced the fraction of germinated seeds.
   At 33\% m.c, fresh weight basis (f.w) no radicle protrusion was seen
   even after a prolonged period at +4 degrees C. Germination capacity
   (GC), and mean time to germination (MGT), were calculated from seeds
   prechilled at eight m.c, levels for different durations and then
   germinated at 25 degrees C. Reduced m.c, resulted in a decrease in the
   rate of dormancy breaking, quantified as a lower increase in GC or lower
   reduction in MGT during the first weeks of prechilling, The critical
   lower m.c. threshold for dormancy breaking was around 23\%. Combining
   the results it was concluded that prechilling of Abies nordmanniana
   seeds at a controlled m.c. of 33\% allowed the release of dormancy in
   all seeds in the seedlot without any germination during the prechilling
   treatment. By introducing a higher degree of control the new method
   means improved germination capacity and an easier and more reliable
   dormancy breaking method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to project quantitatively the possible
   impacts of climatic change on mountain forests at high temporal (annual
   cycle), spatial, and qualitative resolution. It allows linkage from
   global scenarios simulated by climate models through local climatic
   scenarios to stand-specific forest models. The method was applied to
   four representative sites in the Alps using the CCC-GCMII climate model,
   a statistical procedure to downscale GCM-output to the regional scale,
   and the forest patch model FORCLIM. Sharply contrasting forest responses
   were observed within short distances under the same 2xCO(2) scenario of
   radiative forcing. While some forest simulations produced only small
   changes in tree species composition, others produced major changes even
   to the point of a complete disappearance of the forest. In some cases
   new species assemblages emerged without any analogue under present
   conditions. The results suggest that some mountain forests are sensitive
   to a 2xCO(2) global change, and that human assistance may be required to
   help forests to adapt. The proposed method made good use of existing
   data, integrated current understanding, and appears sufficiently
   flexible and general to assess impacts of climatic change on any mid to

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{77-88}},
Abstract = {{Diatom aggregation can increase the sedimentation rate of the intense
   pulses of carbon formed during diatom blooms. Laboratory studies of
   aggregation dynamics have been troubled by the unavoidable disruption of
   aggregates in laboratory flocculators due to subsampling and electronic
   particle counting. Aggregate disruption prevents accurate measurement of
   aggregation rate and makes observation of particle structure impossible.
   This led us to develop a new non-disruptive method to quantify diatom
   aggregation using high-resolution video and image analysis. The system
   easily resolved cells of Chaetoceros neogracile 6 to 8 mu m in diameter,
   and facilitated observations of aggregate morphology. C. neogracile made
   either ball-like or net-like aggregates depending on culture density and
   physiological state. Only the net like aggregates reached a substantial
   size (>1 mm). A Si-limited batch culture experiment indicated that
   stickiness of C. neogracile increased significantly with increasing
   severity of nutrient limitation. This increase was not detectable by the
   subsampling and electronic particle counting method. It is likely that
   spine formation, cell-surface bound sugars, and transparent exopolymer
   particles all played a role in determining aggregate structure and
   changes in stickiness. The stickiness calculation model assumes cultures
   are initially suspensions of single cells which form doublets as they
   aggregate. This assumption was tested by comparing mean particle size in
   a culture with the percentage of tells in aggregates as determined using
   nearest neighbor distances, allowing us to assess the mean number of
   cells per aggregate. C. neogracile commonly formed aggregates containing
   anywhere between 2 and 10 cells showing that model assumptions can be
   violated under normal experimental conditions. A larger field of view
   was necessary to estimate the larger particle sizes typical of coastal
   diatom blooms.}},

   various natural foods. With the exception of lipase and phosphatase, K-m
   values were between 15 and 30 mmol l(-1), independent of prefeeding.

Abstract = {{Coral reefs have reconstituted themselves after previous large sea-level
   variations, and climate changes. For the past 6000 years of unusually
   stable sea-level, reefs have grown without serious interruptions. During
   recent decades, however, new stresses threaten localized devastation of
   many reefs. A new period of global climate change is occurring,
   stimulated by anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. Coral reefs
   will cope well with predicted sea-level rises of 4.5 cm per decade, but
   reef islands will not. Higher sea levels will provide corals with
   greater room for growth across reef flats, but there are no foreseeable
   mechanisms for reef island growth to keep pace with sea-level rise,
   therefore many low islands may ultimately become uninhabitable.
   Climate change will introduce localized variations in weather patterns,
   but changes to individual reefs cannot be predicted. Reefs on average
   should cope well with regional climate change, as they have coped with
   similar previous fluctuations. Air temperature increases of 0.2-0.3
   degrees C/decade will induce slower increases in sea-surface
   temperatures, which may cause localized, or regional increases in coral
   bleaching. Changes in rainfall will impact on reefs near land masses.
   Likewise, increased storms and variations in El Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) may stress some reefs, but not others.
   The greatest impact of climate change will be a synergistic enhancement
   of direct anthropogenic stresses (excessive sediment and pollution from
   the land; over-fishing, especially via destructive methods; mining of
   coral rock and sand; and engineering modifications), which currently
   cause most damage to coral reefs. Many of the world's reefs have been
   degraded and more will be damaged as anthropogenic impacts increase
   under the `demophoric' increases in population (demos) and economic
   (phoric) activity. This biotic and habitat loss will result in severe
   economic and social losses. Reefs, however, have considerable recovery
   powers and losses can be minimized by effective management of direct
   human impacts and reducing indirect threats of global climate change.}},

Abstract = {{High species diversity in samples of macrobenthos of deep-sea sediments
   is now well established. But a consensus on the processes regulating
   this unexpectedly species-rich coexistence in metazoan species at the
   deep-sea bed is still elusive. This review takes a broad approach by
   examining differences between marine and terrestrial biodiversity in the
   context of the following: scale of sampling effort on which our
   knowledge is based; the species concept as applied in the past to
   taxonomic studies on deep-sea benthic organisms; scaling differences and
   size related patterns in community structure and habitat complexity and
   differences in potential for co-evolution. Latitudinal and bathymetric
   patterns are summarised in relation to habitat variability and
   distributional range and in relation to J.S. Gray's (1994) claim that
   benthic diversity may be equally high on the continental shelf.
   Evidence is first reviewed for neo-Darwinian competitive co-existence
   based on niche specialisation and habitat partitioning. Although
   evidence for any dietary specialisation is sparse, biologically
   generated heterogeneity in the sediment, such as from mounds, burrows,
   tubes and `mud balls', will persist longer and contribute more to niche
   diversification than in shallow water owing to slower obliteration by
   sedimentation and water turbulence.
   Second, the role of periodic small-scale disturbance in creating a
   shifting dynamic of invasion and species succession in patches of new,
   open habitat, is reviewed in relation to data from sea bed observations
   and experiments. Such disturbances may arise from effects ranging from
   organic enrichment as falls of carcases or dead plants, seaweed or wood,
   to patchy phytodetrital deposition from the surface. Environmental
   patchiness of both kinds may be important in determining small scale,
   predominantly non-competitive co-existence, particularly in a habitat
   lacking large-scale isolating barriers and open to chance, low-intensity
   recruitment from propagules of a wide taxonomic and functional spectrum
   of biota. Disturbance may also be expressed as diffuse, large-scale
   effects caused by sea bed currents. At their most extreme, `benthic
   storms' erode and re-deposit sediment and create a regime of
   intermittent disturbance that reduces species richness; but more
   moderate Flow may enhance recruitment and remould the small-scale
   sediment landscape to create new habitat.
   The wide range in habitat partitioning and disturbance processes that
   may be involved in controlling species richness make realistic modelling
   studies challenging. Careful description of the full spatio-temporal
   range in environmental hetergeneity at the deep-sea bed is badly needed.
   Further manipulative experiments, and perhaps pilot `industrial'-scale
   studies involving laying bulky inert or organically enriched waste on
   the bed, will certainly also be useful in improving our knowledge of
   processes controlling deep-sea macrobenthic species richness.}},

Abstract = {{The sequence of morphological changes through intervals from the time of
   egg insemination until the time of completed yolk absorption was
   investigated. The studied time span was divided into more than 100
   morphologically discrete states. For this purpose, some quantitative
   characters, such as number of cells, somite pairs, or caudal fin rays,
   extent of epiboly, or vascularisation, were selected as key characters,
   since they seem to provide the most adequate picture of the dynamic
   developmental process. Descriptions and drawings of 41 states (out of
   the more than 100) were chosen for the present study to illustrate the
   embryo and alevin periods. The time it takes to form one somite pair
   (tau(s)) was used as the unit of relative age and duration of the early
   ontogenetic states. The morphological description of each state was
   supplemented by the estimation of the relative age of the embryo or
   alevin at this state as the value of N/tau(s), where N is the time
   elapsed from egg insemination up to any given state at a given constant
   temperature. It was determined that the developmental rate of Atlantic
   salmon embryos depends on the incubation temperature according to the
   equation:
   Ig N-t = Ig N-o + (-0.0967 + 0.00207t)t,
   where N-o and N-t are values of tau(s) at temperatures of 0 and t
   (degrees C), respectively, taking into account that the values of tau(s)
   and the duration of the entire embryogenesis vary proportionally within
   the temperature range tolerated by the species. The methods used here to
   identify states of embryogenesis and to estimate the relative age of S.

Abstract = {{Starting with a sinusoidal birth function, we derive an explicit
   expression for the associated wave of net maternity (R(t)). The phase
   shift and relative amplification of R(t) depend heavily on the cycle
   length of oscillation (T) relative to the mean age of net maternity (mu)
   and on the amplitude of oscillation of the birth function. For short
   cycle lengths (up to about 12 years), the birth and R(t) functions are
   virtually identical. When the cycle length is long (over 120 years),
   R(t) is essentially equal to the ratio of the number of births at time t
   to that at time t--mu. The R(t) function oscillates with the same cycle
   length as the birth function, but it is not sinusoidal and its asymmetry
   increases as the amplitude of birth function increases. This paper
   breaks new ground by providing a complete description of the dynamics of

Abstract = {{Conflicts between local people and managers of protected areas (PAs)
   have often undermined conservation goals in Asia. Since the 1970s,
   conservation planners have tried to address these problems by
   incorporating rural development into PA planning. More recently, many
   conservationists have argued for increasing community involvement in PA
   management, and for allowing traditional resource uses inside PAs. Based
   on research in Thailand I make three arguments regarding obstacles to
   implementing the new approach.
   In Thailand, laws governing Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Parks
   enacted in the early 1960s were premised on the idea that human use and
   nature preservation were incompatible. Rapid expansion of these PAs in
   recent years has produced endemic conflict with rural people claiming
   resources inside PAs. To address this problem, the Thai Royal Forestry
   Department has cooperated with NGOs providing development assistance to
   rural people living in buffer zones outside of some PAs. I argue that
   this approach has met limited success because the main source of
   conflict is not poverty but claims on resources inside PAs.
   The second argument is that the Forestry Department has resisted changes
   to laws making local use inside PAs illegal because these laws are
   important for consolidating the Department's control over territory and
   in justifying increasing budgetary allocations. In addition, by
   redefining itself as an organization devoted to strict defence of
   forests, the Department has obtained the support of many urban
   environmentalists. The third argument is that the community forest
   approach taken by a recent draft Community Forest Bill is an important
   first step in that it implicitly recognizes community property. At the
   same time, this approach will also fail to address key problems because
   it is based on a notion of the traditional village, and does not allow
   for the commercial nature of rural forest use or the household-based
   nature of forest tenure.
   I suggest that the new expansion of PAs be halted, that land claimed by
   rural households be taken out of PAs, and that the government recognize
   community management rights in areas that remain classified as
   protected. More generally, the goals of conservation would be better
   achieved by replacing an approach based on the rapid expansion of PAs
   with one promoting conservation outside PAs.}},

Abstract = {{Fringing many of the mountain ranges in south central New Mexico is a
   zone of large (>5 m high) dead alligator junipers (Juniperus deppeana)
   that are as much as 100 m lower in elevation than similar-sized live
   trees. Employing tree-ring to diameter correlated ages, the point
   quarter method, and elevation values, we analyzed the age, elevation,
   and socioecology of J. deppeana along a transect from 1520 m to 1690 m
   elevation on the east slope of the Organ Mountains, New Mexico. For
   trees established before 1890, there has been an 80 m upward
   displacement of their lower treeline whereas younger trees have not
   experienced a similar die off. From the late 1800s to 1943 the region
   experienced an eleven-fold increase in livestock, episodes of fuelwood
   cutting, and intense, droughts of less than seven years. Precipitation
   records document that the 1943-1971 period (with a 39 percent decrease
   in precipitation) was the longest drought period to affect the region
   since continuous precipitation records were initiated in the region; the
   1947-1956 decade was 46 percent drier than the 1890 to 1991 mean.
   Tree-ring records indicate that 1950-1959 was the driest decade since
   680 AD. During the 1943-1971 drought, the occasional wetter years
   produced major episodes of J. deppeana establishment; 36 of the 72
   sampled trees were established in six isolated events during the
   1943-1971 drought. Trees were established at lower elevations during the
   1943-1971 drought than were established during the post-1971 `'mesic''
   period. Favorable conditions for establishment and survival of younger
   trees were created by the reduction in grasses by drought and grazing as
   well as the near elimination of fires. Apparently, severe climatic
   fluctuations of less than 30 years duration combined with grazing do not
   cause lasting changes in the lower treeline of J. deppeana.}},

   be the stable steady state of a simple host-parasite model in which the
   parasite (HIV-1) level is determined by the availability of infectable
   hosts (activated CD4(+) T cells). Such models adequately account for the
   clinical data on the evolution of drug resistant mutants appearing after
   the administration of anti-HIV drugs. The model suggests a novel
   therapeutic approach for AIDS: reducing the CD4 count slightly will
   strongly reduce the HIV load. Combining this anti-CD4 treatment with
   conventional anti-HIV therapy would prevent the outgrowth of drug
   resistant mutants.}},

   spatial characteristics of canopy gaps influence regeneration dynamics,

   Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) was analysed to produce a
   vegetation cover map for a range of types of deciduous woodlands. This
   map was used to delineate canopy gaps in these areas. A raster-based GIS
   was used to derive a range of measures to describe the spatial
   characteristics of canopy gaps, in order to infer the relative
   ecological status of different types of deciduous woodland. For the
   study sites, spatial characteristics have been used to derive
   information on: (1) gap creation mechanisms: large gaps are created by
   progressive enlargement rather than instantaneously by a catastrophic
   event; (2) regeneration dynamics: pioneer invasion and small gaps for
   climax regeneration, plantations have only small gaps; (3) species
   diversity and distribution: semi-natural woodlands have high potential
   genetic variability, high probability of persistence of gap species, and
   a high potential to support `edge' species, the opposite is the case for
   plantations. The combination of airborne remotely sensed data and GIS
   technology holds great potential for ecological studies of woodlands.
   This approach provides a spatial framework on which to base future

Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{1. A simple model is used to investigate the feasibility of eradicating
   bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis Karlson and Lessel) from possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula Kerr) populations by culling, or by distributing
   a (hypothetical) non-transmissible vaccine; and of reducing the
   prevalence of tuberculosis to a defined level within a fixed time
   period.
   2. The model suggests that tuberculosis could be eradicated from a
   possum population by reducing its density to 43\% of the (no-disease)
   carrying capacity, which would require culling possums at a rate of
   9.2\% per year; or by maintaining 40\% of the population in a
   vaccine-immune state, which would require vaccinating possums at a rate
   of 15\% year(-1).
   3. The model suggests that the prevalence of tuberculosis could be
   reduced to 10\% of its pre-control level within 5 years by culling
   possums at a rate of 12\% year(-1), or by vaccinating possums at a rate
   of 13\% year(-1).
   4. Taken together, these results suggest that culling possums to
   maintain a low population density may be the most efficient method of
   preventing tuberculosis from establishing in an uninfected population,
   but vaccination could be as or more efficient as a means of removing
   tuberculosis from an infected population. Both of these statements are
   sensitive to changes in parameter values.
   5. The culling rate needed to achieve eradication of tuberculosis is
   sensitive to the maximum population growth rate, r, and to the logistic
   shape parameter, theta. It is insensitive to whether density-dependent
   population regulation acts through the birth or death rates.
   6. The disease dynamics are sensitive to the shape of the contact rate
   function, which is determined by the relative importance of mating, den
   sharing (possibly sequentially), aerosols and marking, and other
   mechanisms in the transmission of tuberculosis.
   7. All results are sensitive to the increased population mortality due
   to disease, alpha, which is difficult to estimate.
   8. The results have been calculated under the assumption that
   immigration of possums from other areas does not occur. If it did it
   could change the results significantly.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the biological consequences of climate change by
   integrating the results of a tripartite investigation involving
   fumarole, field manipulation and laboratory incubation experiments. The
   geographical region for this research is the maritime Antarctic. Under
   contemporary climate conditions, the lithosols in this region support
   only a sparse cryptogamic flora of limited taxonomic diversity and low
   structural complexity, However, the existence in geothermal areas of
   temperate species (e.g. Campylopus introflexus, Marchantia polymorpha,
   Philonotis acicularis) growing outside their normal biogeographical
   range suggests that elevated temperature and humidity may alter the
   trajectory of community development towards Magellanic or Patagonian
   composition. Productivity is also likely to increase, as indicated by
   significantly greater vegetative biomass recorded beneath
   climate-ameliorating soil covers than in controls. Barren fellfield soil
   samples transplanted to the laboratory and incubated at temperatures of
   2-25 degrees C show rapid development of moss, algae and lichen
   propagules in the range 15-25 degrees C. A variety of species develop
   that have not been recorded in the field. The presence of exotic taxa
   indicates the existence of a dormant propagule bank in maritime
   Antarctic soils and suggests that no significant delay is likely to
   occur between the onset of climate warming and community development:
   instead, rapid establishment of those species favoured by the new
   climate conditions will yield a distinct founder effect, with increasing
   above- and below-ground biomass stimulating biogeochemical cycling. It
   is argued that the combined results of this synthesis identify generic
   responses to climate change arising from the importance at high
   latitudes of low temperature and water availability as limiting factors:
   subject to other growth resources being non-limiting, a more consistent
   stimulatory response to climate change may be expected than in temperate
   or tropical regions. The tripartite approach, encompassing field,
   microcosm and laboratory methodologies, renders the conclusions more
   robust than any single study considered in isolation.}},

Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{461-469}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1 A metapopulation approach considers the ecology and genetics of
   populations as a product of local dynamics and the regional processes of
   migration, extinction and colonization. While conventional
   metapopulation theory involves species with frequent population
   turnover, limited migration and random extinction, it is likely that
   metapopulation dynamics, broadly defined as the product of local
   population dynamics and dispersal, is a feature of all species.
   2 Theoretical metapopulation models of single species make three
   critical insights. First, metapopulations will consist of a shifting
   mosaic of local populations linked through migration with only a
   fraction of the available habitat patches occupied at one time.
   Secondly, there is a threshold number of habitats available, below which
   the species cannot persist because extinction exceeds colonization.
   Thirdly, the antagonism between selective forces acting during
   recolonization and population growth can influence the evolution of
   phenotypic traits. Unfortunately, little empirical data is available to
   evaluate these ideas for plants or to address the broader issue of
   whether processes at a regional scale add anything to our understanding
   of population dynamics.
   3 Plants may seem particularly appropriate for metapopulation analyses
   as a result of their immobility, strong spatial structure and restricted
   dispersal. However, a review of the literature revealed a paucity of
   studies that explicitly adopted a metapopulation approach, particularly
   in terms of testing theoretical models. We argue that this is because of
   the difficulty of measuring parameters such as extinction, colonization
   and migration that are central to most metapopulation models.
   4 Plants possess a number of special features that present both
   challenges and opportunities for the development of new insights into
   the biology of metapopulations. Three particular characteristics, seed
   dormancy, restricted dispersal and local adaptation, need to be
   incorporated into existing theoretical models so they more accurately
   reflect the dynamics of plant metapopulations. Finally, more effort is
   needed to incorporate the explicit spatial structure of individuals
   within metapopulations and to investigate the effect that dispersion has
   on their growth and reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Although the evolution of large-scale dispersal has received
   considerable attention, we know very little about how natural selection
   influences foraging behaviours in herbivorous insects. Host-selection
   behaviours and within-habitat movements jointly determine foraging
   behaviours, since host selection affects the allocation of time spent on
   a particular host versus moving between these hosts. However, host
   selection is generally a labile trait, whose expression is influenced by
   the physiological state of the forager and hence, by characteristics of
   the habitat. We discuss how the quantitative genetic concepts can be
   used to study the evolution of such labile behaviours. Since host
   responses depend on the physiological state of the forager, it is argued
   that the state of the forager must be explicitly considered when
   estimating the additive genetic basis of host-selection behaviours. The
   lability of foraging behaviours increases the difficulty of measuring
   the fitness consequence of variation in the foraging phenotype in
   specific habitats, Therefore, it may be difficult to rely exclusively on
   quantitative genetic methods to test hypotheses about adaptive change in
   foraging behaviours across different habitats. We provide a novel
   approach based on optimality modelling to calculate the fitness
   consequence of variation in the foraging phenotype across different
   habitats. This method, in conjunction with quantitative genetics, can be
   used to test hypotheses concerning the evolution of foraging behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister) in the northeastern
   U.S. have declined recently for unexplained reasons. The species is
   believed to be separate from the more widely distributed eastern woodrat
   (Neotoma floridana; Ord 1818) and is listed as threatened in
   Pennsylvania. Several hypotheses have been proposed for the decline in
   N. magister, but little information on the ecology of the species is
   available to direct conservation efforts. Using a multi-scale approach,
   we compared recent microhabitat and landscape characteristics among
   historical, occupied, and reference sites to pre-1960 versus post-1985
   landscape characteristics associated with historical woodrat sites. Our
   analysis suggests that habitat characteristics, such as percent rock
   cover and aspect, have affected the current distribution of woodrats in
   Pennsylvania. Differences in microhabitat probably do not account for
   the disappearance of woodrats from historical sites. We found no
   evidence that low levels of human activity near nest sites or that
   forest fragmentation were directly responsible for the observed decline.
   But we observed increases in residential and agricultural cover near
   historical sites between 1950s and 1980s and higher percentages of
   croplands and other agricultural cover at historical sites than at
   occupied sites. These land uses are capable of supporting high
   populations of Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) and raccoons
   (Procyon lotor). Increased predation by Great Horned Owls and exposure
   to the raccoon roundworm (Baylisascaris procyonis) have been suggested
   as potential factors contributing to the decline of woodrat populations
   in the northeastern United States. Historical sites had significantly
   higher percentages of coniferous and mixed forest cover than occupied
   sites, and the percentage of coniferous forest cover at historical sites
   increased significantly between 1950s and 1980s. Therefore, we speculate
   that changes in forest composition in Pennsylvania may have adversely
   affected habitat quality (particularly food availability) for Allegheny
   woodrats and contributed to their extirpation from historical sites.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of body size in Anolis lizards of the Lesser Antilles
   Islands has been the subject of intensive, if divisive, study. Early
   research by Schoener revealed a regularity in the number of Anolis
   species that coexisted on islands and the difference in body size
   between coexisting congeners in the Northern Lesser Antilles. This
   consistent pattern of body size was suggested to be the result of
   competitive character displacement. Two recent studies critically
   evaluated this hypothesis by incorporating information about the
   phylogenetic relationships of insular Anolis. Rough-garden and Pacala
   suggested that the patterns of body-size differences in the Northern
   Lesser Antilles could be explained as a cyclical phenomenon that they
   labeled a taxon cycle. However, Loses supported the
   character-displacement hypothesis (''size adjustment''). The conflict
   between these two studies is important because both investigations were
   based on the same phylogenetic hypothesis. We investigated body-size
   evolution in Lesser Antilles Anolis to resolve the differences in the
   conclusions of these studies. Our new analysis supported the taxon-cycle
   hypothesis but nevertheless failed to reject the character-displacement
   hypothesis. We argue that this curious scenario is largely a function of
   the method by which phylogenetic information is incorporated in
   comparative analyses. Different comparative analyses may lead to
   dramatic differences in results and ambiguity in the conclusions to be

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Based on imperfect data and theory, agencies such as the United States
   Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) currently derive `'reference
   doses'' (RfDs) to guide risk managers charged with ensuring that human
   exposures to chemicals are below population thresholds. The RfD for a
   chemical is typically reported as a single number, even though it is
   widely acknowledged that there are significant uncertainties inherent in
   the derivation of this number.
   In this article, the authors propose a probabilistic alternative to the
   EPA's method that expresses the human population threshold as a
   probability distribution of values (rather than a single RfD value),
   taking into account the major sources of scientific uncertainty in such
   estimates. The approach is illustrated using much of the same data that
   USEPA uses to justify their current RfD procedure.
   Like the EPA's approach, our approach recognizes the four key
   extrapolations that are necessary to define the human population
   threshold based on animal data: animal to human, human heterogeneity,
   LOAEL to NOAEL, and subchronic to chronic. Rather than using available
   data to define point estimates of `'uncertainty factors'' for these
   extrapolations, the proposed approach uses available data to define a
   probability distribution of adjustment factors. These initial
   characterizations of uncertainty can then be refined when more robust or
   specific data become available for a particular chemical or class of
   chemicals.
   Quantitative characterization of uncertainty in noncancer risk
   assessment will be useful to risk managers who face complex trade-offs
   between control costs and protection of public health. The new approach
   can help decision-makers understand how much extra control cost must be
   expended to achieve a specified increase in confidence that the human
   population threshold is not being exceeded.}},

Abstract = {{Recent history plays an important role in the physiology, behavior, and
   ecology of individuals, and in the dynamics of populations and
   assemblages of species. In this paper, we examine the impact of history
   on the species composition of intertidal reef corals, by comparing
   simulation models that incorporate four different levels of knowledge
   about the recent past (over a time scale of 1-27 yr). The models are
   Markov or semi-Markov transition probability matrix models, based on
   rates of colonization, persistence, and species replacement measured
   from a long-term study spanning three decades at Heron Island, Great
   Barrier Reef.
   Rates of colonization (transitions from free space) varied 20-fold for
   different species groups, while mortality (transitions to free space)
   ranged fivefold, reflecting a wide range of life histories among the
   coral assemblage. Virtually all species groups could undergo reciprocal
   transitions (e.g., from A to B, and B to A) in a single time interval,
   indicating the lack of a single competitive dominant that was capable of
   outcompeting all or most other species.
   Transition probabilities changed markedly as a function of history. For
   most species groups, the probability of persisting (i.e.,
   `'transitions'' from A to A) increased with time. Thus, a colony that
   had occupied space for some time was generally more likely to continue
   to do so than a new arrival. This result is consistent with an escape in
   size for older colonies from mortality agents such as competition and
   predation. However, three species groups showed the opposite pattern.
   Algae, Pocilloporid corals, and fragile tabular Acroporn showed marked
   increases in transitions to free space after 3-5 yr, reflecting a more
   ephemeral suite of life history traits. Similarly, free space that had
   recently been generated had a higher rate of colonization than
   substratum that had been unoccupied for some time. These results falsify
   a major assumption of standard first-order models, i.e., that transition
   probabilities are constant, and that history is irrelevant.
   Although the changes in transition probabilities as a function of
   history were often striking, the four different models we employed show
   only minor variation in community composition in both transitory and
   climax (equilibrium) phases. Thus, while recent history was important in
   determining transition probabilities, it had little effect on community
   dynamics and structure in this system. This discrepancy is due to the
   rapid turnover of corals and algae on shallow reef crests, where only a
   small proportion of colonies survive long enough to display effects of
   history. All models agreed that the length of time required for this
   system to reach an equilibrium community structure is far longer than
   the observed interval between recurrent disturbances from tropical
   cyclones.}},

   not enough to offset Holocene aridity, and desertscrub replaced

   winters and summers went dry, and continues under the wet winter-summer
   dry regime since 1976. Climate is also modulating the spread of exotic
   annual grasses and introduction of a vigorous fire regime in native
   shrublands, where none existed before. A combination of biogeographic,
   historical, experimental, modeling, and monitoring approaches is
   proposed to predict the ecological outcomes of climate change and direct
   human impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing urbanization of coastal areas is an important concern in the
   Southeastern United States where small, high-salinity, sensitive
   estuaries have been targeted for development over the next two decades.
   This is a particularly acute problem in coastal South Carolina which is
   dependent on tourism and traditional fishing and shellfish harvesting
   activities. Accelerated coastal development and the continued influx of
   people into the coastal zone of South Carolina have increased the
   pressures on the limited coastal resources. These continuing pressures
   threaten the salt marsh estuaries, which are highly vulnerable to
   commercial; industrial, and residential activities in addition to
   physiographic changes brought on by tides, winds and storms. The
   complexity and severity of environmental problems associated with
   coastal growth have been the impetus for many agencies and organizations
   to explore the use of new spatial analytical techniques as a means of
   obtaining timely and valid information which will aid problem solving
   and assist with effective coastal zone management. In response to these
   environmental concerns and the need for better databases and integrated
   spatial models for supporting sustainable coastal development in the
   Southeastern United States, a six-year study of the impacts of
   urbanization on small, high-salinity estuaries was initiated in 1990. An
   overall goal of the Urbanization and Southeastern Estuarine Systems
   (USES) project is utilizing Geographic information Processing (GIP) to
   integrate data and scientific expertise for the identification,
   assessment, and modeling of relationships within coastal estuaries and
   impacts associated with urbanization and natural activities. This goal
   is being achieved through the continued development and utilization of
   the multi-agency Coastal Geographic Information System (C-GIS) and the
   development and validation of spatially explicit models. These models
   can be used to develop and apply a vulnerability index to coastal areas
   that, based on such factors as land use and land cover characteristics,
   receiving waters, and socioeconomic conditions, suggest different
   vulnerabilities to natural and anthropogenic influences.}},

Abstract = {{A new measure of compositional turnover rate at any gradient point is

   instantaneous turnover rates over the gradient span. Both the
   instantaneous rate and total gradient length have been known under the
   name of beta diversity. Our method is elaborated for the Gaussian
   response function. It is compared to Hill's SD measure, much used for
   estimating the gradient length in connection of Detrended Correspondence
   Analysis with non-linear rescaling for axes. The turnover rate along a
   canopy cover gradient in forest vegetation in Finland was used as an
   example. Forest site type and stand age were used as subsidiary
   gradients. The two ways to compute Hill's scaling gave very different
   results and were not comparable with the new method. The turnover rate
   was dependent on the gradient position. However, the turnover rate along
   the gradient of interest and its total length were dependent on the

Abstract = {{Hermit crabs offer unique opportunities in studying the underlying
   motivational mechanisms involved in resource assessment. In particular,
   when assessing shells, the information gathered must influence the
   motivational state and the processes of motivational change may be
   elucidated by experimentation in two main ways. First, by stopping the
   sequence of assessment, either by blocking the shell aperture with
   cement or by sticking the shell, aperture down, to the substrate. This
   enables the duration for which the crab persists in assessing the shell
   to be measured. Second, by presenting a novel, potentially startling,
   stimulus at some point in the assessment and measuring the duration of
   the startle response. With the first method persistence time should show
   a positive correlation with motivation to acquire the new shell,
   whereas, with the second method, the duration of the startle response
   should be negatively correlated with that motivational state. Because
   the motvational state must reflect the information the crab has at any
   moment, these two methods provide independent ways of probing the
   acquisition of information. The fact that shell assessment is easily
   observed and quantified in the laboratory and that the resource (shell)
   may be experimentally modified in numerous ways, makes these crabs the
   ideal subjects with which to develop a general model of resource
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{1. Three major determinants of bees' nectar-foraging patterns are the
   maximum depth at which nectar is accessible (dependent on bee tongue
   length); the minimum profitable energy content per flower (dependent on
   foraging costs and hence on bee body mass); and the minimum threshold
   temperature for flight. These form the axes of a three-dimensional
   template, the competition box.
   2. Thresholds of depth, cost and temperature can be identified for each
   species of bee, delimiting domains within the box compatible with
   foraging by each bee species.
   3. Changes through a day in temperature and in the depth and sugar
   content of nectar define the nectar trajectory through the box for a
   flower species in relation to microclimate and bee activity.
   4. This approach allows systematic appraisal of the roles of
   accessibility, energy content and temperature in interspecific
   competition among bees for nectar, and draws attention to situations in
   which additional factors may be important.
   5. By superimposing a bee-species-specific template on a representative
   nectar trajectory for a given flower species in a given situation, it is
   possible to make reasoned guesses about the expected interactions of
   foraging bee species with a novel flower species and with each other in
   a novel situation. Such guesses are required for evaluating the expected
   impact of honey-bees and other introduced pollinators on the pollination
   system of crops and natural vegetation.
   6. Use of the competition box is illustrated in relation to dawn-to-dusk
   studies involving measurements of nectar concentration and volume,
   microclimate, flower form, and the tongue lengths and foraging activity

Abstract = {{Soil water use by shrubs and grasses of vegetation patches (vegetation
   arcs) occurring in two-phase mosaics of the Southern Chihuahuan Desert
   (Mexico) was investigated after an experimental irrigation equivalent to
   a 75 mm rainfall. Three shrubs (Flourensia cernua, Larrea tridentata and
   Prosopis glandulosa) and one grass (Hilaria mutica) were studied.
   Irrigation water did not percolate deeper than 40 cm. This soil layer
   contained more than 75\% of the roots in all species, except P.
   glandulosa where a less developed, deeper root system was detected (but
   nor quantified).
   Root distribution indicates that the water stored in the 0-40-cm soil
   layer after the experimental irrigation was available for the four
   species. However, predawn xylem water potential (XWP) of F. cernua and
   H. mutica were strongly influenced by soil water present in the 0-40-cm
   layer, whereas those of L. tridentata and P. glandulosa were not.
   Differences in predawn XWP between watered and unwatered individuals
   were greatest in F. cernua and H. mutica, and smallest in P. glandulosa.
   Changes in tissue osmotic potential (TOP) values as a consequence of
   watering were sharply marked in all species except P. glandulosa. H.
   mutica XWP approached zero for a few days in response to small rain
   events.
   The results indicate that adult individuals of grasses and shrubs are
   potential competitors for soil resources (to a variable degree according
   to the shrub species). Their co-existence in the arcs is probably
   favoured by a process of slow competitive displacement as long as the
   recruitment of new shrubs takes place mainly by colonization of the
   upslope fringe of the arcs where grass biomass is low. As development of
   the vegetation progresses in the colonization front and the grass canopy
   is almost closed, the chances of a shrub being suppressed by water
   competition diminishes in the following order: F. cernua, L. tridentata,
   P. glandulosa. A drastic reduction in grass biomass because of grazing
   would depress the competitive ability of the grasses and may
   preferentially facilitate the establishment of livestock dispersed
   species like P. glandulosa. A consequent shift to a more shrubby
   community seems unavoidable since the recovery of the grass strata will
   probably not suppress the newly-established shrubs tapping water from
   deep water sources. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited.}},

Abstract = {{Plant invasions ave a serious threat to natural and managed ecosystems
   worldwide. The number of species involved and tbe extent of existing
   invasions renders the problem virtually intractable, and it is likely to
   worsen as mol-e species are introduced to new habitats and more existing
   invaders move into a phase of rapid spread We contend that current
   research and management approaches are inadequate to tackle the problem.
   The current focus is mostly on the characteristics and control of
   individual invading species. Much can be gained however, by considering
   other important components of the invasion problem. Patterns of weed
   spread indicate that many species have a long lag phase following
   introduction before they spread explosively. Early detection and
   treatment of invasions before explosive spread occurs will prevent many
   future problems. Similarly a focus on the invaded ecosystem and its
   management, rather than on the invader is likely to be more effective
   identification of the causal factors enhancing ecosystem invasibility
   should lend to more-effective integrated control programs. An assessment
   of the value of particular sites and their degree of disturbance would
   allow the setting of management priorities for protection and control.
   Socioeconomic factors frequently play a large part than ecological
   factors in plant invasions. Changes in human activities in terms of
   plant introduction and use, land use, and timing of control measures are
   all required before the plant invasion problem can be tackled adequately
   Dealing with plant invasions is nn urgent; task that will require
   difficult decisions about land use and management priorities. These
   decisions have to be made if we want to conserve biodiversity worldwide.}},

Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Succession was studied in a cold-temperate forest in the Boundary Waters
   Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) of northeastern Minnesota. The 13 x 18 km
   study area comprises a complex forest mixture of jack (Pinus banksiana)
   and other pines, quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides): paper birch
   (Betula papyrifera), black spruce (Picea mariana), balsam fir (Abies
   balsamea), and white cedar (Thuja occidentalis) on thin soils over the
   Canadian Shield bedrock. The main objectives of this study were to
   examine the relationships between spatial patchiness, spatial scale, and
   canopy succession in the southern-boreal forest of the BWCAW, and to
   evaluate under what conditions successional direction may remain stable,
   converge, or diverge. Knowledge of the successional direction of old
   forests in the BWCAW that are undergoing demographic transition from
   even-aged to uneven-aged is important because the landscape now has many
   old stands as a result of reduced fire frequency. Rotation periods for
   fires have changed from approximate to 50-100 yr in presettlement times
   to >1000 yr since 1910.
   Analyses were conducted at spatial scales ranging from the individual
   tree (0.01 ha) to the large stand (16 ha). Two permanent mapped plots
   (of area 0.53 and 0.56 ha) were established in stands of different age.
   Fine-scale age structure successional change, transition from one
   species to another, and development of small scale age structure,
   succesional change, transition from one species to another, and
   development of small patches (of area <0.25 ha) were studied by means of
   stand history reconstruction with increment cores, spatial
   autocorrelation, and analysis of replacement trees in canopy openings.
   Spatial processes at nested scales of 1, 4, and 16 ha were examined on
   15 square 16-ha tracts of upland forest, which are distributed among
   forests ranging from 15 to 190 yr old. Canopy species composition and
   patch development over lime on these 15 tracts were interpreted on air
   photos taken in 1934, 1961, and 1991. Thus, the study includes a
   chronosequence approach, with verification of chronosequence validity by
   checking patch development processes at more than one time point. This
   checking was done at small spatial scales by reconstruction of stand
   history on permanent mapped plots, and at larger spatial scales with
   sequential air photos of the same locations spanning a 57-year period.
   Results show that the reduced fire frequency in recent years has changed
   the dominant successional pathways. When fire frequency was high, jack
   pine or aspen stands usually burned while still in the even-aged stage
   of development, and the new trees after the burn were the same species
   as before. Currently, many stands are undergoing demographic transition
   from even-aged stands of catastrophic fire origin to uneven-aged stands.
   This transition parallels a change in canopy composition from jack pine
   (occasionally red pine (Pinus resinosa)) or aspen to an old-growth
   multi-aged mixture of black spruce, balsam fir, paper birch, and white
   cedar. The mechanism that moves this successional path forward is canopy
   openings, 10-30 m across on average: caused by wind, insect, and
   disease, that gradually chip away at the relatively uniform canopy of
   pines and aspen. Successional direction is individualistic in the sense
   that time and rate of transition from pine/aspen to other species
   depends on the action of heavy windstorms, insect infestation, and
   senescence of old pines that create canopy openings, Canopy openings are
   often filled with one of several species, but if more than one species
   invades an opening, monodominant patches of each species generally
   result. Understory-overstory interactions are very weak; the dominant
   species within each patch is apparently independent: of the overstory
   species that died when the opening was created or the species dominating
   surrounding patches. During succession, the spatial structure of the
   stands at the 1-16 ha scales generally changes from a matrix heavily
   dominated by pine or aspen to a mosaic with relatively large
   mono-dominant patches that may be remnants of the extensive original
   matrix, and finally to a mixture with small patches (mean area 35 m(2),
   maximum approximate to 0.1 ha) of black spruce, balsam fir, white cedar,
   and paper birch. Thus, at 1-16 ha spatial scales, succession leads to
   convergence on a mixture of species. At smaller spatial scales (e.g.,
   0.01-0.1 ha) successional pathways appear to diverge into four community
   types. The same successional pathways can be reconstructed from
   historical analysis of individual stands as from a chronosequence of
   stands; therefore, chronosequences in this area have been stable at
   least during the lifetime of the current generation of trees.}},

Abstract = {{The area under agricultural production in southern Africa is declining
   as a result of industrial expansion, mining as well as formal and
   informal urbanization. Simultaneously, the increasing demand for timber
   products will necessitate a doubling of the present area under
   commercial afforestation in South Africa over the next 30 years.
   Potentially afforestable areas, however, frequently occur in the same
   climatic belts as certain subtropical fruit crops. Given the climatic
   constraints for optimum growth of commercially afforestable timber
   species and subtropical horticultural crops, that southern Africa is a
   largely semi-arid region, the fact that the areal extent of land
   available for agriculture is shrinking, together with the uncertainties
   and possible threats linked with anticipated global climate change, the
   identification of land areas suitable for future expansion of
   plantations and subtropical crops requires careful assessment.
   The spatial distributions of areas suited climatically to optimum growth
   of two commercial tree species, Eucalyptus grandis and Pinus patula, and
   two subtropical crops, avocado and pecan nut, were mapped for southern
   Africa using a climate threshold approach in conjunction with detailed
   gridded climate information bases, for both the present climate and for
   a possible future climate scenario. Results indicate that the possible
   impacts of a future temperature-increase on the spatial distributions of
   optimum growth areas is species dependent, favouring E. grandis, avocado
   and pecan nut, but not P. patula. According to the climatic threshold
   model used, the timber species and horticultural crops considered
   produced a westward shift to `new' climatically suitable areas in the
   future. The results also indicate that climate change resulting from the
   augmented greenhouse effect may benefit the horticultural industry to a
   greater extent than the timber industry. Hence, competition for land
   suitable for future expansion of certain commercial tree species and
   subtropical crops may become an important consideration in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Technological change in the UK herring industry took place rapidly after
   1965, due in part to the active encouragement given to fishermen to
   switch from drift-netting to pelagic trawling and purse-seining. The
   adoption and diffusion of these modern methods of capture stimulated a
   major expansion of output, but this very success was undermined by the
   depletion of the fish-stocks on which the industry depended, In the case
   of the West of Scotland herring fisheries, which were especially
   important to UK fishermen, the decline in fish-stock biomass caused
   vessel catch-rates to fall after 1973. The failure of international
   fisheries management, which acted as a permissive factor in the
   intensification of fishing effort, also had important economic
   implications as it resulted in the dissipation of resource-rent. The
   Authors calculate that the maximum sustainable `rent' which could have
   been generated from the West of Scotland herring fishery was
   approximately \$14 millions per annum at 1976-equivalent prices.
   The resource-rent effectively financed the overcapitalization of the
   fleet and the decline which followed, and it is the speed with which
   this occurred that most distinguishes the herring fishery from others
   where technological change has taken place. The article concludes by
   arguing that, although the UK public authorities (notably the Herring
   Industry Board) might reasonably be criticized for pursuing a
   development strategy which resulted in economic and biological

Abstract = {{Two major issues are discussed in this paper. The first is the
   commitment of Federal and State Governments to the maintenance of
   biodiversity and nature conservation through their endorsement of
   conservation strategies. Based on a rangeland biophysical resource
   inventory survey (Pringle et at, 1994) it is contended that existing
   nature conservation reserves are not representative of the biological
   diversity in the region. In 1990, less than 1\% of the survey area was
   under nature reservation. Whilst 13 of 17 land types are present in
   reserves, most of the reserves consist of land types lease suitable for
   pastoralism (but not necessarily lacking conservation value). The land
   types most subject to preferential grazing and most threatened from a
   nature conservation perspective are poorly (three types) or not (four
   types) represented, and certainly not replicated, in nature reserves of
   the survey area, which exceeds 100 000 km(2). Of the 23 priority plant
   species for nature conservation occurring in the survey area, 21 are not
   known to occur in nature reserves. Nature conservation in the area needs
   to improve because of the unrepresentativeness of the existing nature
   reserves and the absence of numerous priority plant species for nature
   conservation from these areas. We should recognize that reservation is
   but one nature conservation strategy. Viewed as a land tenure issue,
   this paper presents a case for a more representative nature reserve
   system, and substantial changes in outlook towards off-reserve nature
   conservation. First, an integrated appraisal of findings from rangeland
   and biological surveys is required. Together they provide a strong
   foundation for nature conservation planning, from which a more
   representative nature reserve system can be planned. Given that
   off-reserve nature conservation values are still likely to be
   substantial, partly as a result of compromise with existing land uses,
   new approaches to land management, sensitive to these values, may be
   required.
   The second major issue concerns the success of maintaining regional
   biological diversity in the arid shrubland rangelands of Western
   Australia, which will be strongly influenced by the use of the
   semi-natural matrix of lands under pastoral management. In six suggested
   opportunities, this paper addresses how this use may be achieved.
   Central to the ideas is a regional approach in which all stakeholders
   can contribute to, and have ownership of, regional environmental
   management plans. This paper emphasizes the role that conservative
   pastoral management might be able to play and some approaches to
   encourage more widespread participation of pastoralists in nature
   conservation management.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of ecological morphology of woody plants is based both on
   the exact description of single structural elements and architecture.
   These must be described under optimal environmental conditions (ideal
   phenotype) as well as on variations in the ideal phenotype induced by
   changes in the environment (modifications). The latter result in
   degeneration and subsequently deviation from the ideal type. Through
   regeneration and reiteration trees can grow back to a form approaching
   the ideal type. A whole plant approach is followed in which morphology
   dependent on ontogeny and the environment (genetic-environment
   interaction) is presented.
   Morphological and anatomical investigations on the trunk, crown and
   needles were carried out on 100-130 year old fir trees from Yugoslavia
   (Pokljuka) and the Black Forest as well as on young firs. The most
   important results are as follows: In fir the terminal bud has a simple
   anatomy (bud category 1) with a developmental cycle of a single period.
   In lateral buds, regularly sprouting buds and suppressed buds
   (proventitious buds), can be distinguished both morphologically and
   phenologically.
   For spruce the morphogenetic cycle of the regular bud can be divided
   into three phases; the growth phase I (bud scale formation), growth
   phase II (formation of needle primordia) and the dormant phase
   (overwintering of the buds). The shoot and needle development from
   regularly developed buds can be distinguished on the basis of the
   phyllochrone (dormancy period) between the premature (proleptic), the
   normal (regular) and retarded (proventitious) differentiation. In young
   fir trees the regular shoot development predominates, whereas in older
   trees the proventitious shoot development is most common.
   The regular annual shoot of fir can be divided into a stunted and
   elongated shoot part. The elongated part can be subdivided into a distal
   regularly sprouting bud area and a proximal area of suppressed buds. The
   branch development of the annual shoots is acrotonous, the growth is
   monopodial (distally oriented shoot development).
   The subsequent shoot development results from proventitious buds on the
   stems as well as from buds in the primary crown. Due to this the twigs
   and branches can be put back on the dormant axes (proximally oriented
   shoot development). The proventitious branches in the primary crown are
   formed from proventitious buds mainly in first and second order axes and
   epitonously. Using the proventitious branches on the trunk firs can
   develop a completely new and `'basally transferable'' (towards the
   roots) crown (proventitious secondary crown). This can be formed as
   light-adapted or as shade-adapted crown.
   The proventitious shoots serve as substitutes for insufficient crown
   parts, the regeneration of the crown, the adaptation of the crown to
   develop an optimal form for the given environmental conditions and also
   to exploit the light in favourable growth phases.
   The flowers and inflorescences are formed as preformed structural
   elements. The male flowers are developed medially and hypotonously on
   the shoots of higher order. The female inflorescences are developed
   medially and epitonously on axes of first and second order.
   In young firs the angle at which the axes of first order grow is on
   average 67 degrees. The needle form and in particular the needle tip,
   changes in dependence upon the shoot order (topophylly).
   The anatomy of the abscission zone of fir needles is described. The fir
   needle sits directly on the cork layer, which is a single period active
   bark periderm of the shoot axis in this area. In contrast to spruce,
   needle fall does not follow the rhexolytic shrinking mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{A new method that allows controlled masking of luminance contrast has
   been developed to study the use of chromatic signals in human vision.
   The method also makes it possible to examine the different uses of
   chromatic signals (e.g. the generation of perceived colour, or the
   construction and representation of object structure and form). By using
   this technique, we studied the threshold detection of chromatic signals
   in normal trichromats. The results show that chromatic signals are
   virtually unaffected by ongoing, randomly varying, luminance contrast
   changes. These findings suggest that chromatic signals are either
   processed independently or can be separated completely from any
   confounding luminance contrast components in the stimulus. Thresholds
   for detection of colour changes only, and for extraction of stimulus
   structure from chromatic signals in normal trichromats, in subjects with
   single cone receptor deficiency (i.e. dichromats) and in three subjects
   with abnormal colour vision caused by bilateral damage to ventromedial,
   extra-striate visual cortex (i.e. subjects with cerebral achromatopsia)
   have also been measured. No significant difference in thresholds for the
   two conditions was observed either in normal trichromats or in
   dichromats. Subjects with cerebral achromatopsia, however, reveal
   markedly different thresholds. The results suggest that chromatic
   signals are processed independently to generate perceived object colour
   or to construct spatially structured objects, and that these functions
   involve different neural substrates. The results help to explain, at
   least in part, why cerebral achromatopsia is a het and why there can be
   significant differences in the effective use of chromatic signals in
   subjects described as cerebral achromatopsics.}},

Abstract = {{Modelling ill-defined systems requires powerful tools to attain a
   quantitatively description of the studied systems. In this paper, a
   modelling concept is presented that tackles the problems inherent to
   processes for which the necessary a priori knowledge for deductive
   analysis is lacking. The approach can be summarised as follows. By means
   of relationship detectors, such as SAPS or fractional factorials, the
   existence of a causal structure can be deduced qualitatively. In a next
   step of the modelling task, the goal is to find the quantitative
   description of this relationship. This step can be subdivided in two
   phases, i.e. model structure characterisation and finally parameter
   estimation. In this paper new techniques are proposed (and validated on
   real-life experimental results) to achieve the latter steps, In order to
   separate the structure characterisation from the parameter estimation
   task, an approach is taken in which parameter-invariant features are
   extracted from the data. The properties of these features are chosen in
   such a way that a classifier can select a specific model description.
   The decomposition in Zernike features and the recurrent neural network
   classifier, introduced by Sudharsanan, constitute the implementation of
   this concept. To check the feasibility of this modelling approach, a
   biotechnological application is chosen as a test case. Due to the
   changing nature of the wastewater treatment process, reflected in a set
   of mathematical descriptions applicable at different time instances, the
   aforementioned methodology will give the possibility to develop more
   efficient adaptive controllers.}},

Abstract = {{The intense demand for river water in arid regions is resulting in
   widespread changes in riparian vegetation. We present a direct gradient
   method to predict the vegetation change resulting from a proposed
   upstream dam or diversion. Our method begins with the definition of
   vegetative cover types, based on a census of the existing vegetation in
   a set of 1 x 2 m plots. A hydraulic model determines the discharge
   necessary to inundate each plot. We use the hydrologic record, as
   defined by a flow duration curve, to determine the inundation duration
   for each plot. This allows us to position cover types along a gradient
   of inundation duration. A change in river management results in a new
   flow duration curve, which is used to redistribute the cover types among
   the plots. Changes in vegetation are expressed in terms of the area
   occupied by each cover type.
   We applied this approach to riparian vegetation of the Black Canyon of
   the Gunnison National Monument along the Gunnison River in Colorado. We
   used TWINSPAN to cluster plots according to species occurrence. This
   analysis defined three vegetative cover types that were distinct in
   terms of inundation duration. Quantitative changes in the extent of
   cover types were estimated for three hypothetical flow regimes: two
   diversion alternatives with different minimum flows and a moving average
   modification of historical flows. Our results suggest that (1) it is
   possible to cause substantial changes in riparian vegetation without
   changing mean annual flow, and (2) riparian vegetation is especially
   sensitive to changes in minimum and maximum flows.
   Principal advantages of this method are simplicity and reliance on
   relatively standard elements of plant community ecology and hydrologic
   engineering. Limitations include use of a single environmental gradient,
   restrictive assumptions about changes in channel geometry,
   representation of vegetation as quasi-equilibrium cover types, and the
   need for model validation.}},

Abstract = {{Biomanipulation and diversion of nutrients can affect not only the
   eutrophication level, but also the trophic structure and species
   composition of the phytoplankton society in lakes. Existing models often
   fail to describe the reactions of the ecosystem when such qualitative
   changes are involved. For this purpose structural dynamic models are
   needed. This paper presents the first attempt to model the qualitative
   changes that have been observed to occur in a Danish shallow lake as a
   result of biomanipulation. A structural dynamic model was developed that
   included nine species or types of algae normally observed in Danish
   shallow lakes. The high flow ratio of the lake was assumed to justify
   that summer conditions would represent a steady state of the system. The
   parameters of the model were calibrated until the model gave adequate
   results. The available mathematical tools normally used for calibration
   were found to give unsatisfactory results. The calibration therefore had
   to be carried out by running the model repetitively, adjusting
   parameters until it was able to perform according to the changes
   actually observed in the lake chosen for this case study. The use of
   parameters from literature to characterize the different types of algae
   is shown to have a great impact on this phase of model development. The
   calibration was found to be very time consuming, mainly due to
   uncertainties connected to the input parameters. The importance and
   uncertainty of the parameters chosen indicate that we may probably have
   to choose new strategies for similar modelling approaches in the future,
   such as the application of goal functions. The implementations would
   allow parameters to vary during simulations in order to simulate
   ecosystem properties, such as adaptational processes and buffering
   capacities which are features possessed by natural ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{We characterized the structure of 25 old-growth hemlock-hardwood forests
   in northern Wisconsin and adjacent Michigan in order to examine our
   working hypotheses that differences in their structure are related to
   stand age (i.e., stage of development) and that changes in stand
   structure continue after old-growth status is achieved. Estimates of
   stand age, i.e., age of oldest tree cored, based on 10 cores taken from
   hemlocks of a range of diameters in each stand, ranged from 177 to 374.
   By investigating the patterns of live tree structure, coarse woody
   debris (CWD), tip-up mounds, and canopy gaps in relation to stand age,
   we were able to infer changes that occur during stand development.
   Along the gradient of old-growth stand development, some changes in
   structural features, including total volume of CWD, snag (standing dead
   tree) basal area, and total area and average size of canopy gaps were
   continuous, linear increases over time. In contrast, changes in live
   tree and snag density, density of large trees, volume of well-decayed
   hemlock logs, and diameter-age relationships occurred after a threshold
   stand age of 275-300 yr was reached. Area and density of tip-up mounds
   and density of large seedlings and saplings were not correlated with
   stand age.
   Old-growth hemlock-hardwood stands at the upper end of the age continuum
   (> 275-300 yr) have accumulated both gradual and threshold structural
   changes, acquiring most of the following characteristics: (1) a strong
   correlation between age and diameter of trees, (2) low densities of live
   trees distributed across all size classes, (3) trees >70 cm dbh
   (diameter at breast height), (4) dead wood >120-150 m(3)/ha, with logs
   >80 m(3)/ha, (5) hemlock logs present in all decay classes, and (6)
   canopy gaps occupying >10\% of the stand, with the average gap size > 50
   m(2), some gaps > 200 m(2), and no more than 30\% of the gaps <10 m(2).
   The two oldest stands may be at or near equilibrium, where maximum
   volumes of CWD are maintained through a balance of tree growth and
   mortality, and wood decay; and oldest tree age approaches 400+ yr, the
   maximum longevity typical for hemlock.}},

Abstract = {{Since the mid-1980s, cyanide in heap leach solutions and mill tailings
   ponds at gold mines in Nevada has killed a large but incompletely

   birds). This field investigation documents the availability of cyanide
   at a variety of `typical' Nevada gold mines during 1990 and 1991,
   describes wildlife reactions to cyanide solutions, and discusses
   procedures for eliminating wildlife loss from cyanide poisoning.
   Substantial progress has been made to reduce wildlife loss. About half
   of the mill tailings ponds (some up to 150 ha) in Nevada have been
   chemically treated to reduce cyanide concentrations (the number needing
   treatment is uncertain) and many of the smaller heap leach solution
   ponds and channels are now covered with netting to exclude birds and
   most mammals. The discovery of a cyanide gradient in mill tailings ponds
   (concentration usually 2-3 times higher at the inflow point than at
   reclaim point) provides new insight into wildlife responses (mortality)
   observed in different portions of the ponds, Finding dead birds on the
   tops of ore heaps and associated with solution puddling is a new
   problem, but management procedures for eliminating this source of
   mortality are available. A safe threshold concentration of cyanide to
   eliminate wildlife loss could not be determined from the field data and
   initial laboratory studies. New analytical methods may be required to
   assess further the wildlife hazard of cyanide in mining solutions.}},

   1864, and/or Dechenellinae Pribyl, 1946. These are Crassiproetus Stumm,
   1953a, Basidechenella Richter, 1912, Dechenella Kayser, 1880, and
   Monodechenella Stumm, 1953a, which were originally considered to be
   closely related. A higher-level phylogenetic analysis of the Proetinae
   is conducted to see if these taxa were indeed closely related and thus
   represent a single endemic radiation of species in Eastern North America
   or rather a series of independent lineages in that region. In the course
   of discerning characters that defined the Proetinae, it was discovered
   that Monodechenella lacks several of the characters that define the
   Proetinae, and the members of this genus therefore must be excluded from
   this subfamily. They instead appear to belong to a larger group
   informally referred to as the `'Thebanaspis clade,'' which appears to be
   closely related to the Proetinae. A phylogenetic analysis is performed
   on proetine ingroup taxa using 21 taxa and 53 characters, and several of
   the major generic clades in the Proetinae are considered.
   The phylogenetic analysis of the Proetinae is used to ascertain the
   ancestral biogeographic states for the three genera in the Proetinae
   that form an important component of the Lower and Middle Devonian
   trilobite fauna of Eastern North America. This information is used to
   determine if these taxa are ancestrally present in Eastern North America
   or rather represent a series of invasions from other biogeographic
   regions. Other taxa occurring in Eastern North America at this time
   appear to represent elements that invaded from Armorica. This invasion
   of taxa has been related to the collision between plates that produced
   the Acadian Orogeny during the Middle Devonian. Patterns in these
   proetid taxa are compared with those known for other groups to ascertain
   what control the Acadian Orogeny as a biogeographic event may have had
   on the appearance of these taxa in Eastern North America.
   Phylogenetic analysis is then performed on all available species in each
   of these generic clades that occur in Eastern North America. Species
   that belong to these clades but which hail from other biogeographic
   regions are also considered. These phylogenies were used to assess
   macroevolutionary patterns such as diversification and extinction within
   each of these clades in Eastern North America. In addition to being an
   important paleogeographic event, the Acadian Orogeny also caused major
   paleoenvironmental changes. The impact of these changes on the proetid
   fauna of Eastern North America is assessed. It appears that a phenomenon
   analogous to Vrba's (1985, 1992) Turnover Pulse Hypothesis may have
   mediated elevated speciation rates in the proetid taxa over the period
   considered. However, eventually the profound changes in environment
   appear to have led to the extinction of much of the proetid trilobite
   fauna of Eastern North America.
   Information on patterns of occurrence in different geographic regions is
   combined with information from the phylogenetic analyses of the
   individual generic clades to consider large-scale biogeographic patterns
   in the late Lower and Middle Devonian. A method for considering
   biogeographic patterns using cladistic information is developed. This
   method is based on Brooks Parsimony Analysis, but it allows multiple
   events of range expansion and subsequent vicariant splitting to occur
   within each generic clade. This biogeographic method was used to
   evaluate the relationships between the Arctic, Armorican, and Eastern
   North American paleobiogeographic regions. The relationships between the
   different major sedimentary basins in Eastern North America, the
   Appalachian, Illinois, and Michigan basins, are also considered.
   Finally, the origin of major evolutionary faunas in the fossil record is
   discussed. Included is a brief discussion of a depauperate proetid fauna
   of the Emsian and Eifelian whose members do not belong to the four
   generic clades considered in detail.
   In this work four new genera are recognized: Plesiowensus,
   Arcticormistonia, Aayemenaytcheia, and Milesdavis. In addition, 12 new
   species are described: Arcticormistonia edgecombei, Crassiproetus
   halliturgidus, C. neoturgidus, C. stummi, C. schohariensis,

   carvalhoae, Pedinodechenella modelli, Milesdavis eldredgei, and
   Monodechenella legrandsmithi. Diagnoses and discussions for all of the
   taxa considered are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The economic injury level (EIL) concept is the basis for decisions in
   most integrated pest management (IPM) programs. These IPM programs are
   fundamentally different from control approaches to handling pest
   problems by focusing on tolerating pest effects. The EIL is essential
   for IPM programs because it indicates which levels of pests can be
   tolerated and which cannot. By increasing our ability to tolerate pests,
   it is possible to eliminate or reduce the need for management tactics.
   Moreover, we can improve and maintain environmental quality through
   better decisions on the use of those tactics. EILs help maintain
   environmental quality by reducing unnecessary use of management tactics,
   especially of pesticides. However, including environmental
   considerations explicitly in the decision-making process could greatly
   improve the ability of IPM to sustain environmental quality. To
   understand the current and potential roles of EILs in maintaining
   environmental quality, it is first necessary to examine the components
   of the EIL. These include economic damage, economic thresholds, and the
   EIL itself. Of these elements, the economic threshold has been the most
   problematic because it depends on predictions of pest population growth
   rates. Most approaches to economic threshold development can be grouped
   into subjective and objective categories, with the objective category
   being based on calculated EILs. Increased availability of calculated
   EILs and their related economic thresholds would reduce unnecessary use
   of management tactics. Additional attention to the EIL itself could
   further improve the responsiveness of IPM programs to environmental
   concerns. In particular, by including direct considerations of
   environmental factors, as well as economic and biological information,
   into EILs, it would be possible to develop environmental EILs. An
   environmental EIL evaluates a management tactic based not only on its
   direct costs and benefits to the user but also on its effects on the
   environment. Activities to support greater environmental responsiveness
   in the EIL include accounting for environmental costs in the C variable,
   reducing damage per injury by increasing plant tolerance in the D
   variable, and developing an effective, yet environmentally responsible,
   K variable by reducing pesticide application rates. Focusing research
   efforts on these aspects of the EIL concept offers the prospect of
   improved responsiveness to environmental concerns in IPM, without a
   reliance on new tactics.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological phenomena are evident over a broad spectrum of space and time
   scales. Ecotones, being defined as zones of transition between adjacent
   ecological systems, also must occur over an equally broad spectrum of
   space and time scales. Scale-dependent constraints influence ecological
   phenomena and resulting zones of transition; however, in traditional
   ecotone studies little treatment has been given to these influences.
   This paper addresses aspects of the ecotone concept that relate to the
   strength of interactions between adjacent systems for a hierarchy of
   ecotones in a biome transition area in central New Mexico on the
   Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. Zones of transition occur at plant,
   population, patch, landscape, and biome levels in the hierarchy
   suggested here. Constraints differ across this hierarchy, primarily
   because of the different scales at which these constraints exert their
   influences. The basic strategy to understand these cross-scale
   influences must be to perform studies at different scales, and a
   hierarchical approach identifies those scales. This also is important
   for identifying the appropriate technologies that focus at the scales
   where transition zones between ecological systems/phenomena are
   expressed. A broad array of technologies are available for integrating
   the pattern-process relationships that occur across the many scales in

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of the ecological impacts of climatic change is a
   pressing challenge to the science of ecology. The current state of the
   art for broad-scale estimates of change in biomes and ecotones between
   biomes is limited to equilibrium estimates of ecological change under
   some future equilibrium climate. Uncertainties in these estimates
   abound, ranging from uncertainties in future climate scenarios to
   uncertainties in our ecological models and finally to uncertainties in
   modelling the feedbacks between the climate and the biosphere.
   Ecologists and policymakers need to go beyond equilibrium estimates of
   biosphere change to transient responses of the biosphere as the climate
   changes. Ecotones between biomes have been suggested as sensitive areas
   of change that could be effectively modelled and monitored for future
   change. Ecotones are also important in influencing local and regional
   biodiversity patterns and ecological flows. The ecological processes
   that could affect change at ecotones and within biomes are discussed;
   they include internal ecosystem processes, such as competition, and
   external abiotic processes, most notably drought and related
   disturbances. Drought followed by infestations and fire appears to be
   the most likely process that could mediate ecological change under a
   rapidly changing climate. The impacts would be apparent all across
   biomes, not just at ecotones. However, specific predictions about the
   dynamics of ecotones can be made qualitatively, based on a theory of
   patch scaling and diversity in relation to abiotic stressors. Under
   current conditions, the size of homogeneous patches is expected to be
   small at ecotones, but to enlarge with distance from the ecotone.
   Directional climatic change should promote a coalescence of patches on
   one side of the ecotone and increased fragmentation on the other side.
   Ecotones should begin to blur as viewed from a satellite only to re-form
   at some later date in a new location. This view is in contrast to the
   notion that ecotones would retain sharp distinction and simply move
   across the landscape. These changes are presented as hypotheses based on
   theory and should be testable in a mechanistic modeling framework that
   is only now being developed.}},

Abstract = {{Climatic variations over the two last centuries are well known for the
   northern hemisphere, but very little information is available for
   subantarctic islands. In this paper, we combined geomorphological
   observations and a new biological dating technique to propose a
   reconstruction of the cool and warm events in the Kerguelen Islands
   during the last two centuries. The usual dating methods, such as
   dendrochonology or C-14 dating, are not applicable on Kerguelen.
   Therefore, the radial growth of Azorella selago Hook., a cushion-forming
   Umbelliferae species, was used to estimate the absolute age of
   deglaciated areas. Glacial margins in the vicinity of the Glacier Ampere
   constitute the most complete chronosequence studied in this part of the
   world and illustrate seven warming-cooling cycles. This new dating
   technique is validated by the close relationship between the calculated
   ages of these climatic events and the results of several studies in
   other circumantarctic regions. The Glacier Ampere reached its maximum
   extent at the end of the eighteenth century. Since 1799, two discrete
   phases may be distinguished: the first period (1799-1965) is
   characterized by small glacier fluctuations (1 km retreat overall)
   whereas in the second period (1966 to the present), the retreat is much
   more rapid (about 3 km). It seems that the current dramatic glacial
   retreat on Kerguelen is related to a major change in the climate and
   could illustrate a more general southern hemispheric pattern of glacial
   fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{The appreciation by earlier workers of the importance of studying avian
   cooperative breeding (CB) in an explicitly phylogenetic context has

   conceptual methods correct for correlations among species inherent in
   their phylogenetic relationships and are used to study the evolution and
   adaptive status of CB in the context of phylogenetic trees. Statistical,
   simulation, and phylogenetic analyses of the taxonomic distribution of
   CB among passerine genera confirm the suspicion that CB is nonrandomly
   distributed among genera and extend the conclusion of E. Russell that CB
   may be ancient in some lineages, many of which include well-studied
   species. Phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral states of ecological
   factors hypothesized to have promoted CB revealed a variety of temporal
   relationships between the inferred invasion of selective environments
   and the origin of CB that were not immediately apparent from
   nonphylogenetic analyses and that clarified the mechanistic relationship

   substantial change in the selective environments presumed responsible

   explain the observed plasticity and context-specific variation in many

   STREAM-MANAGEMENT DECISIONS - ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC-ASPECTS}},

Abstract = {{1. Stream-management decisions must produce an optimal cost-effect
   ratio, as related to social, ecological and economic concerns.
   Therefore, decisions must be reached in a systematic approach by
   scrutinizing the system-specific knowledge (SSK) provided by many
   disciplines.
   2. This paper is organized into five sections: following the
   introduction (Section 1), Section 2 sets a framework for the numerous
   elements of the SSK that can serve as a checklist to identify
   potentially important topics for a particular management decision;
   Section 3 illustrates errors in stream-management policies that have
   been made because the SSK was not considered; Section 4 demonstrates how
   the SSK can be applied in formulating appropriate stream- and
   water-management policies; finally Section 5 summarizes the major points
   in the context of alternative stream-management strategies.
   3. Examples on limiting values in Europe, restrictions of NH4-N
   emission, and the routine application of the Saprobian index demonstrate
   that current management practices often ignore the SSK.
   4. Combining trivial elements of the SSK we demonstrate how complex
   problems of stream management can be solved, focusing on the sources,
   sinks, and effects of water, organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.
   5. On the basis of costs and effects, we rate various management options
   for a fictitious north German lowland catchment. If that catchment does
   not carry a dense human population, SSK-based management is distinctly
   more efficient than traditional management, which focuses on a minor
   sink (sewer system plus sewage treatment plant).
   6. Stream management ignoring the SSK wastes financial, intellectual,
   and natural resources. If we project the estimated costs for
   water-resource management in Germany over the forthcoming decade on to
   the standards of recent European Community (EC) guidelines concerning
   this subject, a large portion of a sum of around \$US 1-2 trillion
   (10(12)) will be squandered in the EC unless practices change.
   7. The results of our analysis are rather disturbing and suggest that
   totally different practices are needed in legislation, administration
   and execution, monitoring, and research. Therefore, we propose that our
   paper be the starting point for a discussion involving representatives
   of all relevant disciplines about potential priorities for new
   management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns the ways that our philosophical attitudes to the
   environment can influence the appropriateness of methodologies for
   solving environmental problems. Sometimes a public perception is
   expressed that science takes scant regard of the concerns of the people
   affected. Is it possible for scientists and managers to respond to such
   concerns and still fulfil the logical and methodological rigour that
   their discipline demands? I believe we have to address fundamental
   issues of definitions and meaning before useful debate can occur among
   parties interested in environmental decision-making. Delving into the
   ideas behind our everyday practices of environmental management should
   promote re-evaluation of our beliefs, attitudes and concerns about
   nature.
   I examine environmental science from both ethical and managerial
   perspectives. I explore how our assumptions and attitudes might
   influence ecology, in particular issues raised by environmental impacts
   and conservation. The major points argued here are: (1) Any legal
   requirements of environmental investigations must be met, but perhaps we
   should act more in line with the spirit of legislation. (2) The
   managerial imperatives of environmental investigations need to be
   examined closely because of widely perceived problems with the use of
   science in impact assessment. We must change either our methods of
   assessment or the regulations and administration of environmental impact
   assessment (EIA). (3) Science is not paramount in the processes of
   environmental decision-making. We need to be aware of how psychosocial
   factors affect the ultimately political decisions about environmental
   problems. (4) Philosophy and ethics offer a range of perspectives that
   may benefit ecology. Scientists need to be aware of these just as they
   should be of their own leanings about how we treat nature. (5)
   Scientists need to translate social concerns or demands about the
   environment into properly defined scientific questions, and then study
   them as a matter of urgency. (6) Ecology needs to guide ecophilosophers
   and environmental ethicists as to how nature works, why we expect
   variability in ecosystems, what is naturalness, and other issues where a
   scientific understanding of nature has progressed beyond the point where
   these observers of ecology have so far taken inspiration.}},

Abstract = {{In full sunlight (photosynthetic photon flux density, 0.4-0.7 mum,
   PPFD), stomatal conductance to water vapor (g) and transpiration rates
   (E) are usually higher, and water use efficiency lower, in C3 than C4
   species. In the C3 grass Bromus inermis, the difference in conductance
   between full sun (photosynthetic photon flux {[}PPFD] > 1500
   mumol.M-2.s-1) and shade (PPFD almost-equal-to 400 mumol-m-2.s-1) was
   twice as large as in the C4 species Sorghastrum nutans (226.7 vs. 97.8
   mmol.m-2.s-1, respectively). Similar differences were measured in four
   additional C3 and C4 grasses. Variability in PPFD incident on leaves is
   very common in grasslands, and stomata are known to respond relatively
   rapidly to fluctuations in this resource. This study evaluated the
   consequences of different responses in stomatal conductance between C3
   and C4 grasses during periods of sunlight variability. Photosynthesis
   (A, measured as CO2 uptake) and g varied substantially in both B.
   inermis and S. nutans as PPFD fluctuated between sun and shade levels
   (4-10 min intervals). Time constants derived from first-order equations
   describing responses in g after abrupt changes in PPFD indicated that g
   approached steady-state levels more rapidly in S. nutans than in B.
   inermis. However, because of the greater magnitude of change in g
   between sun and shade PPFD in B. inermis, the absolute rate of change in
   g in this C3 grass was twice as rapid compared to S. nutans (25.7 vs.
   12.4 mmol.m-2.s-1.min-1 for reductions in g, respectively). New
   steady-state levels in g were achieved in 12-13 min after a change in
   PPFD in S. nutans and 15-19 min in B. inermis.
   A statistically based two-state (sun/shade) simulation model was used to
   quantify costs in A and E of the nonsteady-state responses measured for
   both species as PPFD varied. Costs were calculated as the difference
   between model output of A or E based on field responses and model output
   based on hypothetical ps exchange responses in which A and g changed
   instantaneously. Results suggested that even though the absolute rate of
   change in g was greater in the C3 grass, costs in E during periods of
   short-term (2-6 min) variations in PPFD were as much as sixfold higher
   than in the C4 species. Lower cost in E in C4 species during periods of
   variable PPFD (due to inherently smaller alterations in g) is a
   previously unrecognized consequence of the C4 photosynthetic pathway. C4
   species, and grasses in particular, often are most successful in
   high-PPFD, water-limited environments in which leaf-level variability in
   PPFD occurs daily from cloud cover and within-canopy shading. In these
   environments, stomatal responses that conserve water under
   nonsteady-state conditions may contribute significantly to the success
   of C4 species.}},

Pages = {{749-765}},
Abstract = {{1. Communities develop through a process, community assembly in which
   species invade, persist, or become extinct.
   2. Community assembly is a sequence of different community states. Each
   state is a unique combination of species' presence or absence. The
   community transition graph is the directed graph of the transitions
   between states. Not all the transition graphs are ecologically sensible.
   3. We investigated the statistical distribution of different community
   transition graphs that contain varying numbers of species. Does the
   species composition of a community persist? Or does it cycle, and, if
   so, through a few recognizable states or through a complex sequence that
   might appear superficially random?
   4. We employ three recipes to construct the transition graphs. In the
   random transition graphs, the directions of the transitions are
   specified entirely at random. In the second recipe, we exclude all
   cycles by assigning each state a random `height.' The community
   transition graph moves from a `lower' state to one of its `higher'
   neighbours. This produces landscape transition graphs. The third recipe
   adds one ecological constraint to the random assembly models. We remove
   the simple, ecologically implausible cycles to produce minimal
   transition graphs.
   5. Random transition graphs most commonly have one persistent state.
   Landscape transition graphs commonly have many more persistent states
   and the number increases rapidly with the number of species in the
   system. Persistent cycles are rare in the random graphs and are
   impossible in the landscape graphs.
   6. Persistent states are nearly always reachable from the empty
   community in the random graphs. In the landscape graphs, with increasing
   numbers of species, the total number of persistent states increases more
   quickly than the number of reachable states.
   7. Cyclical changes in composition en route to a persistent state are a
   dominant feature of the random graphs. The path lengths to a persistent
   state are often very long.
   8. The third recipe excludes only the simple cycles. These minimal
   transition graphs have more than one persistent state. The number of
   persistent states increases rapidly with the number of species in the
   model. We did not find persistent cycles. Thus, models with even minimal
   ecological constraints appear very similar to the landscape transition
   graphs. Assembly resembles the process of evolution. It looks as though
   there is something that pushes the assembly towards peaks in a
   landscape.
   9. Natural communities have had time to reach their persistent states,
   damaged communities are new ones. The persistent composition of natural
   communities should contrast with the ephemeral composition of damaged
   communities.
   10. Ecological restoration may face the following dilemma. Random graphs
   may best describe community restoration. If so, the restoration might
   eventually reach its desired persistent community but only after a long
   period of intermediate cycling. In contrast, if landscape or minimal
   graphs best describe restoration, then it would quickly reach a
   persistent community. Unfortunately, this persistent community may not
   be the desired community. Even with all the species, we may be unable to
   reassemble communities.
   11. The rugged nature of community landscapes produced from minimal
   assumptions suggests that the diversity of natural communities is a
   probable result of accidents of history.}},

Abstract = {{A water mite, Piona exigua, is the dominant invertebrate predator in
   some New Zealand lakes. To establish the extent to which this predator
   has an impact on the populations of its prey species, we have analysed
   the effect of prey availability on quantitative estimates of predation.
   We describe Piona functional responses generated under a range of
   conditions and compare them using `parallel curve analysis' and a
   maximum likelihood method of estimating curve parameters. This method
   overcomes the difficulties of comparing parameters across different
   combinations of predator and prey type.
   Rates of predation on a range of cladoceran prey show `thresholds' of
   prey size at which rates change abruptly. These thresholds are specific
   to each size of predator. Females, males and nymphs of Piona exhibit
   their highest predation rates on Daphnia carinata, Ceriodaphnia and
   Chydorus, respectively. These rates are relatively insensitive to
   temperatures above 15-degrees-C. Predation rates of adult Piona on
   Daphnia < 1.5 mm in length were similar to those of fourth instar
   Chaoborus at the same temperature and prey density.}},

   DIVERSITY}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{1993}},
Number = {{123}},
Pages = {{1-41}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The conventional approach to maintaining biological diversity generally
   has been to proceed species by species and threat by threat. We suggest
   that piecemeal approaches are not adequate by themselves to address the
   accelerating extinction crisis and, furthermore, they contribute to an
   unpredictable ecological and economic environment. Here, we describe a
   methodology called Gap Analysis, which identifies the gaps in
   representation of biological diversity (biodiversity) in areas managed
   exclusively or primarily for the long-term maintenance of populations of
   native species and natural ecosystems (hereinafter referred to as
   biodiversity management areas). Once identified, gaps are filled through
   new reserve acquisitions or designations, or through changes in
   management practices. The goal is to ensure that all ecosystems and
   areas rich in species diversity are represented adequately in
   biodiversity management areas. We believe this proactive strategy will
   eliminate the need to list many species as threatened or endangered in
   the future.
   Gap Analysis uses vegetation types and vertebrate and butterfly species
   (and/or other taxa, such as vascular plants, if adequate distributional
   data are available) as indicators of biodiversity. Maps of existing
   vegetation are prepared from satellite imagery (LANDSAT) and other
   sources and entered into a geographic information system (GIS). Because
   entire states or regions are mapped, the smallest area identified on
   vegetation maps is 100 ha. Vegetation maps are verified through field
   checks and examination of aerial photographs.
   Predicted species distributions are based on existing range maps and
   other distributional data, combined with information on the habitat
   affinities of each species. Distribution maps for individual species are
   overlaid in the GIS to produce maps of species richness, which can be
   created for any group of species of biological or political interest. An
   additional GIS layer of land ownership and management status allows
   identification of gaps in the representation of vegetation types and
   centers of species richness in biodiversity management areas through a
   comparison of the vegetation and species richness maps with ownership
   and management status maps. Underrepresented plant communities (e.g.,
   present on only 1 or 2 biodiversity management areas or with a small
   total acreage primarily managed for biodiversity) also can be identified
   in this manner. Realization of the full potential of Gap Analysis
   requires regionalization of state data bases and use of the data in
   resource management and planning.
   Gap Analysis is a powerful and efficient first step toward setting land
   management priorities. It provides focus, direction, and accountability
   for conservation efforts. Areas identified as important through Gap
   Analysis can then be examined more closely for their biological
   qualities and management needs. As a coarse-filter approach to
   conservation evaluation, Gap Analysis is not a panacea. Limitations
   related to minimum mapping unit size (where small habitat patches are
   missed), failure to distinguish among most seral stages, failure to
   indicate gradual ecotones, and other factors must be recognized so that
   Gap Analysis can be supplemented by more intensive inventories.}},

Abstract = {{Five years after planting and initial treatment we examined the response
   of a microbial community to three intensive silvicultural practices:
   soil surface modification (scarification), fertilization, and control of
   competing vegetation by herbicide. We correlated microbial response with
   changes in environmental conditions following treatment, including soil
   temperature and moisture, total and available nutrients in soil, and
   light intensity in the tree canopy.
   The microbial biomass C (2.1-5.3 mg/g in the F/H horizon and 0. 14-0.62
   mg/g in the surface mineral soil) as determined by the
   fumigation-extraction method was reduced by vegetation control and
   fertilization. The ratio of microbial to total organic carbon
   (C(mic)/C(org)) was also reduced by vegetation control, and tended to
   increase in the new organic horizon developed during the 5 yr after soil
   surface scarification. Microbial biomass N (0. 1 5-0.40 mg/g in the F/H
   horizon and 0.014 to 0.057 mg/g in the mineral soil) was not affected by
   the treatments. The microbial community structure (relative volumes of
   bacteria and fungi) was evaluated on glass slides placed in the litter
   bags of pine and aspen litter. The treatment effects on the relative
   volumes of microorganisms on slides were similar to effects noted for
   microbial biomass C in the soil.
   Five years of vegetation succession resulted in conservative N cycling
   and N limitation of the plant community in control plots. In response to
   silvicultural treatments this state may either remain relatively
   unchanged after fertilization, the N limitation may be increased
   (scarification), or apparent C limitation induced (vegetation control).
   Reducing the nutrient pool by scarification caused an apparent nutrient
   limitation, and the microbial community tended to widen the C/N ratio.
   Increasing the nutrient pool by fertilization or vegetation control
   tended to narrow the C/N ratio of microbial biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Locomotion and fin coordination of the only living crossopterygian fish
   Latimeria chalumnae were studied with submersibles in the fish's natural
   habitat at around 200 m depth off Grand Comoro, western Indian Ocean.
   Latimeria is a highly specialized predatory fish adapted for nocturnal
   drift hunting with good fast start capability. Twelve different forward
   movements and manoeuvres were found and described. The movements of the
   paired and unpaired fins were analysed. Propulsion was accomplished with
   downstrokes of the pectoral fins and right-left or left-right strokes of
   the unpaired lobed fins. The paired fins were not used for walking on
   the bottom. Swimming velocity, stroke amplitudes and stroke duration
   were analysed from films and videos taken in the wild. Stroke duration
   of the paired and unpaired lobed fins was similar and varies between 1.9
   to 5.8 sec. Paired fins alternated synchronously. The coordination at
   approximately empty set = 180-degrees between opposite paired fins is
   stable and independent of locomotory pattern and velocity. A phase
   deviation of about 90-degrees-100-degrees exists between paired and
   unpaired fins. A model is developed that describes the functional
   implication of this deviation as a method of producing a steady swimming
   performance which smooths recoil movements and prevents rotation of the
   body. The novel slow and fast swimming mode of Latimeria is named in
   accordance with Breder's (1926) descriptive nomenclature as
   `coelacanthiform'. This study indicates a primary swimming function for
   the primitive sarcopterygian fin and confirms earlier evolutionary
   assumptions of a more open-water life style of coelacanth fishes.
   Paleoethological models of the walking habits of Latimeria have to be
   rejected. Synchronous alternation of paired fins originating from
   hydrodynamic demands could be a pre-adaptation and a shared derived
   character in sarcopterygian fishes that facilitated the fish-tetrapod
   transition.}},

Abstract = {{We contend that humans, as living organisms, evolved to sequester
   resources to maximize reproductive success, and that many basic aspects
   of human behaviour reflect this evolutionary history. Much of the
   environment with which we currently deal is evolutionarily novel, and
   much behaviour which is ultimately not in our own interests, persists in
   this novel environment. Environmentalists frequently stress the need for
   `sustainable development', however it is defined (see Redclift, 1987),
   and we contend that a knowledge of how humans are likely to behave with
   regard to resource use, and therefore a knowledge of what kinds of
   programmes are likely to work in any particular situation, is necessary
   to achieve sustainability. Specifically, we predict that issues which
   are short-term, local, and/or acute, such as an immediate health-risk,
   will be much easier to solve than issues which are broad, and which
   affect individuals other than ourselves, our relatives, and our friends.
   The bigger the issue is, the less effective is likely to be the
   response. Hence, the biggest and most troublesome ecological issues will
   be the most difficult to solve - inter alia because of our evolutionary
   history as outlined above.
   This may not appear to bode well for the future of the world; for
   example, Molte (1988) contends that there are several hundred
   international environmental agreements in place, but Carroll (1988)
   contends that, in general, none of them is particularly effective if the
   criterion for effectiveness is a real solution to the problem. There are
   countless examples of `aggressors' (those nations causing the problem)
   not complying with an agreement, slowing its ratification, or reducing
   its effectiveness (e.g. the US versus Canada, or Great Britain versus
   Sweden, with regard to acid rain legislation: Fig. 1, cf. Bjorkbom,
   1988). The main problem in these cases is that the costs are
   externalized and hence discounted by those receiving the benefits of
   being able to pollute. Any proposed change is bound to conflict with
   existing social structures, and negotiations necessarily involve
   compromise in a quid pro quo fashion (Brewer, 1980). We contend, along
   with Caldwell (1988) and Putnam (1988), than nations are much too large
   to think of as individual actors in these spheres. Interest groups
   within nations can affect ratification of international environmental
   treaties; for example, automobile industry interests versus those of
   environmental NGOs in the USA on the acid rain issue. It may even be
   that our evolutionary history is inimical to the entire concept of die
   modem nation state.
   Barring major, global, socio-political upheaval, we suggest that a
   knowledge of the evolution of resource use by humans can be used to
   solve at least some resource-related problems in modem industrial
   societies. In some cases, these can probably be solved with information
   alone, and in other cases, the problems can probably be solved by
   playing on our evolutionary history as social reciprocators;
   environmental problems which tend to be relatively local and short-term
   may be solvable in these ways. Economic incentives can provide solutions
   to many other types of problems by manipulating die cost and benefits to
   individuals. We suggest that broader, large-scale environmental problems
   are much more difficult to solve than narrower, small-scale ones,
   precisely because humans have evolved to discount such themes; stringent
   regulations and the formation of coalitions, combined with economic
   incentives to use alternatives and economic disincentives (fines) not to
   do so, may be die only potential solutions to some major, transboundary
   environmental issues.
   In preparing this argument, we have reviewed literature from many
   scholarly fields well outside the narrow scope of our expertise in
   behavioural ecology and wildlife conservation. Our reading of many works
   from anthropology, economics, political science, public policy, and
   international development, will doubtless seem naive and simplistic to
   practitioners of those fields, and solving all environmental problems
   will ultimately take expertise from all of these fields and more. In
   general, however, we have found agreement for many of our ideas from
   these disparate disciplines, but much of their literature does not allow
   for a rigorous, quantitative hypothesis-testing approach to analysing
   the main thesis presented here - an approach that we, as scientists,
   would encourage. We hope to challenge people interested in environmental
   issues from many perspectives, to consider our arguments and find
   evidence, pro or con, so that we (collectively) may come closer to a
   better analysis of, and ultimately to solutions for, our most pressing
   environmental problems.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variability at a locus under stabilizing selection in a finite
   population is investigated using analytic methods and computer
   simulations.  Three measures are examined:  the number of alleles k,
   heterozygosity H, and additive genetic variance V(g).  A nearly-neutral
   theory results.  The composite parameter S = NV(M)/V(s) (where N is the
   population size, V(M) the variance of new mutant allelic effects and
   V(s) the weakness of stabilizing selection) figures prominently in the
   results.  The equilibrium heterozygosity is similar to that of strictly
   neutral theory, H = 4N-mu(e)/(1 + 4N-mu(e)), except that mu(e) =
   mu/square-root 1 + cS where c is about 0.5.  Simulations corroborate
   V(g) = 4-mu-V(s)/1 + 1/S except for very low N.  Genetic variability
   attains similar equilibrium values at both a ``lone{''} locus and at an
   ``embedded{''} locus.  This agrees with my earlier work concerning
   molecular clock rates.  These results modify the neutralist
   interpretation of data concerning genetic variability and genetic
   distances between populations.  Low H values are proportional not to N
   but to square-root N.  This may explain the narrow observed range of H
   among species.  Heterozygosities need not be highly correlated to
   genetic variances.  Genetic variances are not highly dependent on
   population size except in very small populations which are difficult to
   sample without bias because the smallest populations go extinct the
   fastest.  Nearly neutral evolution will not be easily distinguished from
   strictly neutral theory under the Hudson-Kreitman-Aguade
   inter-/intraspecific variation ratio test, since a similar effective
   mutation rate holds for genetic distances and D = 2-mu(e)t, where mu(e)
   = mu/square-root 1 + S.  As with strictly neutral theory, comparisons
   across loci should show D and H to be positively correlated because of
   the shared mu(e).  But unlike neutral theory, for a given locus,
   comparisons across species should show D and H to be negatively
   correlated.  There is no obvious threshold of population size below
   which genetic variability inevitably declines.  Extinction depends on
   both genetic variation and natural selection.  Neither theory nor
   observation presently indicates the measure of genetic variability (k,
   H, V(G) or other) that best indicates vulnerability of a small
   population to extinction.}},

Pages = {{315-327}},
Abstract = {{1. Two-phase mosaics (densely vegetated patches regularly alternating
   with almost bare areas) occur on smooth slopes of many arid lands of the
   world as a result of rainwater redistribution through sheet-flow run
   off. This paper reports the vegetation dynamics (through synchronic and
   diachronic approaches) of both the upslope and downslope fringes of
   vegetated patches (vegetation arcs) located in the Chihuahuan Desert,
   Mexico. 2. Ten vegetation arcs were used in a synchronic study and one
   of them in an 8-year diachronic study (1982-90). Data gathered in
   2-m-wide, 8-15-m-long grids of 25-cm x 25-cm contiguous quadrats were
   used to study the variation of species richness, life-form dominance,
   dominance-diversity relationships and species composition across the
   fringes. 3. A colonization process developed in the upslope fringes; (i)
   species richness increased gradually to a peak and then decreased, as
   would be expected in an ecotone; (ii) this peak coincided spatially with
   a change in life form and floristic dominance; and (iii) communities
   with geometric-like distributions of abundance were replaced by
   communities with log-normal-like distributions of abundance, which are
   common in successional processes. 4. The diachronic study showed that
   the peak of species richness had moved upslope with a concomitant
   colonization of new space in that direction. The displacement of that
   peak, coupled with changes over time in the dominance of life forms and
   in the dominance-diversity relationships, provided additional evidence
   that a successional process of colonization develops. Likewise,
   long-term variations in floristic composition of the upslope quadrats
   were explained by time, position along the grid and rainfall, in order
   of decreasing importance. 5. There was a determinism both in the life
   form and in the floristic replacement processes observed upslope,
   suggesting a general scheme of obligatory succession. The bare area was
   colonized by short-lived perennials and/or facultative therophytes that
   almost never appear in the main body of the arcs. These species are
   gradually replaced by tussock grasses and seedlings of woody species
   which are the dominants in the main body of the arcs. 6. A different
   process can be inferred from the structural variability in space
   observed in the downslope fringes. A spatially non-contagious variation
   in species richness, a spatially non-patterned variation in life-form
   dominance, and a constancy in geometric-like dominance-diversity
   relationships suggested that colonization processes were not developing.
   A long-term decrease in species richness as well as in life-form
   diversity and a reduction in the abundance of tussock grasses suggested
   that a process of senescence without new recruitments was occurring.
   Analysis of the variation of floristic data through time showed the
   floristic impoverishment of a grassland community dominated by Hilaria
   mutica coupled with a reduction in the abundance of that species. 7. The
   dynamics of colonization of bare areas in two-phase mosaics offers an
   example of succession in arid lands that is probably present in all the
   world areas where these two-phase mosaics have been reported (the Middle
   East, Africa, Australia and North America).}},

   climatology simulated by this model is strongly dependent upon the
   fraction of the grid square, mu, receiving precipitation.  It is also
   shown that fundamentally different hydrological regimes (one runoff
   dominated, the other evaporation dominated) are obtained for the
   otherwise identical situations.  It is argued that the new generation of
   land surface models which explicitly incorporate vegetation may have to
   be `re-tuned' if differences between large-scale and small-scale
   precipitation events are accommodated in AGCMs.  If precipitation is
   always assumed to fall uniformly over the grid square, the precipitation
   intensity will generally be underestimated.  This will lead to an
   overestimation of canopy interception and interception loss. 
   Furthermore, too little precipitation will reach the soil surface, and
   therefore surface runoff and the soil moisture will be underestimated. 
   With too much interception loss, and too little soil water (and soil
   evaporation) there will be a tendency to re-cycle precipitation back to
   the atmosphere too quickly, leading to the unrealistic simulation of
   surface-atmosphere interactions.  These results, if reproduced within an
   AGCM, would invalidate previous simulations of the effects of changing
   the state of the land surface on the atmosphere.}},
