Title = {{Horizon scanning for invasive alien species with the potential to

Abstract = {{Invasive alien species (IAS) are considered one of the greatest threats
   to biodiversity, particularly through their interactions with other
   drivers of change. Horizon scanning, the systematic examination of
   future potential threats and opportunities, leading to prioritization of
   IAS threats is seen as an essential component of IAS management. Our aim
   was to consider IAS that were likely to impact on native biodiversity
   but were not yet established in the wild in Great Britain. To achieve
   this, we developed an approach which coupled consensus methods (which
   have previously been used for collaboratively identifying priorities in
   other contexts) with rapid risk assessment. The process involved two
   distinct phases:
   1. Preliminary consultation with experts within five groups (plants,
   terrestrial invertebrates, freshwater invertebrates, vertebrates and
   marine species) to derive ranked lists of potential IAS. 2.
   Consensus-building across expert groups to compile and rank the entire
   list of potential IAS.
   Five hundred and ninety-one species not native to Great Britain were
   considered. Ninety-three of these species were agreed to constitute at
   least a medium risk (based on score and consensus) with respect to them
   arriving, establishing and posing a threat to native biodiversity. The
   quagga mussel, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, received maximum scores
   for risk of arrival, establishment and impact; following discussions the
   unanimous consensus was to rank it in the top position. A further 29
   species were considered to constitute a high risk and were grouped
   according to their ranked risk. The remaining 63 species were considered
   as medium risk, and included in an unranked long list. The information
   collated through this novel extension of the consensus method for
   horizon scanning provides evidence for underpinning and prioritizing
   management both for the species and, perhaps more importantly, their
   pathways of arrival. Although our study focused on Great Britain, we
   suggest that the methods adopted are applicable globally.}},

Volume = {{281}},
Number = {{1795}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of climatic niche specialization has important
   implications for many topics in ecology, evolution and conservation. The
   climatic niche reflects the set of temperature and precipitation
   conditions where a species can occur. Thus, specialization to a limited
   set of climatic conditions can be important for understanding patterns
   of biogeography, species richness, community structure, allopatric
   speciation, spread of invasive species and responses to climate change.
   Nevertheless, the factors that determine climatic niche width (level of
   specialization) remain poorly explored. Here, we test whether species
   that occur in more extreme climates are more highly specialized for
   those conditions, and whether there are trade-offs between niche widths
   on different climatic niche axes (e. g. do species that tolerate a broad
   range of temperatures tolerate only a limited range of precipitation
   regimes?). We test these hypotheses in amphibians, using phylogenetic
   comparative methods and global-scale datasets, including 2712 species
   with both climatic and phylogenetic data. Our results do not support
   either hypothesis. Rather than finding narrower niches in more extreme
   environments, niches tend to be narrower on one end of a climatic
   gradient but wider on the other. We also find that temperature and
   precipitation niche breadths are positively related, rather than showing
   trade-offs. Finally, our results suggest that most amphibian species
   occur in relatively warm and dry environments and have relatively narrow
   climatic niche widths on both of these axes. Thus, they may be
   especially imperilled by anthropogenic climate change.}},

Abstract = {{In order to predict the fate of biodiversity in a rapidly changing

   We find that these species' environmental preferences are stable across

   environmental perturbations. The results suggest that species will
   respond to current and future warming either by altering distributions
   to track suitable habitat or, if the pace of change is too rapid, by

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1236-1246}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. Animals of many species demonstrate movement behaviour in which
   decisions are based on a variety of information. Effects of resources
   have been studied widely, often under the assumption that the
   environment is constant over the course of the study. Much less
   understood is the role of dynamic information about continuously
   changing resource availability and past experiences. Such information
   can be acquired during movement bouts and used for future decisions via
   memory. We present a new class of animal movement models, which
   incorporates a dynamic interplay of movement and information gain
   processes. Information is contained in a dynamic cognitive map. As an
   example, we consider time since last visit to locations and how this
   interacts with environmental information to shape movement patterns. Our
   models can be fitted to empirical movement trajectories and are
   therefore amenable to statistical inference (parameter estimation and
   model selection). We tested the functionality of our method using
   simulated data. Parameter estimates were in accordance with true values
   used in the simulations, and model selection via Bayesian information
   criterion (BIC) was able to identify true underlying mechanisms of
   simulated trajectories. Thus, if time since last visit to locations
   influences movement decisions, our method is able to detect this
   mechanism. The use of dynamic information such as the one demonstrated
   in our example models likely requires cognitive abilities such as
   spatial memory. Therefore, our method can be used to reveal evidence of
   spatial memory in empirical movement data. Understanding the components
   of individual movement decisions and their interactions ultimately helps
   us to predict how population distribution patterns respond to
   environmental changes, such as landscape fragmentation and changing
   climate.}},

Abstract = {{Blue carbon - the carbon stored and sequestered in mangrove forests,
   seagrass meadows, and tidal salt marshes is considered a cost-effective
   means to achieve positive climate change mitigation and adaptation

   relation to carbon markets and climate finance opportunities. This paper
   identifies peer-reviewed and `gray literature' documents that discuss
   blue carbon in the context of finance and market mechanisms. The
   document set is analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively, and the
   principal scientific, economic, regulatory, social, and management
   issues that emerge are discussed. The study reveals that (1) the blue

   a dearth of research into practical social considerations and a stark
   absence of private sector perspectives; (2) there is confusion over the
   nature and role of important concepts including private and public

Abstract = {{Integrated ecological and economic solutions are increasingly sought

Journal = {{RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{603-613}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Rangeland management is largely focused on managing vegetation change.
   Objectives may include managing against change if the desired vegetation
   is in place, or attempting to create a shift in vegetation if the
   desired plant community is not present. There is a rich body of research
   documenting influences of disturbance and management on rangeland
   vegetation. However, in many cases the information is largely
   observational and does not identify mechanisms driving change. We
   propose using the regeneration niche concept to more effectively predict
   when vegetation change is possible and to suggest successional
   direction. Simply stated, as plants die and leave gaps in the community,
   recruitment of new individuals will dictate successional direction.
   Recruitment requires that propagules are present, that the propagules
   find safe sites in which to establish, and that the seedlings and young
   plants are able to compete with existing vegetation and survive. In many
   rangeland communities, perennial bunchgrasses are a key to stability and
   invasion resistance. Existing literature shows that most rangeland
   bunchgrasses have average life spans of 10 yr or less, so periodic
   recruitment is necessary to maintain communities in which they are a
   major component. Disturbance can influence plant population dynamics,
   and we suggest classifying disturbances based on how they influence
   mortality and recruitment. We also suggest that more emphasis be placed
   on the concept of critical transitions and less on the degree of
   disturbance per se. In other words, a small disturbance at the wrong
   point in community composition (low plant density and high gap size for
   example) can cause a transition, whereas major disturbance in a high
   condition community may yield little risk of transition. We suggest that
   a focus on mortality and recruitment will provide a mechanistic approach
   for predicting vegetation change and making management decisions. We
   refer to this approach as recruitment-based management.}},

Abstract = {{Two fundamental axes - space and time - shape ecological systems. Over

   ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation and loss. We argue that
   accelerating climate change - the effective manipulation of time by
   humans - has generated a current need to build an equivalent framework
   for temporal ecology. Climate change has at once pressed ecologists to
   understand and predict ecological dynamics in non-stationary
   environments, while also challenged fundamental assumptions of many
   concepts, models and approaches. However, similarities between space and
   time, especially related issues of scaling, provide an outline for
   improving ecological models and forecasting of temporal dynamics, while
   the unique attributes of time, particularly its emphasis on events and
   its singular direction, highlight where new approaches are needed. We
   emphasise how a renewed, interdisciplinary focus on time would coalesce
   related concepts, help develop new theories and methods and guide
   further data collection. The next challenge will be to unite predictive
   frameworks from spatial and temporal ecology to build robust forecasts

Abstract = {{The important questions about agriculture, climate, and sustainability
   have become increasingly complex and require a coordinated, multifaceted
   approach for developing new knowledge and understanding. A multistate,
   transdisciplinary project was begun in 2011 to study the potential for
   both mitigation and adaptation of corn-based cropping systems to climate
   variations. The team is measuring the baseline as well as change of the
   system's carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and water footprints, crop
   productivity, and pest pressure in response to existing and novel
   production practices. Nine states and 11 institutions are participating
   in the project, necessitating a well thought out approach to
   coordinating field data collection procedures at 35 research sites. In
   addition, the collected data must be brought together in a way that can
   be stored and used by persons not originally involved in the data
   collection, necessitating robust procedures for linking metadata with
   the data and clearly delineated rules for use and publication of data
   from the overall project. In order to improve the ability to compare
   data across sites and begin to make inferences about soil and cropping
   system responses to climate across the region, detailed research
   protocols were developed to standardize the types of measurements taken
   and the specific details such as depth, time, method, numbers of
   samples, and minimum data set required from each site. This process
   required significant time, debate, and commitment of all the
   investigators involved with field data collection and was also informed
   by the data needed to run the simulation models and life cycle analyses.
   Although individual research teams are collecting additional
   measurements beyond those stated in the standardized protocols, the
   written protocols are used by the team for the base measurements to be
   compared across the region. A centralized database was constructed to
   meet the needs of current researchers on this project as well as for

Abstract = {{Tropical mountains are hotspots of biodiversity, but the factors that
   generate this high diversity remain poorly understood. To identify
   possible mechanisms that influence avian species assemblages in the
   tropical Andes, we studied the functional and phylogenetic diversity and
   the structure of species assemblages of an avian feeding guild. We
   analysed how functional and phylogenetic diversity, structure and
   composition of frugivorous bird assemblages changed along a 3300 m
   elevational transect from the lowlands to the tree line with a novel
   combination of functional and phylogenetic approaches, and used null
   models to infer possible drivers of the observed patterns. Species
   richness, functional richness and phylogenetic diversity decreased
   almost monotonically with increasing elevation, but assemblage structure
   and composition changed abruptly in the Andean foothills at around 1200
   m. In the lowland assemblages, species were functionally and
   phylogenetically less similar than expected from null models, whereas
   species in the highland assemblages were functionally and
   phylogenetically more similar than expected by chance, suggesting an
   abrupt reduction in the number of functionally and phylogenetically
   distinct species in the transition from lowlands to the highlands.
   Nevertheless, the functional and phylogenetic evenness of the
   assemblages, i.e. the regularity of the spacing of species in functional
   trait space and phylogeny, remained constant along the gradient, which
   suggests that the mechanisms that influence the co-occurrence of species
   within the assemblages are similar in lowlands and highlands. The
   observed differences between lowland and highland assemblages imply
   sharp distributional limits for frugivorous bird species in the Andean
   foothills, probably caused by environmental factors other than climate,
   e.g. changes in habitat types or topography, or independent species
   radiations in lowlands and highlands. These strong distributional limits
   may hinder uphill range shifts of frugivorous bird species, and the
   plant species they disperse, in the tropical Andes as a response to
   climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate determination of the population density of key focal species is
   necessary for monitoring the success of management programs and
   ecosystem health across a wide range of contexts. Unfortunately, many
   key taxa are visually cryptic and thus difficult to count using
   traditional observation-based techniques. Bell miners (Manorina
   melanophrys), are just such a species. They are widespread throughout
   south-eastern Australia, yet they are critical to monitor given their
   association and potential causal link to spreading vegetative dieback in
   this region. A new passive acoustic monitoring technique was trialled by
   testing its ability to determine population densities of bell miner
   colonies via counting the distinctive tink' vocalization of this
   species. This call was given at a constant rate per individual, and at a
   common amplitude across 10 colonies throughout the entire geographic
   range of the species. Theoretical sound transmission and playback trials
   through typical habitat determined that any bird within a 50-m radius of
   the recorders used would be louder than 70dB, enabling this threshold
   amplitude to be used to determine the number of birds in a 50m radius of
   the recorder. Field trials of the acoustic protocol versus human
   observers using traditional visual surveys found that passive acoustic
   monitoring was able to detect more individuals, using a less expensive
   protocol that drastically reduced the need for observer training or
   expertise. Sound therefore offers a reliable method for determining the

Abstract = {{AimTo understand the causes of historical and current elevational
   richness patterns of Leiothrichinae babblers, a diverse and mostly
   endemic group of birds.
   LocationA 5000-m elevational gradient in the Hengduan Mountains, China.
   MethodsBy means of a dated phylogenetic tree and reconstructed ancestral
   states, we estimated elevation-specific diversification rate, applied a
   new method to estimate colonization frequency and age and, for the first
   time, modelled historical species richness patterns that take account of
   temporal patterns of palaeotemperature. As explanations for current
   richness patterns, we assessed area, geometric constraints, temperature,
   precipitation, seasonality and productivity.
   ResultsThe current elevational pattern of species richness is a
   hump-shaped curve with a peak at about 1000-2500m. The reconstructed
   palaeopatterns of species richness suggest that babblers, as a clade,
   first occupied the Hengduan Mountains at low to mid-elevations, although
   the method of ancestral state reconstruction cannot conclusively reject
   origins outside the current elevational distribution of the group.
   Diversification rates varied little along the elevational gradient, and
   thus cannot explain the richness pattern, but historical colonization
   frequency and colonization age were highly correlated with present-day
   species richness. Seasonality and productivity had greater power than
   area and geometric constraints in explaining the present-day richness
   pattern of babblers along the elevational gradient.
   ConclusionsHistorical and modern factors have both played important
   roles in shaping species richness patterns. Reconstructed historical
   richness patterns suggest that babblers first diversified in the
   Hengduan Mountains at low to mid elevations, but richness patterns
   almost certainly shifted substantially under changing climates of the
   past 10 Myr. The current richness patterns of babblers are associated
   with seasonality and productivity, but they are also a product of
   historical evolutionary and ecological dynamics. The methods we
   introduce for assessing historical colonization rates and past patterns
   of richness offer promise for understanding other elevational richness
   gradients.}},

Abstract = {{In British Columbia, large-scale salvage harvesting has been underway to
   recover timber value from forest stands infested by mountain pine beetle
   during the current outbreak. Understanding the response of beetles to
   clearcut edges particularly at the landscape scale is crucial to
   understanding the impacts of increased habitat fragmentation due to
   salvage harvesting on the spread of the beetle infestations. A novel
   proximity analysis approach based on null models of complete spatial
   randomness with three different spatial extents was developed to examine
   the spatial patterns of infestations in relation to cutblocks.
   Inhomogeneous Poisson point process models were fitted to predict how
   intensities of infestations varied with distances to the nearest
   cutblocks. Marked Poisson point process models were also fitted to
   evaluate the effects of the variables associated with the nearest
   cutblocks and adjacent infested pine stands on the edge response of
   beetles. The results clearly illustrated a significant positive edge
   response of beetles at the landscape scale. The intensities of
   infestations decreased non-linearly with distances to the nearest
   cutblocks. The results also suggested that the quality and distribution
   of key habitat resources could not fully explain the fundamental
   mechanisms underlying the edge response. The behavioural change of
   beetle dispersal at edges may also be an important factor contributing
   to a positive edge response. The results from this study may be useful
   in improving the efficacy of mountain pine beetle management efforts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a probabilistic approach for mapping and assessment
   of services provided by landscapes, based on variogram modelling and
   geostatistical simulations. Of operational value is that several
   services can be treated and mapped simultaneously, providing an
   efficient tool to model the heterogeneity of different landscape
   components. The methodology was adopted to depict spatial heterogeneity
   of five landscape services in the case study area of Markische Schweiz
   in North East Germany: habitat for species, crop production, visual
   appreciation, water supply, and water regulation. Results, displayed in
   terms of single and joint probability maps, provide new insights about
   the composition and interrelation of multiple services in a region. It
   is shown that each landscape service is characterised by a specific
   spatial pattern, described in terms of heterogeneity and spatial range.
   Setting a probability threshold of service occurrence >0.50, 10\% of the
   area under agricultural land uses provides no landscape services, 35\%
   delivers one service while 25\% and 19\% supply two and three services,
   respectively. The share of agricultural area with a potential joint
   provision of four services equals 10\%, while only 1.4\% of the area has
   a potential to deliver five joint landscape services. The highest mean
   join probability is that observed for the common supply of production
   and habitat services (30\%), highlighting the occurrence of hotspots of
   services provision with possible conflicts due to the on-going
   intensification of agricultural management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Long-term applications of organic amendments, such as pig slurry (PS),
   may represent environmental risk of soil and water pollution by trace
   metals (TM). Our objective was to examine different soil and manure
   management scenarios that enhance the long-term agricultural use of
   soils under repetitive PS applications while avoiding environmental
   risk. Firstly, we developed a new module for simulating the impacts of
   soil tillage frequencies in Hydrus-1D. Secondly, we used a previously
   validated modeling approach to predict the surface accumulation and
   movement of the TM during the next 100-year in the soil under different
   PS doses (80 and 40 m(3) ha(-1) cultivation(-1)) and tillage frequencies
   (no-tillage and 20, 10, and 5-year tillage). No-tillage simulations
   revealed consistent TM surface accumulations, reaching the soil
   threshold value for Cu in the 0-20 cm layer after 86 years of PS
   amendments at high doses, but in layers 0-5, 0-10, and 5-10 cm, this
   concentration was already reached after 17, 38, and 75 years,
   respectively. While soil tillage reduced TM concentrations over the top
   20 cm of the soil profile, it increased their transfer to deeper layers.
   Periodical soil tillage each 5, 10, and 20 years was found to allow PS
   applications without reaching the Cu threshold value in soil during 100
   years. However, soil solution concentrations of Zn reached the threshold
   values for groundwater. Therefore, the best manure management practice
   for the long-term PS disposal with respect to Zn and Cu concentrations
   in soil is the application of moderate PS rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

   management of land and water at a significant scale. The Convention on

   the creation of large numbers of new protected areas. But there is also
   growing criticism of protected areas because of the social costs of
   protection and doubts about their effectiveness. We acknowledge this
   criticism but believe that it is over-stated and applied to a protected
   area model that has already been replaced by newer thinking. As
   protected areas are becoming more complex in concept and more
   complicated in management, we review the six most important changes
   affecting them over the last 2 decades: (1) a new protected area
   definition with more emphasis on nature conservation; (2) a plurality of
   management and governance models; (3) acknowledgement of wider protected
   area benefits beyond nature conservation; (4) greater social safeguards

Abstract = {{Species introductions have the potential to affect the functionality and
   stability of ecological communities, but because little is known about
   how introduced species form novel interactions, these impacts are
   difficult to predict. We quantified the impacts of species introductions
   on species interaction networks using five different model scenarios of
   how a novel species might form plant-pollinator interactions. The
   network structure was based on experimental manipulations on a community
   of plants and pollinators and shows that the community was more diverse,
   ordered, and compartmentalized, but less complex when an invasive plant
   generalist was present. Our models of species introductions reliably
   predicted several aspects of novel network structure in the field study.
   We found that introduced species that become incorporated into the
   community as generalists (both in the number and frequency of their
   interactions) have a much larger impact on the structure of
   plant-pollinator communities than introduced species that integrate into
   the community with few interactions. Average degree is strongly affected
   by the number of interactions the novel species forms and whether it
   competes for interactions, whereas connectance is affected by whether
   the novel species competes for interactions or adds new interaction
   partners. The number and size of compartments in the network change only
   when the novel species adds new interaction partners, while modularity
   and nestedness respond most to the number of interactions formed by the
   novel species. We provide a new approach for understanding the impacts
   of introduced and invasive species on plant-pollinator communities and
   demonstrate that it is critical to evaluate multiple structural
   characters simultaneously, as large changes in the fundamental structure
   of the community may be disguised.}},

Abstract = {{Biologists have long sought to understand the processes underlying

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Aim Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) often involve some
   degree of projection into novel covariate space (i.e. extrapolation),
   because calibration data may not encompass the entire space of interest.
   Most methods for identifying extrapolation focus on the range of each
   model covariate individually. However, extrapolation can occur that is
   well within the range of univariate variation, but which exhibits novel
   combinations between covariates. Our objective was to develop a tool
   that can detect, distinguish and quantify these two types of novelties:
   novel univariate range and novel combinations of covariates.
   Location Global, Australia, South Africa.
   Methods We developed a new multivariate statistical tool, based on the
   Mahalanobis distance, which measures the similarity between the
   reference and projection domains by accounting for both the deviation
   from the mean and the correlation between variables. The method also
   provides an assessment tool for the detection of the most influential
   covariates leading to dissimilarity. As an example application, we
   modelled an Australian shrub (Acacia cyclops) widely introduced to other
   countries and compared reference data, global distribution data and both
   types of model extrapolation against the projection globally and in
   South Africa.
   Results The new tool successfully detected and quantified the degree of
   dissimilarity for points that were either outside the univariate range
   or formed novel covariate combinations (correlations) but were still
   within the univariate range of covariates. For A. cyclops, more than
   half of the points (6617 of 10,785) from the global projection space
   that were found to lie within the univariate range of reference data
   exhibited distorted correlations. Not all the climate covariates used
   for modelling contributed to novelty equally over the geographical space
   of the model projection.
   Main conclusions Identifying non-analogous environments is a critical
   component of model interrogation. Our extrapolation detection (ExDet)
   tool can be used as a quantitative method for exploring novelty and
   interpreting the projections from correlative SDMs and is available for

Abstract = {{With ongoing global change, there is an urgent need to expand existing
   networks of important conservation areas around the world. In the
   western United States, vast areas of public land, including those
   administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), present substantial
   conservation opportunities. For 11 contiguous western states, we used a
   novel multiple-criteria analysis to model and map contiguous areas of
   roadless BLM land that possessed important ecological indicators of high
   biodiversity, resilience to climate change, and landscape connectivity.
   Specifically, we leveraged available spatial datasets to implement a
   systematic and statistically robust analysis of seven key indicators at
   three different spatial scales, and to identify the locations of
   potential conservation priority areas (CPAs) across 294,274 km(2) of
   roadless BLM land. Within this extent, and based on conservative
   thresholds in our results, we identified 43,417 km(2) of land with
   relatively high conservation value and 117 unique CPAs totaling 6291
   km(2). Most CPA lands were located in Utah, Colorado, Arizona, Oregon,
   and Nevada. Overall, CPAs had higher species richness, vegetation
   community diversity, topographic complexity, and surface water
   availability than existing BLM protected areas. CPAs often corresponded
   with locations known to have important wilderness characteristics or
   were adjacent to established areas of ecological, social, or cultural
   importance. These CPAs represent a diverse set of places that can be
   used by multiple stakeholders in ongoing or future landscape
   conservation and special designation efforts in BLM and adjacent
   ownerships. Our methodological framework and novel weighting approach
   can accommodate a wide range of input variables and is readily
   applicable to other jurisdictions and regions within the U.S. and

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Urban runoff can impact the thermal regime of surface waters and degrade
   valuable aquatic ecosystems. Some stormwater control measures (SCMs)
   have been shown to mitigate the effects of thermallyenriched runoff, but
   previous studies lacked consistency when characterizing the thermal
   behavior of SCMs. Ecologically-relevant parameters such as maximum
   outflow temperature, duration of temperatures exceeding thresholds for
   coldwater species, and thermal load have all been considered in past
   research. Standard metrics that properly represent the downstream
   impacts of urban stormwater were needed. This paper evaluated thermal
   metrics to provide designers and regulators with catchment-scale methods
   for assessing thermal performance and compliance. It was concluded that
   multiple metrics must be employed to account for both thermal load and
   biologically-based reference temperature limits. Metrics for temperature
   evaluations were broken out by data requirements. When only SCM
   temperature data are available, event mean temperature estimation
   appears to be the most rigorous metric. Groundwater temperature may also
   be employed as a surrogate metric for SCM discharge temperatures if
   conservative protection of coldwater stream health is desired. When SCM
   temperature and flow data exist, thermal load reductions should be
   explored.
   Efficacy of the low impact development (LID) strategy for temperature
   mitigation (retaining onsite greater than the 95th percentile storm
   event) was evaluated using field-collected permeable pavement data.
   Based on these data, retaining the 95th percentile storm event was
   determined to be an effective technique for thermal protection of
   surface waters.
   However, the most rigorous metrics involve long-term temperature and
   flow data from local reference streams. The best metric currently
   available is the uniform continuous above threshold (UCAT) method, in
   which it is necessary to consider continuous exposure duration when
   comparing against biological thresholds. These analyses can be tailored
   to specific species of interest within a targeted ecoregion. Combined
   with thermal load and mixing analysis in-stream, the UCAT method can
   provide a real-world estimation of the impacts of development.
   Additionally, evaluation of mixing zones in-stream should also be
   employed to adequately assess thermal impacts. However, these methods
   are the most data intensive.
   The metrics discussed in this paper can be used to inform new and
   existing design methodologies for regulating stormwater temperature,
   duration, and thermal load. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   2. The Nature Conservancy's initial scientific innovation was the use of
   distributional data for rare species and ecological communities to
   systematically target lands for conservation. This innovation later
   evolved into a more rigorous approach known as `Conservation by Design'
   that contained elements of systematic conservation planning, strategic
   planning and monitoring and evaluation.
   3. The next scientific transition at TNC was a move to landscape-scale
   projects, motivated by ideas from landscape ecology. Because the scale
   at which land could be set aside in areas untouched by humans fell far
   short of the spatial scale demanded by conservation, TNC became involved
   with best management practices for forestry, grazing, agriculture,
   hydropower and other land uses.
   4. A third scientific innovation at TNC came with the pursuit of
   multiobjective planning that accounts for economic and resource needs in
   the same plans that seek to protect biodiversity.
   5. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment prompted TNC to become
   increasingly concerned with ecosystem services and the material risk to
   people posed by ecosystem deterioration.
   6. Finally, because conservation depends heavily upon negotiation, TNC
   has recently recruited social scientists, economists and communication
   experts. One aspect still missing, however, is a solid scientific
   understanding of thresholds that should be averted.
   7. Synthesis and applications. Over its 60-plus year history, scientific
   advances have informed The Nature Conservancy (TNC)'s actions and
   strategies, and in turn the evolving practice of conservation has
   altered the type of science sought by TNC in order to maximize its
   conservation effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{The term ``environmental flows{''} describes the quantities, quality,
   and patterns of water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine
   ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide. Environmental flows
   may be achieved in a number of different ways, most of which are based
   on either (1) limiting alterations from the natural flow baseline to
   maintain biodiversity and ecological integrity or (2) designing flow
   regimes to achieve specific ecological and ecosystem service outcomes.
   We argue that the former practice is more applicable to natural and
   semi-natural rivers where the primary objective and opportunity is
   ecological conservation. The latter ``designer{''} approach is better
   suited to modified and managed rivers where return to natural conditions
   is no longer feasible and the objective is to maximize natural capital
   as well as support economic growth, recreation, or cultural history.
   This permits elements of ecosystem design and adaptation to
   environmental change. In a future characterized by altered climates and
   intensive regulation, where hybrid and novel aquatic ecosystems
   predominate, the designer approach may be the only feasible option. This
   conclusion stems from a lack of natural ecosystems from which to draw
   analogs and the need to support broader socioeconomic benefits and
   valuable configurations of natural and social capital.}},

Abstract = {{The collective behavior of ants and the emergence of self-organizing
   patterns in ant colonies have been explained with various theoretical
   approaches based on models of trail following behavior elicited by
   pheromones. Although existing models can explain collective behavior of
   ants, there is little empirical evidence on how ants precisely respond
   to various pheromone concentrations. Thus, important knowledge is
   lacking about how much realistic description of ant behavior can be
   provided by the models and their underlying mathematical functions. To
   fill in this gap, we conducted experiments with three different ant
   species to explore their responses to varying concentrations of
   pheromones that elicit ants' trail following behavior. We found that
   ants' decision making processes in trail following are best explained by
   psychophysical theory (PT), which describes the relationship between
   physical stimuli, sensory perception and decision making in humans,
   other primates, birds and insects. Furthermore, the theory provides
   clear definitions of biological parameters, such as detection- and
   discrimination thresholds. The species studied were distinctively
   different in the shape and parameters of their psychometric functions,
   which we attribute to specific adaptions to their environment. The
   observed differences are discussed in relation to their natural trail
   following behaviors. Our study opens a new perspective of understanding
   and explaining important aspects of collective ant behavior using a
   well-established theory of perception.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the spatial and temporal distribution of terrestrial gross
   primary production (GPP) is a critical step in closing the Earth's
   carbon budget. Dynamical global vegetation models (DGVMs) provide
   mechanistic insight into GPP variability but diverge in predicting the
   response to climate in poorly investigated regions. Recent advances in
   the remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) opens
   up a new possibility to provide direct global observational constraints
   for GPP. Here, we apply an optimal estimation approach to infer the
   global distribution of GPP from an ensemble of eight DGVMs constrained
   by global measurements of SIF from the Greenhouse Gases Observing
   SATellite (GOSAT). These estimates are compared to flux tower data in N.
   America, Europe, and tropical S. America, with careful consideration of
   scale differences between models, GOSAT, and flux towers. Assimilation
   of GOSAT SIF with DGVMs causes a redistribution of global productivity
   from northern latitudes to the tropics of 7-8PgCyr(-1) from 2010 to
   2012, with reduced GPP in northern forests (similar to 3.6PgCyr(-1)) and
   enhanced GPP in tropical forests (similar to 3.7PgCyr(-1)). This leads
   to improvements in the structure of the seasonal cycle, including
   earlier dry season GPP loss and enhanced peak-to-trough GPP in tropical
   forests within the Amazon Basin and reduced growing season length in
   northern croplands and deciduous forests. Uncertainty in predicted GPP
   (estimated from the spread of DGVMs) is reduced by 40-70\% during peak
   productivity suggesting the assimilation of GOSAT SIF with models is
   well-suited for benchmarking. We conclude that satellite fluorescence
   augurs a new opportunity to quantify the GPP response to climate drivers
   and the potential to constrain predictions of carbon cycle evolution.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1347-1360}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The challenge of incorporating the concept of ecosystem services in
   landscape planning has been widely acknowledged, yet values of ecosystem
   services are not well considered in current landscape planning and
   environmental governance. This is particularly the case when local
   stakeholders are strongly involved in decision making about adapting the
   landscape to future demands and challenges. Engagement of stakeholders
   introduces a variety of interests and motives that result in diverging
   value interpretations. Moreover, participative planning approaches are
   based on learning processes, implying that the perceptions of value
   evolve during the planning process. Current valuation approaches are not
   able to support such process. Therefore we argue that there is a need
   for a novel view on the mechanism of integrating valuation in the
   different stages of community-based landscape planning, as well as for
   tools based on this mechanism. By revisiting the original conception of
   ecosystem services and redefining the value of an ecosystem service as
   its comparative importance to human wellbeing, we develop a conceptual
   framework for incorporating ecosystem service valuation that captures
   the full spectrum of value and value changes. We acknowledge that in the
   social interactions during the planning process values are redefined,
   negotiated and reframed in the context of the local landscape.
   Therefore, we propose a valuation mechanism that evolves through the
   phases of the cyclic planning process. We illustrate the use of this
   mechanism by proposing a tool that supports stakeholder groups in
   building a value-based vision on landscape adaptation that contributes
   to all wellbeing dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Large hydropower schemes have recently gained renewed interest as a
   provider of efficient and renewable energy, particularly in developing
   countries. However, some dams may have widespread effects on
   hydrological and ecosystem integrity, which reach beyond the scales
   addressed by typical environmental impact assessments. In this paper we
   address two main ecological impacts-reduced river connectivity and
   changes in the natural flow regime-at the scale of the entire Mekong
   River Basin as an important component of dam evaluations. The goal is to
   improve our understanding of the effect of individual dams as well as
   clusters of dams at a very large scale. We introduce two new indices,
   the River Connectivity Index (RCI) as a tool to measure network
   connectivity, and the River Regulation Index (RRI) as a measure of flow
   alteration, and calculate the individual and cumulative impact of 81
   proposed dams using HydroROUT, a graph-theory based river routing model.
   Furthermore, we demonstrate how quantitative weighting, e.g. based on
   river habitat characterizations or species distribution models, may be
   included in dam impact assessments.
   A global comparison of large rivers shows that the Mekong would
   experience strong deterioration in the fragmentation and flow regulation
   indices if all dams that are currently under consideration in the basin
   were built, placing it among other heavily impounded rivers in the
   world. The results illustrate the importance of considering the location
   of dams, both relative in the network and relative to other already
   existing dams. Our approach may be used as an index-based ranking system
   for individual dams, or to compare basin-wide development scenarios,
   with the goal of providing guidance for decision makers wishing to
   select locations for future dams with less environmental impacts and to
   identify and develop potential mitigation strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Successful recovery of populations of rare and cryptic species requires
   accurate monitoring of changes in their distribution and densities,
   which in turn necessitates considering detection rates. Development of
   population monitoring protocols is needed to aid recovery of the New
   England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis; currently the
   top-priority Species of Greatest Conservation Need in the northeastern
   United States), which lives in dense shrubby habitat and is difficult to
   detect. To address this need, we conducted repeated, systematic,
   presence-absence surveys to determine patch-specific detection
   probabilities and factors influencing detection of the New England
   cottontail. We surveyed cottontails during 2-6 visits on 30 sites with
   known occupancy in the northeastern United States during the winters of
   2010 and 2011. For each survey visit, we determined whether cottontails
   were detected by the presence of fecal pellets on fresh fallen snow and
   subsequent species identification by genetic analysis. Detection
   probabilities were modeled in Program PRESENCE to explore the influence
   of snow condition and depth, temperature, wind, number of pellet
   deposition days, woody stem density, patch size, and search effort. The
   overall probability of detecting a New England cottontail during a
   single survey visit was 0.73. The most influential factor in detection
   was prior knowledge of site-specific cottontail activity. Snow depth
   <30.5 cm and the number of days without high winds following a snowfall
   had a positive influence on detection. Patch size had a negative effect
   on detection when surveys were restricted to 20 minutes. In the absence
   of prior knowledge, 2-3 surveys conducted with snowpack < 30.5 cm and
   2-4 days after a snowfall without high wind should yield reliable
   occupancy status with 95\% confidence in detection. Incorporating our
   recommendations into monitoring programs will improve the accuracy of
   patch-specific occupancy data for New England cottontail. Our approach
   and findings may be applicable to monitoring other rare, cryptic, or
   threatened species that occupy dense habitats, especially where
   patch-level occupancy knowledge is required. (C) 2014 The Wildlife

Abstract = {{Wild populations of Atlantic salmon have declined worldwide. While the
   causes for this decline may be complex and numerous, increased mortality
   at sea is predicted to be one of the major contributing factors.
   Examining the potential changes occurring in the genome-wide composition
   of populations during this migration has the potential to tease apart
   some of the factors influencing marine mortality. Here, we genotyped
   5568 SNPs in Atlantic salmon populations representing two distinct
   regional genetic groups and across two cohorts to test for differential
   allelic and genotypic frequencies between juveniles (smolts) migrating
   to sea and adults (grilses) returning to freshwater after 1 year at sea.
   Given the complexity of the traits potentially associated with sea
   mortality, we contrasted the outcomes of a single-locus FST based genome
   scan method with a new multilocus framework to test for genetically
   based differential mortality at sea. While numerous outliers were
   identified by the single-locus analysis, no evidence for parallel,
   temporally repeated selection was found. In contrast, the multilocus
   approach detected repeated patterns of selection for a multilocus group
   of 34 covarying SNPs in one of the two populations. No significant
   pattern of selective mortality was detected in the other population,
   suggesting different causes of mortality among populations. These
   results first support the hypothesis that selection mainly causes small
   changes in allele frequencies among many covarying loci rather than a
   small number of changes in loci with large effects. They also point out
   that moving away from the a strict `selective sweep paradigm' towards a
   multilocus genetics framework may be a more useful approach for studying
   the genomic signatures of natural selection on complex traits in wild
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Sphagnum-dominated bogs represent a unique yet widely distributed type
   of terrestrial ecosystem and strongly contribute to global biosphere
   functioning. Sphagnum is colonized by highly diverse microbial
   communities, but less is known about their function. We identified a
   high functional diversity within the Sphagnum microbiome applying an
   Illumina-based metagenomic approach followed by de novo assembly and
   MG-RAST annotation. An interenvironmental comparison revealed that the
   Sphagnum microbiome harbours specific genetic features that distinguish
   it significantly from microbiomes of higher plants and peat soils. The
   differential traits especially support ecosystem functioning by a
   symbiotic lifestyle under poikilohydric and ombrotrophic conditions. To
   realise a plasticity-stability balance, we found abundant subsystems
   responsible to cope with oxidative and drought stresses, to exchange
   (mobile) genetic elements, and genes that encode for resistance to
   detrimental environmental factors, repair and self-controlling
   mechanisms. Multiple microbe-microbe and plant-microbe interactions were
   also found to play a crucial role as indicated by diverse genes
   necessary for biofilm formation, interaction via quorum sensing and
   nutrient exchange. A high proportion of genes involved in nitrogen cycle
   and recycling of organic material supported the role of bacteria for
   nutrient supply. 16S rDNA analysis indicated a higher structural
   diversity than that which had been previously detected using
   PCR-dependent techniques. Altogether, the diverse Sphagnum microbiome
   has the ability to support the life of the host plant and the entire
   ecosystem under changing environmental conditions. Beyond this, the moss
   microbiome presents a promising bio-resource for environmental

Abstract = {{An important characteristic of many wetland plants in semi-arid regions
   is their capacity to withstand fluctuations between extended dry phases
   and floods. However, anthropogenic river regulation can reduce natural
   flow variability in riverine wetlands, causing a decline in the
   frequency and duration of deep flooding as well as extended droughts,
   and an increase in shallow flooding and soil saturation. Our aim in this
   paper was to use an experimental approach to examine whether reductions
   in flooding and drought disadvantage species adapted to both these
   extremes, and favours those with water requirements that match the new
   regime of frequent low-level flooding. We compared the growth
   characteristics and biomass allocation of three native Australian
   aquatic macrophytes (Pseudoraphis spinescens, Juncus ingens and Typha
   domingensis), which co-occur at Barmah Forest, south-eastern Australia,
   under three water treatments: drought, soil saturation and deep
   flooding. The responses of species to the treatments largely reflected
   changes in their relative abundance at Barmah Forest since river
   regulation. Typha domingensis, which has remained uncommon, performed
   relatively poorly in all treatments, while J. ingens, which has
   increased its range, exhibited more vigorous growth under soil
   saturation. Pseudoraphis spinescens, which was once widespread but has
   declined markedly in its distribution, grew strongly under all water
   treatments. These findings suggest that a return to more natural,
   variable river flow regimes can potentially be an important conservation
   and restoration strategy in ecosystems characterised by species that
   have adaptations to extreme hydrological growing conditions.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that as a consequence of climate change the
   frequency of extreme hydrological events will increase. Predicting the
   impacts of these extreme events on ecological systems is a major
   research challenge. It is predicted that change in future river flows,
   characterised by greater occurrence of floods and droughts, will have
   profound impacts on aquatic invertebrate communities by removing
   sensitive species and restructuring food networks. However, it remains
   unclear how an increase in these hydrological extremes will impact on
   riparian communities and species at higher trophic levels. Here, we
   describe a new methodology that facilitates the integration of
   quantitative outputs of species' distribution models with the expert
   knowledge of conservation practitioners to produce a species'
   vulnerability index (SVI). Using our SVI framework, we assessed and
   ranked the vulnerability of 16 river bird species to a potential
   climate-induced shift in the frequency, duration and magnitude of flood
   and drought events. Vulnerability was associated primarily with
   ecological traits that restrict species to in-channel riverine habitat.
   Whilst the SVI was developed to assess species' vulnerability to
   hydrological extremes on rivers, it is equally applicable to other
   environmental domains as well as a range of avian and non-avian taxa.
   Furthermore, this original methodological approach provides researchers
   and managers with a valuable conservation tool that allows them to
   identify the species most vulnerable to climate change impacts and plan
   mitigation and adaptation strategies. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Low-temperature growth limitation largely determines alpine treeline
   position globally, but treeline elevation also varies locally at a range
   of scales in response to multiple biotic and abiotic factors. In this
   study, we conceptualise how variability in treeline elevation is related
   to abiotic factors that act as thermal modifiers, physiological
   stressors, or disturbance agents. We then present a novel analytical
   framework for quantifying how abiotic factors influence treeline
   elevation at different spatial scales using New Zealand Nothofagus
   treelines as a case study. We delineated Nothofagus treelines in a GIS,
   along which we extracted data for treeline elevation and eight abiotic
   explanatory variables at 54 000 points. Each location was classified at
   each of five spatial scales based on nested river catchments, ranging
   from large regional to small hillslope catchments. We used hierarchical
   linear models to partition the variation in both treeline elevation and
   the eight abiotic variables by spatial scale, and then quantified the
   relationships between these at each spatial scale in turn. Nothofagus
   treeline elevation varied from 800-1740 ma.s.l. across New Zealand.
   Abiotic factors explained 82\% of the variation in treeline elevation at
   the largest (regional) scale and 44-52\% of variation at the four finer
   scales. Broad-scale variation in Nothofagus treeline elevation was
   strongly associated with thermal modifiers, consistent with the idea
   that treelines coincide with a temperature-driven, physiological limit.
   However, much of the finer-scale variation in treeline elevation was
   explained by a combination of thermal, physiological stress-related, and
   disturbance variables operating at different spatial scales. The
   conceptual model and analytical methods developed here provide a general
   framework for understanding treeline variation at different spatial
   scales.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing biologically relevant stream disturbance regimes is
   challenging, but necessary to answer questions about disturbance effects
   on ecological processes. No universally accepted approach exists for
   characterizing stream disturbance regimes. Our goal was to evaluate
   approaches that can be applied to test effects of disturbance on benthic
   organisms. We defined disturbance as events or environmental conditions
   caused by changes in stream discharge that affect the stability or
   habitability of the stream bed. We used several metrics to describe
   disturbance regimes of mountain streams that were not permanently gauged
   in 1 catchment, and considered the trade-off between effort required to
   obtain the data and the quality of information gained. We used an
   innovative photographic method to assess substrate particle movement
   empirically as a benchmark for comparison to other indicators of channel
   stability and to metrics describing hydrologic variability relevant to
   streambed stability. We used a model selection procedure to choose the
   best combination of individual variables to explain variation in
   substrate particle movement and included those variables in a
   multivariate axis of disturbance that can be applied to evaluate effects
   of disturbance on benthic organisms. Individual variables with the
   highest explanatory power were maximum daily increase in discharge and
   the Pfankuch index of channel stability. Substrate particle size and
   stream size (drainage basin area) were related to the multivariate index
   of disturbance, but channel gradient was not. Protocols used to measure
   substrate stability and to obtain the multivariate index of disturbance
   were labor intensive, but our analyses indicate it may be reasonable to
   use more easily measured variables (e.g., Pfankuch index) to estimate
   disturbance to benthic organisms at local scales, although explanatory
   power may be reduced. Our analyses provide a menu of options to estimate
   variation in local disturbance regimes of ungauged mountain streams that
   may not be adequately explained by extrapolation from hydrographs of
   gauged streams.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies have attempted to identify the major environmental factors
   responsible for elevational variations in species richness. Such studies
   have been mainly performed in temperate and tropical areas, whereas the
   mediterranean biome has been substantially neglected. The aim of this
   paper was to disentangle the effects of available area, mid-domain
   constraints, and the environmental tolerance of species, on the
   altitudinal distribution of tenebrionid beetles in a Mediterranean
   region. A comprehensive faunistic database was used to assess the
   elevational distribution of tenebrionids in Latium (Central Italy).
   Variations in species richness, beta diversity and nestedness were
   analysed in association with variation in species ranges and midpoints.
   Variation in species richness was contrasted with patterns expected on
   the basis of the mid domain effect (MDE) and available surface area.
   After correcting for differences in area availability due to the conical
   shape of mountains, an unexpected triphasic pattern emerged: (1) at low
   altitudes, species richness was higher than expected on the basis of the
   effect of area and the MDE; (2) at around 800 m elevation, there is an
   abrupt change in species assemblages, and richness values fit those
   predicted by the MDE; (3) a new dramatic change occurred at 1,700 m,
   with tenebrionid assemblages composed of a small number of mainly
   eurytopic species. The integrated approach used in this study
   demonstrates that neither MDE nor monotonic patterns fully explain the
   observed diversity patterns. Variations in species ranges indicate that
   the elevational gradient filters species according to their ecological
   tolerance.}},

   forests affected by the hemlock woolly adelgid}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The abundance of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) in eastern US
   forests has declined since the 1950s owing to the introduction of the
   non-native insect, hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA, Adelges tsugae). In
   southern New England, eastern hemlock is being replaced by the deciduous
   tree species, black birch (Betula lenta). To date there is little
   understanding of whether hemlock loss will fundamentally alter ecosystem
   C balance and component fluxes. In this study, we use a comparative
   approach to study potential changes in C fluxes and N cycling associated
   with HWA-induced hemlock decline and replacement. The stands include
   primary-and secondary-growth hemlock forests (>230 and 132 years old,
   respectively), recently disturbed stands (5 and 18 years old) that now
   have rapidly growing black birch saplings, and a mature black birch
   stand of age similar to the second-growth hemlock stand. We found that
   aboveground net primary production was higher in the aggrading black
   birch stand and significantly so at 18-years post-HWA compared to the
   secondary-hemlock stand it would likely replace. Rapid forest regrowth
   was accompanied by significantly higher rates of N uptake from the soil
   but also higher N-use efficiency because most of the N taken up from the
   soil was allocated to the production of wood with a high C-to-N ratio.
   In contrast to patterns of aboveground production, the rate of soil
   respiration was lowest in the young stands and not significantly
   different from the second-growth hemlock stand, suggesting little net
   effect of stand replacement on soil C efflux. The leaf litter
   decomposition study showed that black birch litter decomposed more
   rapidly than hemlock litter but that there was no effect of stand type
   on the rate of decomposition. Analyses of extracellular microbial
   exoenzyme activity painted a more nuanced pattern of variation among
   stands, with fine root biomass the only weakly explanatory variable. In
   combination with our prior work on C stocks, these results suggest that
   forests affected by HWA in southern New England will remain a sink for
   atmospheric CO2 despite reorganization of stand structure and species
   composition.}},

Abstract = {{1. Habitat loss and degradation, overexploitation, climate change and
   the spread of invasive species are drastically depleting the Earth's
   biological diversity, leading to detrimental impacts on ecosystem
   services and human well-being.
   2. Our ability to monitor the state of biodiversity and the impacts of
   global environmental change on this natural capital is fundamental to
   designing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies for preventing
   further loss of biological diversity. This requires the scientific
   community to assess spatio-temporal changes in the distribution of
   abiotic conditions (e. g. temperature, rainfall) and in the
   distribution, structure, composition and functioning of ecosystems.
   3. The potential for satellite remote sensing (SRS) to provide key data
   has been highlighted by many researchers, with SRS offering repeatable,
   standardized and verifiable information on long-term trends in
   biodiversity indicators. SRS permits one to address questions on scales
   inaccessible to ground-based methods alone, facilitating the development
   of an integrated approach to natural resource management, where
   biodiversity, pressures to biodiversity and consequences of management
   decisions can all be monitored.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Here, we provide an interdisciplinary
   perspective on the prospects of satellite remote sensing (SRS) for
   ecological applications, reviewing established avenues and highlighting
   new research and technological developments that have a high potential
   to make a difference in environmental management. We also discuss
   current barriers to the ecological application of SRS-based approaches
   and identify possible ways to overcome some of these limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Species colonization in a new habitat patch is an efficiency indicator
   of biodiversity conservation. Colonization is a two-step process of
   dispersal and establishment, characterized by the compatibility of plant
   traits with landscape structure and habitat conditions. Therefore,
   ecological trait profiling of specialist species is initially required
   to estimate the relative importance of colonization filters. Old planted
   parks best satisfy the criteria of a newly created and structurally
   matured habitat for forest-dwelling plant species. We sampled species in
   230 ancient deciduous forests (source habitat), 74 closed-canopy manor
   parks (target habitats), 151 linear wooded habitats (landscape
   corridors), and 97 open habitats (isolating matrix) in Estonia. We
   defined two species groups of interest: forest (107 species) and
   corridor specialists (53 species). An extra group of open habitat
   specialists was extracted for trait scaling. Differing from
   expectations, forest specialists have high plasticity in reproduction
   mechanisms: smaller seeds, larger dispersules, complementary selfing
   ability, and diversity of dispersal vectors. Forest specialists are
   shorter, less nutrient-demanding and mycorrhizal-dependent,
   stress-tolerant disturbance-sensitive competitors, while corridor
   specialists are large-seeded disturbance-tolerant competitors. About
   40\% of species from local species pools have immigrated into parks. The
   historic forest area, establishment-related traits, and stand quality
   enhance the colonization of forest specialists. The openness of
   landscape and mowing in the park facilitate corridor specialists.
   Species traits in parks vary between a forest and corridor specialist,
   except for earlier flowering and larger propagules. Forest species are
   not dispersal limited, but they continue to be limited by habitat
   properties even in the long term. Therefore, the shady parts of historic
   parks should be appreciated as important forest biodiversity-enhancing
   landscape structures. The habitat quality of secondary stands can be
   improved by nurturing a heterogeneous shrub and tree layer, and modest
   herb layer management.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{1. Species' abundances vary in space and time. Describing these patterns
   is a cornerstone of macroecology. Moreover, trends in population size
   are an important criterion for the assessment of a species' conservation
   status. Because abundance trends are not homogeneous in space, we need
   to quantify variation in abundance trends across the geographical range
   of a species. A basic difficulty exists in that data sets that cover
   large geographic areas rarely include population abundance data at high
   temporal resolution. Whilst both broad-scale geographic distribution
   data and site-specific population trend data are becoming more widely
   available, approaches are required which integrate these different types
   of data.
   2. We present a hierarchical model that integrates observations from
   multiple sources to estimate spatio-temporal abundance trends. The model
   links annual population densities on a spatial grid to both long-term
   count data and to opportunistic occurrence records from a citizen
   science programme. Specific observation models for both data types
   explicitly account for differences in data structure and quality.
   3. We test this novel method in a virtual study with simulated data and
   apply it to the estimation of abundance dynamics across the range of a
   butterfly species (Pyronia tithonus) in Great Britain between 1985 and
   2004. The application to simulated and real data demonstrates how the
   hierarchical model structure accommodates various sources of uncertainty
   which occur at different stages of the link between observational data
   and the modelled abundance, thereby it accounts for these uncertainties
   in the inference of abundance variations.
   4. We show that by using hierarchical observation models that integrate
   different types of commonly available data sources, we can improve the
   estimates of variation in species abundances across space and time. This
   will improve our ability to detect regional trends and can also enhance
   the empirical basis for understanding range dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{1. Ecological and environmental gradients create varying selective
   pressures on organisms that result in differences in optimal life
   history tactics. Moreover, life histories are inherently multivariate,
   consisting of a coordinated suite of life history traits that vary over
   an organism's lifetime. Such variation can be described as a trajectory
   of phenotypic change through time inmultivariate space defined by a set
   of life history traits.
   2. We demonstrate the use of phenotypic trajectory analysis as a
   multivariate analytical approach for quantifying and comparing
   phenotypic change in life history throughout an organism's life. Life
   history trajectories have attributes - magnitude, direction, and shape -
   that can be quantified and statistically compared. We demonstrate the
   construction of trajectories using levels characterized by individuals
   with the same age or similar state, and we show how this approach can be
   used to evaluate the evolution of life history strategies given
   predictions from life history theory.
   3. We demonstrate the utility of phenotypic trajectory analysis for life
   histories using two examples. We compare life history trajectories of
   burying beetles and show that females balance costs of reproduction
   differently based on resource availability. We also characterize life
   history trajectories of livebearing fish in different predation
   environments. We show that females in non-predator environments, but not
   predator environments, exhibit trajectories consistent with the terminal
   investment hypothesis.
   4. While analysing life history variation in a multivariate framework is
   not novel, we show that phenotypic trajectory analysis provides a method
   to statistically test age-and state-based predictions of life history
   theory.}},

Abstract = {{In recent times, network theory has become a useful tool to study the
   structure of the interactions in ecological communities. However,
   typically, these approaches focus on a particular kind of interaction
   while neglecting other possible interactions present in the ecosystem.
   Here, we present an ecological network for plant communities that
   consider simultaneously positive and negative interactions, which were
   derived from the spatial association and segregation between plant
   species. We employed this network to study the structure and the
   association strategies in a semiarid plant community of Cabo de
   Gata-Nijar Natural Park, SE Spain, and how they changed in 4 sites that
   differed in stocking rate. Association strategies were obtained from the
   partitions of the network, built based on a relaxed structural balance
   criterion. We found that grazing simplified the structure of the plant
   community. With increasing stocking rate species with no significant
   associations became dominant and the number of partitions decreased in
   the plant community. Independently of stocking rate, many species
   presented an associative strategy in the plant community because they
   benefit from the association to certain `nurse' plants. These `nurses'
   together with species that developed a segregating strategy, intervened
   in most of the interactions in the community. Ecological networks that
   combine links with different signs provide a new insight to analyze the
   structure of natural communities and identify the species which play a
   central role in them. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The genotyping of highly polymorphic multigene families across many
   individuals used to be a particularly challenging task because of
   methodological limitations associated with traditional approaches.
   Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can overcome most of these limitations,
   and it is increasingly being applied in population genetic studies of
   multigene families. Here, we critically review NGS bioinformatic
   approaches that have been used to genotype the major histocompatibility
   complex (MHC) immune genes, and we discuss how the significant advances
   made in this field are applicable to population genetic studies of gene
   families. Increasingly, approaches are introduced that apply thresholds
   of sequencing depth and sequence similarity to separate alleles from
   methodological artefacts. We explain why these approaches are
   particularly sensitive to methodological biases by violating fundamental
   genotyping assumptions. An alternative strategy that utilizes ultra-deep
   sequencing (hundreds to thousands of sequences per amplicon) to
   reconstruct genotypes and applies statistical methods on the sequencing
   depth to separate alleles from artefacts appears to be more robust.
   Importantly, the degree of change' (DOC) method avoids using arbitrary
   cut-off thresholds by looking for statistical boundaries between the
   sequencing depth for alleles and artefacts, and hence, it is entirely
   repeatable across studies. Although the advances made in generating NGS
   data are still far ahead of our ability to perform reliable processing,
   analysis and interpretation, the community is developing statistically
   rigorous protocols that will allow us to address novel questions in
   evolution, ecology and genetics of multigene families. Future
   developments in third-generation single molecule sequencing may
   potentially help overcome problems that still persist in de novo
   multigene amplicon genotyping when using current second-generation

Abstract = {{New Zealand pioneered marine reserves, areas in the sea protected from
   all direct human interference. The first reserve was proposed in 1965
   and established in 1977. It has operated successfully ever since. Even
   one instance proves that such things are possible.
   All marine reserves in NZ were initially greeted by a range of
   objections, and widespread and often loud opposition, This is not
   surprising since marine reserves prohibit many existing activities and
   seriously challenge many general opinions. Such opposition is to be
   expected.
   Successful establishment of marine reserves in the first stage was only
   possible when the proponents were very persistent and had community
   support. It helped if they could take advantage of some special local
   circumstance e.g. an adjacent marine laboratory (Leigh), spectacular
   underwater scenery (Poor Knights), unique biogeography (Kermadecs),
   cultural significance (Mayor Island), or severe fishery problems (Long
   Bay).
   Careful examination of the objections to marine reserves showed that
   they were mostly based on misconceptions or misinformation, and can be
   successfully countered in the public mind by answers based on common
   sense arguments or well-established facts. Developing these answers, and
   testing them in the public arena, proved surprisingly useful in both
   scientific theory and practical politics.
   When marine reserves were established, their ecology began to change,
   due to the cessation of fishing and other previous manipulations. These
   changes were complex, often large and continued to develop for decades.
   The study of these changes, and a continuing comparison to fished areas
   provided a great deal of new scientific data showing how fishing
   directly and indirectly alters ecosystems.
   The scientific benefits of marine reserves proved so numerous that it
   became clear that marine reserves are as important to science as clean
   apparatus is to chemistry, and for the same reason. They are the
   controls for the uncontrolled experiment that is happening due to
   fishing and other human activities.
   The general benefits of marine reserves to society as a whole; directly
   to conservation, education, recreation and management, and indirectly to
   fisheries, tourism and coastal planning; are so important that a
   systematic approach to their creation is in the public interest.
   The experience with existing marine reserves (35 to date) is sufficient
   to state the principles needed for such systems: representation and
   Replication (of habitats and species); a geographically widespread
   network; and a total area sufficient to be self-sustaining.
   Most of the lessons from New Zealand are based on fundamental human and
   ecological factors and would be applicable world-wide. Other regions
   could by-pass the long struggle that occurred in New Zealand and move
   directly to creating marine reserve network systems based on our
   experiences and these principles. This has already started to happen in
   Australia and the USA. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{373-410}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In many desert ecosystems, vegetation is both patchy and dynamic:
   vegetated areas are interspersed with patches of bare ground, and both
   the positioning and the species composition of the vegetated areas
   exhibit change through time. These characteristics lead to the emergence
   of multi-scale patterns in vegetation that arise from complex
   relationships between plants, soils, and transport processes. Previous
   attempts to probe the causes of spatial complexity and predict responses
   of desert ecosystems tend to be limited in their focus: models of
   dynamics have been developed with no consideration of the inherent
   patchiness in the vegetation, or else models have been developed to
   generate patterns with no consideration of the dynamics. Here we develop
   a general modelling framework for the analysis of ecosystem change in
   deserts that is rooted in the concept of connectivity and is derived
   from a detailed process-based understanding. We explicitly consider
   spatial interactions among multiple vegetation types and multiple
   resources, and our model is formulated to predict responses to a variety
   of endogenous and exogenous disturbances. The model is implemented in
   the deserts of the American Southwest both to test hypotheses of the
   causes of the invasion of woody shrubs, and to test its ability to
   reproduce observed spatial differences in response to drought in the
   20th century. The model's performance leads us to argue that vertical
   and lateral connectivity are key emergent properties of the ecosystem,
   which both control its behavior and provide indicators of its state. If
   this argument is shown to be compatible with field observations, the
   model presented here will provide a more certain approach toward
   preventing further degradation of semiarid grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{We used log-linear hierarchical models to analyze data from the Atlantic
   Flyway Breeding Waterfowl Survey. The survey has been conducted by state
   biologists each year since 1989 in the northeastern United States from
   Virginia north to New Hampshire and Vermont. Although yearly population
   estimates from the survey are used by the United States Fish and
   Wildlife Service for estimating regional waterfowl population status for
   mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), black ducks (Anas rubripes), wood ducks
   (Aix sponsa), and Canada geese (Branta canadensis), they are not
   routinely adjusted to control for time of day effects and other survey
   design issues. The hierarchical model analysis permits estimation of
   year effects and population change while accommodating the repeated
   sampling of plots and controlling for time of day effects in counting.
   We compared population estimates from the current stratified random
   sample analysis to population estimates from hierarchical models with
   alternative model structures that describe year to year changes as
   random year effects, a trend with random year effects, or year effects
   modeled as 1-year differences. Patterns of population change from the
   hierarchical model results generally were similar to the patterns
   described by stratified random sample estimates, but significant
   visibility differences occurred between twilight to midday counts in all
   species. Controlling for the effects of time of day resulted in larger
   population estimates for all species in the hierarchical model analysis
   relative to the stratified random sample analysis. The hierarchical
   models also provided a convenient means of estimating population trend
   as derived statistics from the analysis. We detected significant
   declines in mallard and American black ducks and significant increases
   in wood ducks and Canada geese, a trend that had not been significant
   for 3 of these 4 species in the prior analysis. We recommend using
   hierarchical models for analysis of the Atlantic Flyway Breeding
   Waterfowl Survey. Published 2014. This article is a U.S. Government work

Abstract = {{Aim Southern temperate tree lines are found at low elevations compared
   with their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. They are also regarded as
   forming at warm temperatures, which has been attributed to
   taxon-specific limitations. Using New Zealand tree lines as an example,
   we assess whether these tree lines are anomalously warm compared with
   the global mean.
   Location New Zealand.
   Methods Soil and air temperatures were measured over 2 years at six New
   Zealand tree line sites, and compared with other local and global
   growing season temperature data. In New Zealand and other oceanic
   regions, the long, variable seasonal transitions make calculations of
   mean growing season temperatures highly sensitive to how the growing
   season is defined. We used both the conventional (wide) definition (from
   when mean weekly root-zone temperature exceeds 3.2 degrees C in spring,
   to when it first falls below 3.2 degrees C in autumn) and a narrow
   definition (the period during which temperatures are continuously above
   3.2 C). Application of these criteria leads to similar mean growing
   season temperatures in continental regions, but different ones in
   oceanic regions. We tested whether growing season temperatures differ
   between northern and southern temperate tree lines.
   Results New Zealand tree lines had a mean root-zone temperature during
   the wide growing season of 7.0 degrees C +/- 0.4 SD, not significantly
   different from those at northern temperate tree lines. The mean
   temperature of the narrow growing season was 7.8 degrees C, warmer than
   tree lines elsewhere, but still within the range reported for temperate
   tree lines (7-8 degrees C).
   Main conclusions Whilst they are found at lower elevations, New Zealand
   tree lines form at temperatures similar to those at Northern Hemisphere
   temperate tree lines. Together with similar recent evidence from Chile,
   these results refute the previously postulated taxon-specific limitation
   hypothesis, and suggest these southern temperate tree lines are not
   climatically depressed, but are governed by the same thermal threshold
   as other tree lines worldwide.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Through 3 broad and interconnected streams of thought, resilience
   thinking has influenced the science of ecology and natural resource
   management by generating new multidisciplinary approaches to
   environmental problem solving. Resilience science, adaptive management
   (AM), and ecological policy design (EPD) contributed to an
   internationally unified paradigm built around the realization that
   change is inevitable and that science and management must approach the
   world with this assumption, rather than one of stability. Resilience
   thinking treats actions as experiments to be learned from, rather than
   intellectual propositions to be defended or mistakes to be ignored. It
   asks what is novel and innovative and strives to capture the overall
   behavior of a system, rather than seeking static, precise outcomes from
   discrete action steps. Understanding the foundations of resilience
   thinking is an important building block for developing more holistic and
   adaptive approaches to conservation. We conducted a comprehensive review
   of the history of resilience thinking because resilience thinking
   provides a working context upon which more effective, synergistic, and
   systems-based conservation action can be taken in light of rapid and
   unpredictable change. Together, resilience science, AM, and EPD bridge
   the gaps between systems analysis, ecology, and resource management to
   provide an interdisciplinary approach to solving wicked problems.}},

Abstract = {{The functional resistance and resilience of soils from across the South
   Island of New Zealand were assessed. Soils were collected from under
   varying land-uses (pasture, pine forest, native forest) at each of four
   different locations (Hokitika, Craigieburn, Eyrewell, Orton Bradley
   Park). Soil function was measured using carbon utilization profiles
   (MicroResp technique), and responses to freeze-thaw disturbance assessed
   in a multivariate approach. Resistance was defined as the amount of
   change in functional profiles (multivariate distance) before, and then
   10 h after, disturbance. Resilience was defined as the stability in
   ecosystem function over time (6 sample points spanning 17 days after
   initial freeze-thaw disturbance). The functional resistance of soils was
   not linked to land-use nor sampling location (permanova P > 0.05) but
   was negatively correlated with soil Olsen-P levels
   (biological-environmental matching (BIO-ENV test); rho = 0.604, P =
   0.04). Secondary factors associated with soil organic matter status were
   associated with functional resistance in soil of low Olsen-P. This was
   explicitly tested by repeating the experiment in soils collected from a
   long-term P fertilizer management trial; functional resistance remained
   linked to the underlying P status of the soils (P = 0.002). The
   functional stability of soil (post-disturbance) was associated with
   long-term rainfall (canonical analysis on principal coordinates - CAP
   analysis; P = 0.039); soils from high rainfall sites were more stable
   after disturbance. The results show that variables linked to functional
   resistance and resilience in soils are different. Furthermore,
   resilience was not correlated with resistance, or with measures of
   functional diversity (e. g. evenness of substrate mineralization).
   Alteration of the P status of soils is likely to impact on the capacity
   of soils to rapidly respond to disturbance, whereas drivers of climate,
   such as global warming, may impact soil functional resilience.}},

Abstract = {{Since first introduced to North America in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV)
   has spread rapidly across the continent, threatening wildlife
   populations and posing serious health risks to humans. While WNV
   incidence has been linked to environmental factors, particularly
   temperature and rainfall, little is known about how future climate
   change may affect the spread of the disease. Using available data on WNV
   infections in vectors and hosts collected from 20032011 and using a
   suite of 10 species distribution models, weighted according to their
   predictive performance, we modeled the incidence of WNV under current
   climate conditions at a continental scale. Models were found to
   accurately predict spatial patterns of WNV that were then used to
   examine how future climate may affect the spread of the disease.
   Predictions were accurate for cases of human WNV infection in the
   following year (2012), with areas reporting infections having
   significantly higher probability of presence as predicted by our models.
   Projected geographic distributions of WNV in North America under future
   climate for 2050 and 2080 show an expansion of suitable climate for the
   disease, driven by warmer temperatures and lower annual precipitation
   that will result in the exposure of new and naive host populations to
   the virus with potentially serious consequences. Our risk assessment
   identifies current and future hotspots of West Nile virus where
   mitigation efforts should be focused and presents an important new

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The IUCN Red List is a widely accepted system for classifying species'
   risk of extinction, based on quantitative criteria. Although IUCN
   discourages the liberal use of the category ``Data Deficient{''} (DD),
   most assessed groups have a large number of their species assigned to
   this category, especially in the Tropics. Therefore, DD species can
   introduce considerable uncertainty into estimates of proportions of
   threatened species, and research focused on elucidating the true status
   of those species should be a priority. Here we propose a simple method
   to gather information on geographic distribution and guide the search
   for new populations of rare, small-ranged, forest species, using the
   literature, online data, and standard GIS procedures. The method
   involves: (i) creating a geographic distribution model; (ii) selecting
   the environmentally suitable sites from that model; (iii) removing sites
   that have lost natural vegetation; and (iv) removing habitat networks
   that are too small and/or isolated, based on thresholds established from
   known occurrence records and the literature for ecologically similar
   species. As a case study, we use Lonchophylla peracchii, a recently
   described forest-dependent bat endemic to southeastern Brazil. We found
   that environmentally suitable sites for L. peracchii are already heavily
   deforested, confirming habitat loss as a major threat. Importantly, we
   identified five priority sites to search for the species outside of its
   currently known distribution. From that, we discuss its likely status
   based on IUCN's Criterion B2 (Extent of Occurrence). This method could
   be useful for other poorly known forest species, especially in the
   Tropics where most of these species are, and funding for research and
   fieldwork is scarcest. Currently there are 1910 terrestrial vertebrates
   in tropical forest worldwide classified as DD that could be evaluated
   using this method, provided that they have at least 5-10 occurrence
   records. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive management incorporates learning-by-doing (LBD) in order to
   capture learning and knowledge generation processes, crucial for
   sustainable resource use in the presence of uncertainty and
   environmental change. By contrast, an optimization approach to
   management identifies the most efficient exploitation strategy by
   postulating an absolute understanding of the resource dynamics and its
   inherent uncertainties. Here, we study the potential and limitations of
   LBD in achieving optimal management by undertaking an analysis using a
   simple growth model as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of an
   agent equipped with a `state-of-the-art' learning algorithm. The agent
   possesses no a priori knowledge about the resource dynamics, and learns
   management solely by resource interaction. We show that for a logistic
   growth function the agent can achieve 90\% efficiency compared to the
   optimal control solution, whereas when a threshold (tipping point) is
   introduced, efficiency drops to 65\%. Thus, our study supports the
   effectiveness of the LED approach. However, when a threshold is
   introduced efficiency decreases as experimentation may cause resource
   collapse. Further, the study proposes that: an appropriate amount of
   experimentation, high valuation of future stocks (discounting) and, a
   modest rate of adapting to new knowledge, will likely enhance the
   effectiveness of LBD as a management strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier By. All

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{36-43}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The United States Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) specified
   that marine mammal stocks be maintained at an optimum sustainable
   population level (OSP). However, the information needed to directly
   estimate OSP for most stocks was not available and indices to OSP were
   soon proposed but to our knowledge none were fully developed. In 1994, a
   new management regime was adopted under the MMPA, potential biological
   removal (PBR), which was specifically developed to assess marine mammal
   mortalities associated with commercial fisheries. Pacific walruses
   (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) are rarely killed in commercial fisheries,
   the greatest source of human caused mortality is the subsistence harvest
   by Alaskan and Russian natives, and PBR estimates have been erroneously
   used to make inference about the sustainability of the subsistence
   harvest. It is clear that an index to OSP is needed for the Pacific
   walrus because PBR as calculated for fisheries is not appropriate. In
   this study, we explored calf:cow ratios (CCR), estimated from spring
   harvest data, as an index to population abundance and OSP as a function
   of habitat carrying capacity (K). Eight of the 10 characteristics of an
   effective index are applicable to CCRs. Based on abundance estimates
   when the Pacific walrus population was at or near K and a simulated
   estimate of maximum net productivity, CCRs of 0.41-0.47 reflect a
   Pacific walrus population at OSP. The best use of the CCR index will be
   to inform subsistence hunters of the status of the population and to
   promote self-regulation of the harvest by hunters. However, because
   other factors which may be weakly density-dependent such as disease and
   physical trauma could effect CCRs and the same CCR can be expressed by a
   declining or increasing population, the index will need to be combined
   with other information (e.g., habitat change and use patterns,
   population trend, physical condition of individuals, survival rates,
   etc.) in a weight of evidence approach in order to have stronger
   inference. Furthermore, our analyses are based on a data set that
   included periods when climatic conditions differed from those of recent
   decades, requiring evaluation of the index into the future. Published by

Title = {{Historical forest structure and fire in Sierran mixed-conifer forests
   reconstructed from General Land Office survey data}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Dry forests of the western United States (ponderosa pine, dry mixed
   conifer) are often considered at risk of uncharacteristic severe fires,
   but recent research has found historically extensive severe fire. This
   has left divergent perspectives about how to restore dry forests,
   protect people and infrastructure from fire, and interpret the
   ecological effects of large fires, such as the 2013 Rim fire, a
   human-set 104,000 ha fire in the western Sierra Nevada Mountains. To
   help resolve this uncertainty, I used new methods to reconstruct
   historical forest structure and fire and test 11 hypotheses about them,
   using A.D. 1865-1885 General Land Office surveys, across 330,000 ha of
   Sierran mixed-conifer forests. The reconstructions show these historical
   forests were open and park-like in places, but generally dense,
   averaging 293 trees/ ha; shade-tolerant trees and large trees were
   abundant, but smaller (<60 cm diameter) pines and oaks numerically
   dominated. These smaller trees, along with common understory seedlings
   and saplings and almost pervasive shrubs, created abundant ladder fuels.
   It is not surprising, given these conditions, that just 13-26\% of
   historical Sierran mixed-conifer forests had only low-severity fire,
   with mixed-severity fire over 43-48\%, and high-severity fire over
   31-39\% of the land area. The high-severity fire rotation was 281 years
   in the northern and 354 years in the southern Sierra, short enough to
   contribute to high levels of heterogeneity, including abundant areas and
   large patches (up to 9400 ha) of early-successional forest and montane
   chaparral, but long enough to allow recovery of old-growth forest over
   large land areas. Proposals to reduce fuels and fire severity would
   actually reduce, not restore, historical forest heterogeneity important
   to wildlife and resiliency. Sierran mixed-conifer forests are inherently
   dangerous places to live, which cannot be changed without creating
   artificial forests over large land areas. However, people can adapt to
   fires by channeling development to safer areas and modifying ignition
   zones near houses and communities to survive fire.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Woody plant encroachment into former grasslands currently
   represents a major physiognomic shift globally. Seedling establishment
   is a critical demographic bottleneck and is considered to be alleviated
   by increases in water availability and negatively impacted by
   interactions with grasses, particularly when water stress increases.
   However, interactions with grasses that are not actively competing for
   resources ('passive interactions' when grasses are dead) has seldom been
   considered. Could the transition from a live to a dead grass (litter)
   canopy favour recruitment of woody seedlings in a semi-arid grassland of
   the American SW? How does the sign and intensity of grass-seedling
   interactions change across drastically different summer precipitation
   regimes with and without passive interactions?
   Location: Sonoran Desert shrub savanna at the Santa Rita Experimental
   Range, near Tucson, AZ, US.
   Methods: Four cohorts of Prosopis velutina seeds were planted annually
   (20022005) under rainout shelters that intercepted all incoming
   precipitation on a soil with sandy loam texture. Summer precipitation
   was manipulated to simulate either a 50\% increase or decrease in the
   long-termmean, and cover was manipulated to simulate a grassland
   dominated by the C-4 bunchgrass Heteropogon contortus or left
   unvegetated. Emergence and survival of P. velutina was monitored and
   compared across cover types, along with monitoring of soil water content
   and light interception.
   Results: Strong active competition was observed with live grasses, under
   both summer drought and also under ample summer water supply. However,
   the pattern was reversed and strong passive facilitation of P. velutina
   was observed over time when grass canopies died and remained in place.
   This passive facilitation under dry summers was so strong that
   recruitment under dead grass conditions was comparable to that observed
   when ample water supply removed the effects of competition on
   unvegetated plots.
   Conclusions: After significant mortality of standing grass canopies,
   which typically compete for limited soil moisture resources, rates of
   recruitment by shrubs may increase even with significant seasonal
   drought. This work extends our understanding of interactions among
   co-located organisms and their effects on plant community dynamics, and
   introduces a new hypothesis on how grass litter facilitates woody plant
   encroachment during seasonal droughts.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Hurricanes are a major factor influencing forest structure and
   have been linked to higher incidences of multiple-stemmed trees in
   Caribbean dry forests relative to the continent. In Sept 1998, category
   3 Hurricane Georges passed over Mona Island. This island, unlike others
   in the Caribbean, has had feral goats for five centuries. In this study
   we addressed the following questions: (i) what are the short-term (4 mo)
   and long-term (10 yr) responses of Mona Island's dry forests to
   hurricane disturbance in terms of forest structure and tree mortality;
   and (ii) is there any effect of goat exclusion on the recovery process
   and forest structure after the hurricane?
   Location: Dry forest of Mona Island, Puerto Rico.
   Methods: Permanent fenced and unfenced plots established in 1997 and
   monitored annually until 2008 were used to evaluate the interplay
   between goat herbivory and hurricane effects on structural dynamics of
   the tree community. Within these plots, vegetation data collected
   include species identity, DBH, successional status and hurricane-related
   tree mortality.
   Results: We found that vegetation responses to hurricane disturbances
   may have been influenced by the presence of feral goats through at least
   two mechanisms. First, goats may have led to changes in forest structure
   and composition that feed back into the recovery dynamics that follow
   hurricane events. Second, goat herbivory limits the production of
   multiple stems, a trait that could be an adaptive response in
   hurricane-prone areas. Feral goats may lead to alternate successional
   pathways by keeping this dry forest at early-successional stages much
   longer than expected, and shifting vegetation communities to an
   alternate state where smaller, shrubbier and perhaps less palatable
   species dominate.
   Conclusions: Differences in structure between Mona Island's dry forest
   and other tropical dry forests are related to changes in species
   composition that may have been triggered by introduced goats. Our
   results highlight the potential complexities that may arise when setting
   management goals within the context of novel ecosystems. Ultimately,
   implementation of management goals requires knowing what changes are
   linked to the ecological integrity of the ecosystem and what cultural
   values are placed on the current state of the tree community vs its
   historical condition.}},

Abstract = {{Variation of DNA methylation is thought to play an important role for
   rapid adjustments of plant populations to dynamic environmental
   conditions, thus compensating for the relatively slow response time of
   genetic adaptations. However, genetic and epigenetic variation of wild
   plant populations has not yet been directly compared in fast changing
   environments. Here, we surveyed populations of Viola elatior from two
   adjacent habitat types along a successional gradient characterized by
   strong differences in light availability. Using amplified fragment
   length polymorphisms (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive amplification
   polymorphisms (MSAP) analyses, we found relatively low levels of genetic
   (H-gen' = 0.19) and epigenetic (H-epi' = 0.23) diversity and high
   genetic (phi(ST) = 0.72) and epigenetic (phi(ST) = 0.51) population
   differentiation. Diversity and differentiation were significantly
   correlated, suggesting that epigenetic variation partly depends on the
   same driving forces as genetic variation. Correlation-based genome scans
   detected comparable levels of genetic (17.0\%) and epigenetic (14.2\%)
   outlier markers associated with site specific light availability.
   However, as revealed by separate differentiation-based genome scans for
   AFLP, only few genetic markers seemed to be actually under positive
   selection (0-4.5\%). Moreover, principal coordinates analyses and Mantel
   tests showed that overall epigenetic variation was more closely related
   to habitat conditions, indicating that environmentally induced
   methylation changes may lead to convergence of populations experiencing
   similar habitat conditions and thus may play a major role for the
   transient and/or heritable adjustment to changing environments.
   Additionally, using a new MSAP-scoring approach, we found that mainly
   the unmethylated (phi(ST) = 0.60) and CG-methylated states (phi(ST) =
   0.46) of epiloci contributed to population differentiation and putative
   habitat-related adaptation, whereas CHG-hemimethylated states (phi(ST) =
   0.21) only played a marginal role.}},

Abstract = {{A long-standing debate within conservation is how best to allocate
   limited management resources: should reserve area be increased, should
   anthropogenic disturbances be mitigated, or should connectivity be
   increased? We explore these issues for the San Diego cactus wren, a
   California Species of Special Concern. To assess the relative benefit of
   different post-fire habitat restoration strategies, we forecasted wren
   abundance over the next 100 years under three restoration strategies:
   (i) create new ``stepping stone{''} habitat patches to form corridors
   which connect existing patches, (ii) augment existing habitat patches,
   and (iii) create new habitat patches in areas with low fire risk. We
   considered both small-scale and large-scale restoration efforts of 20
   and 200 ha of habitat, respectively. To forecast wren abundance, we used
   a meta-population model created from maps of wren abundance, cactus
   abundance, land use, and estimated fire probability. Estimates of fire
   probability were obtained by relating previous fire locations to
   environmental variables and human population density. Results indicate
   that the best management strategy for a 20-ha restoration effort is to
   augment habitat in patches habitable for wrens, and that the best
   strategy for 180 ha of additional restoration (or 200 total hectares) is
   to improve wren dispersal via new corridors. Results also indicate that
   there is no decline in long-term wren abundance caused by planning the
   first 20 ha of restoration separately from planning a subsequent 180 ha.
   Our modeling approach provides insight into the relative benefit of
   several realistic restoration scenarios, providing an important tool for
   species conservation and habitat restoration on complex landscapes. (C)

Abstract = {{The perceived threat of climate change is often evaluated from species
   distribution models that are fitted to many species independently and
   then added together. This approach ignores the fact that species are
   jointly distributed and limit one another. Species respond to the same
   underlying climatic variables, and the abundance of any one species can
   be constrained by competition; a large increase in one is inevitably
   linked to declines of others. Omitting this basic relationship explains
   why responses modeled independently do not agree with the species
   richness or basal areas of actual forests.
   We introduce a joint species distribution modeling approach (JSDM),
   which is unique in three ways, and apply it to forests of eastern North
   America. First, it accommodates the joint distribution of species.
   Second, this joint distribution includes both abundance and
   presence-absence data. We solve the common issue of large numbers of
   zeros in abundance data by accommodating zeros in both stem counts and
   basal area data, i.e., a new approach to zero inflation. Finally,
   inverse prediction can be applied to the joint distribution of
   predictions to integrate the role of climate risks across all species
   and identify geographic areas where communities will change most (in
   terms of changes in abundance) with climate change. Application to
   forests in the eastern United States shows that climate can have
   greatest impact in the Northeast, due to temperature, and in the Upper
   Midwest, due to temperature and precipitation. Thus, these are the
   regions experiencing the fastest warming and are also identified as most
   responsive at this scale.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To describe the structural and floristic diversity of New
   Caledonian mixed tropical rain forest and investigate its environmental
   determinants.
   Location: New Caledonia (SW Pacific), a biodiversity hotspot.
   Methods: Structural (stem density, basal area) and floristic
   characteristics (composition, species richness and dissimilarity) were
   investigated along environmental gradients (elevation, rainfall and
   slope) on different substrates (ultramafic and non-ultramafic) through
   the New Caledonian Plant Inventory and Permanent Plots Network
   (NC-PIPPN, 201 plots each measuring 20 m x 20 m).
   Results: A total of 28,640 trees (DBH >= 5 cm) belonging to 749 species,
   240 genera and 92 families were inventoried in the NC-PIPPN. The New
   Caledonian mixed rain forest studied was characterized as having high
   stem density, basal area and species richness, and many small stems
   (60\% of the trees <10 cm DBH and almost a quarter of species did not
   exceed this threshold). More than one-third of the species were rare
   (i.e. inventoried in less than three plots or represented by fewer than
   three individuals) in the plot network and floristic dissimilarity was
   high (Bray-Curtis index >0.70). The presence of ultramafic (UM) and
   non-ultramafic substrates (non-UM) combined with altitudinal and
   rainfall gradients were the main drivers of floristic dissimilarity,
   whereas the effect of geographic distance between the plots was
   surprisingly low. Floristic dissimilarity was very high between UM and
   non-UM substrates from species up to family level. About 75\% of the
   species occurred on a single substrate type. The mixed rain forest on UM
   and non-UM substrates differed in floristic composition but not in
   structure.
   Conclusions: NC-PIPPN proved to be an effective tool for investigating
   the woody species richness of New Caledonia as containing ca. 46\% of
   its non-herbaceous species. However, the network's design, and more
   specifically its small plots, restricts its capacity to capture beta
   diversity and forest structure. High species richness and floristic
   dissimilarity confirm that New Caledonian mixed rain forest is
   exceptionally rich.}},

Abstract = {{Question: How does floodplain forest vegetation react to a changed
   hydrological regime induced by a restoration project? Is it possible to
   model the Ellenberg moisture value (mF) using variables representing
   site moisture conditions? Does mF help predict changes in vegetation
   composition and thus help in validating restoration success?
   Location: Danube floodplain, Neuburg a. d. Donau, Bavaria, Germany.
   Methods: A Generalized additive model (GAM) and a generalized linear
   model (GLM) were used for spatial prediction of mF using groundwater,
   relief and soil variables as predictors. Vegetation response to a
   changed hydrological regime was tested through replacing the old
   groundwater model with a new model representing the new water regime.
   With the help of a GIS, a spatial distribution and a scenario map of mF
   was produced. Model validation was done by cross-validation and
   comparison between predicted and observed data from repeated vegetation
   sampling on permanent plots.
   Results: Groundwater level (minima of 2009) and soil thickness entered
   the final model as significant predictors of mF. The GAM of mF showed
   good predictive power, with more than 57\% of deviance explained. The
   corresponding GLM had slightly lower accuracy, with 51\% of deviance
   explained. Using the new groundwater model (minima of 2011) it was
   possible to forecast mF after restoration. Changes in mF are to be
   expected in areas directly affected by restoration measures. The model
   validation has proven that the quality of model prediction is good and
   represents the reality fairly well.
   Conclusions: The study has shown that mF is a useful indicator for a
   summary prediction of ecological change. It can be expected that
   restoration will turn overall conditions wetter, and vegetation will
   respond to these changes with an increase of wetland plant species. With
   the help of the model, it is possible to measure the success of the
   restoration project. It is demonstrated that GAM can be used for
   intensive data exploration, after which a less complex and easily
   computable GLM can be parameterized.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{789-801}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Aims Flowering phenology is well documented to restrict the distribution
   of many plant species. However, community-level shifts in flowering time
   may occur either through exclusion of species with unsuitably early or
   late flowering for local conditions (composition-derived phenological
   shifts) or through intraspecific phenological responses to climate
   variations over space. Although these mechanisms have quite different
   ecological implications, the relative contribution of
   composition-derived phenological shifts remains largely unknown.
   Therefore, determining the magnitude of composition-derived phenological
   variation is crucial for understanding the relationship between
   phenology and community assemblage over space, and for predicting the
   impacts of future climate change. This study will evaluate the
   contributions of compositional differences to spatial variation in
   community-level flowering times throughout the early, mid and late
   portions of the growing season and across a variety of temperate
   environments. Location Continental United States. Methods This study
   develops novel herbarium-based methods to separate intraspecific
   phenological variations over space from changes in flowering time
   derived from differences in community composition. Results Although
   typically smaller than intraspecific variations, composition-derived
   shifts in flowering time explained up to 49.3\% of overall phenological
   variation. Composition-derived changes in flowering time among
   late-flowering species also explained the greatest proportion of overall
   variation and were the most responsive to differing climate conditions.
   Xeric regions also exhibited composition-derived phenological shifts
   that were stronger and more closely tied to climate conditions (R2 up to
   0.553) than other regions. Main conclusions These results indicate that
   interspecific differences in flowering time play a significant role in
   determining the composition of the plant community over space. However,
   the impact of flowering phenology on community assemblage varies
   considerably among seasons and climate regions, and appears to be
   strongest among xeric regions and among late-flowering species.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To understand climate and landscape drivers of species
   distributional shifts across broad spatial extents by integrating
   dynamic occupancy models with distribution data collected from the
   public.
   Location New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
   Methods We used data on koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) presence and
   absence collected across the state of NSW from public surveys between
   1987 and 2011. A dynamic occupancy model was built to quantify the role
   of climate and land use change on koala extinction risk and occupancy.
   We contrasted the model results against the more usual static occupancy
   model approach. We then developed scenarios of future climate, land
   clearing and urbanization and predicted the distribution of the koalas
   over the next 20 years based on the dynamic occupancy model.
   Results The static model indicates koala occupancy in 1987 and in 2011
   depended most strongly on annual rainfall and distance to water
   features. Housing density and its interaction with Eucalyptus forest
   cover only minimally affected koala occupancy. However, for the dynamic
   occupancy model, extinction risk (the metric of dominant concern for
   species conservation) depended most strongly on Eucalyptus forest cover
   and its interaction with housing density, while annual rainfall only
   minimally affected extinction risk. We predicted extinction risk to be
   higher in western NSW than in the east and that extinction risk may
   increase under future scenarios of climate and land use change.
   Main conclusions This study underlines the importance of incorporating
   extinction dynamics when modelling species distributional shifts under
   climate and land use change and we provide an approach for doing so
   using public-based surveys. As conservation objectives usually aim to
   maximize persistence, this is likely to lead to more reliable
   identification of conservation priorities than using static species
   distribution models. Combining public-based surveys and dynamic
   occupancy models provides a powerful approach for achieving this across
   broad spatial extents, thus providing an alternative approach when
   field-based data collection is impractical.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To examine the relationship between the range dynamics of the

   Correlation analyses were used to estimate the association between

   Results We documented L. dispar range expansion, stasis, and retraction

   in the amount of exposure above the optimal temperature for L. dispar
   larval and pupal development across this region. Temperature regimes in

   aggregation. The different analysis methods were compared based on
   criteria including the ability to differentiate among parks, sensitivity
   to uncertainty in assessment points, ability to use varied data sources,
   and information content for management. The results support the use of
   relatively simple methods such as distance-based aggregation scoring for
   long-term assessment of lands in this mixed-used landscape. Land use
   change within 5-km buffers adjacent to the parks was significantly
   correlated with overall scores and was a strong predictor of water
   quality measures. Urban parks generally scored slightly lower than parks
   located in more rural settings. However, the distance-based method
   penalized the urban parks less than other scoring approaches for several
   small problems, and urban parks scored fairly well by this recommended
   method. Trends in regional land use change should be carefully
   monitored, but at present, most of the parks along this urban-rural
   gradient are successfully fulfilling their mission of sustaining natural
   resources at a high level of ecological integrity. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Agent-based models can be used to simulate spatially-explicit animal
   behavioral processes and their interactions with human activities. This
   approach can be applied to predict the potential effects of such
   activities on animal behavior and individual condition that could lead,
   in turn, to alterations in vital rates and, ultimately, long-term
   population change. We developed an agent-based model to describe the
   effect of interactions with tourism on the behavior of bottlenose
   dolphins in Doubtful Sound (New Zealand). The model describes the
   temporal variation of the individuals' hidden motivational states, the
   way in which these states interact to determine the activity of groups
   of dolphins, and the feedback influence of the group's activity on
   individual motivations and condition. Moreover, it realistically
   simulates the movement of dolphin groups in the fiord. The model also
   includes tour boat behavior, incorporating the way key geographical
   features attract these boats. In addition to tourism effects, we
   accounted for the spatial heterogeneity in both dolphin activities and
   shark predation risk. The final simulation platform generated a
   realistic representation of the social and behavioral dynamics of the
   dolphin and boat populations, as well as observed patterns of
   disturbance. We describe how this tool could be used to ensure effective
   management of the interactions between anthropogenic factors and
   bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound, and how it could be adapted to
   evaluate the effects of human disturbance on other comparable
   populations. We then fitted the dolphin component of the model to data
   collected during visual studies of the Doubtful Sound dolphin population
   between 2000 and 2002 using a Bayesian multi-state modeling framework.
   However, when the parameter estimates from this fitting process were
   used in the agent-based model, biologically realistic representations of
   the population were not generated. Our results suggest that visual data
   from group follows alone are not sufficient to inform such agent-based
   models. Information on the spatial structure of the animals' activities
   and an appropriate measure of individual condition are also required for
   successful model parameterization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Island biogeographic studies traditionally treat single islands as units
   of analysis. This ignores the fact that most islands are spatially
   nested within archipelagos. Here, we took a fundamentally different
   approach and focused on entire archipelagos using species richness of
   vascular plants on 23 archipelagos worldwide and their 174 constituent
   islands. We assessed differential effects of biogeographic factors
   (area, isolation, age, elevation), current and past climate
   (temperature, precipitation, seasonality, climate change velocity) and
   intra-archipelagic spatial structure (archipelago area, number of
   islands, area range, connectivity, environmental volume, inter-island
   distance) on plant diversity. Species diversity of each archipelago
   (gamma) was additively partitioned into alpha, beta, nestedness and
   replacement beta-components to investigate the relative importance of
   environmental and spatial drivers. Multiple regressions revealed strong
   effects of biogeography and climate on alpha and gamma, whereas spatial
   factors, particularly number of islands, inter-island distance and area
   range, were key to explain beta. Structural equation models additionally
   suggested that gamma is predominantly determined by indirect abiotic
   effects via its components, particularly beta. This highlights that beta
   and the spatial arrangement of islands are essential to understand
   insular ecology and evolution. Our methodological framework can be
   applied more widely to other taxa and archipelago-like systems, allowing
   new insights into biodiversity origin and maintenance.}},

Abstract = {{Variable retention is an alternative silvicultural approach to timber
   forest management, which consist in a regeneration treatment with
   different degrees and patterns of stand retention. It has been proposed
   to mitigate harmful effects of harvesting, but effectiveness in insect
   conservation remains unknown in southern Patagonian Nothofagus pumilio
   forests. Here, the objectives were to: (1) define a baseline of insect
   diversity in old-growth forests along a site quality gradient (high,
   medium and low, associated to the forest productivity of each site); (2)
   evaluate stands with different retention treatments {[}aggregated (AR)
   surrounded by dispersed (DR) retention, and aggregated retention
   surrounded by clear-cut (CC)] and to compare with old-growth unmanaged
   forests (OGF); and (3) assess temporal changes during the first 4 years
   after harvesting (YAH). In a long term forest research plot, mobile
   epigean insect richness and relative abundance were characterized and
   classified in seven response type groups, using a wide spectrum sampling
   set. Data analyses included parametric and permutational ANOVAs,
   multivariate classification and ordinations. There were found 79 species
   before harvesting, and that richness was not related to site quality.
   After harvesting, 84 new species were added considering all treatments
   along the first four sampled YAH, of which 65 \% were added to OGF,
   while in harvested sites richness and abundance directly diminished with
   retention degree (OGF > AR > DR > CC) due to incoming species cannot
   compensate the lost of them. However, fluctuations in diversity were
   observed along the YAH. Therefore, harvesting reduces insect richness in
   N. pumilio forests independently of the treatment, but the original
   insect assemblage significantly changes due to loss of sensitive species
   and introduction of others from surrounding environments. Despite this,
   inclusion of aggregates greatly diminished harvesting impacts because
   insect assemblage is favoured when structural complexity is preserved,
   conserving richness and abundance at similar levels than in old-growth
   forests. However, more studies are necessary to evaluate effects of
   different aggregate size, shape and distribution into harvested forests,
   as well as their fragmentation and connectivity at landscape level.}},

Abstract = {{Since the 1960s there has been a global trend toward specializing and
   intensifying farming systems in order to produce more food. However,
   harmful environmental consequences have been recognized. Integrated
   crop-livestock systems (ICLS) are now being reconsidered as a means of
   improving farm and land sustainability. We suggest that understanding
   interrelations of ICLS to achieve sustainability requires scrutinizing
   the way farmers exploit them to adapt their farming system. We used six
   different case studies covering maritime and semi-maritime regions of
   France (beef and dairy + crop systems) to describe factors influencing
   production, environmental, and socio-economic considerations for change
   in farming practices. Farm surveys and analysis of farmers' practices
   and farm time-course of change were framed within the European farming
   system approach. Transition in the medium-term pointed out new
   interactions at stake between crops and livestock when farmers developed
   adaptation to climate changes, introduced grassland in contrast to the
   general trend of specialization and enhanced feed self-sufficiency. In
   the medium- and short-term, multifunctionality of crops and crop
   rotation adjustments, as well as regulation of cropping systems by
   livestock classes are the main levers of system flexibility. We showed
   how ICLS increased sustainability and began to notice the positive
   effects of farm collaboration. Further research is needed in partnership

   a nondestructive method to investigate the relationship between
   endocrine-disrupting contaminants and sex steroids in lake sturgeon from

   Niagara River lake sturgeon (n = 63) during April and May of 2012 for
   concentrations of 17 organochlorine (OC) contaminants that may affect
   endocrine function, as well as for abnormal levels of sex steroids

   concentration was well below levels known to adversely affect sturgeon
   reproductive physiology. In addition, qualitative analysis of
   chromatographs from plasma extracts did not show the presence of other
   peaks that matched polychlorinated biphenyl standard peaks. Comparisons
   of plasma steroid levels with those of others from the literature gave
   no indication of endocrine disruption, though plasma T levels were
   notably high in the lower Niagara River population. We conclude that

   that it is unlikely that significant contaminant-mediated endocrine

Volume = {{18}},

Pages = {{39-48}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we revisit the classic Lotka-Volterra model of competition
   between two populations and present some new results on the regime of
   bistability presented by this model. Initially, we review the results on
   the global stability analysis of the system and present a new global
   energy function. Then, we extend the model analysis in the case of
   strong competition, when the system has two asymptotically stable
   equilibria. The influence of parameters on the size and shape of the
   basins of attraction of these equilibria was characterized. The results
   show that the higher the rate of interspecific competition of a
   population, the greater the basin of attraction of the stable
   equilibrium that corresponds to the predominance of the same. In
   addition, the relative birth rate of population influences the curvature
   of the boundary between the basins of attraction which is the stable
   manifold of a saddle point. The influence analysis of this parameter
   reveals an interesting relation. Which population has more chances to
   survive depends on the context in which the initial conditions take
   place. In the case where populations begin with a large number of
   individuals, the one with a smaller birth rate will survive; in the case
   where populations begin with few individuals, the one with a greater
   birth rate will survive. We showed this result analytically by using the
   Picard method to approximate invariant manifolds and to obtain the
   expression for the curvature of the stability boundary. Finally, the
   analysis of the joint influence of competition and reproduction on the
   thresholds for initial conditions was made and the biological
   implications were discussed. We conclude that in terms of strategy for
   survival of a population, it is more efficient to adjust its
   reproductive rate than to improve its ability to withdraw resources from
   the environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to test and improve terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) using a
   variety of data sources have become increasingly common. Yet,
   geographically extensive forest inventories have been under-exploited in
   previous model data fusion efforts. Inventory observations of forest
   growth, mortality, and biomass integrate processes across a range of
   timescales, including slow timescale processes such as species turnover,
   that are likely to have important effects on ecosystem responses to
   environmental variation. However, the large number (thousands) of
   inventory plots precludes detailed measurements at each location, so
   that uncertainty in climate, soil properties, and other environmental
   drivers may be large. Errors in driver variables, if ignored, introduce
   bias into model-data fusion. We estimated errors in climate and soil
   drivers at U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots, and we
   explored the effects of these errors on model data fusion with the
   Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory LM3V dynamic global vegetation
   model. When driver errors were ignored or assumed small at FIA plots,
   responses of biomass production in LM3V to precipitation and soil
   available water capacity appeared steeper than the corresponding
   responses estimated from FIA data. These differences became
   nonsignificant if driver errors at FIA plots were assumed to be large.
   Ignoring driver errors when optimizing LM3V parameter values yielded
   estimates for fine-root allocation that were larger than biometric
   estimates, which is consistent with the expected direction of bias. To
   explore whether complications posed by driver errors could be
   circumvented by relying on intensive study sites where driver errors are
   small, we performed a power analysis. To accurately quantify the
   response of biomass production to spatial variation in mean annual
   precipitation within the eastern United States would require at least 40
   intensive study sites, which is larger than the number of sites
   typically available for individual biomes in existing plot networks.
   Driver errors may be accommodated by several existing model data fusion
   approaches, including hierarchical Bayesian methods and ensemble
   filtering methods; however, these methods are computationally expensive.
   We propose a new approach, in which the TBM functional response is fit
   directly to the driver-error-corrected functional response estimated
   from data, rather than to the raw observations.}},

Abstract = {{The recent global increase in forest mortality episodes could not have
   been predicted from current vegetation models that are calibrated to
   regional climate data. Physiological studies show that mortality results
   from interactions between climate and competition at the individual
   scale. Models of forest response to climate do not include interactions
   because they are hard to estimate and require long-term observations on
   individual trees obtained at frequent (annual) intervals. Interactions
   involve multiple tree responses that can only be quantified if these
   responses are estimated as a joint distribution. A new approach provides
   estimates of climate-competition interactions in two critical ways, (i)
   among individuals, as a joint distribution of responses to combinations
   of inputs, such as resources and climate, and (ii) within individuals,
   due to allocation requirements that control outputs, such as demographic
   rates. Application to 20years of data from climate and competition
   gradients shows that interactions control forest responses, and their
   omission from models leads to inaccurate predictions. Species most
   vulnerable to increasing aridity are not those that show the largest
   growth response to precipitation, but rather depend on interactions with
   the local resource environment. This first assessment of regional
   species vulnerability that is based on the scale at which climate
   operates, individual trees competing for carbon and water, supports

Abstract = {{Airborne laser scanning provides continuous coverage mapping of forest
   canopy height and thereby is a powerful tool to scale-up above-ground
   biomass (AGB) estimates from stand to landscape. A critical first step
   is the selection of the plot variables which can be related to light
   detection and ranging (LiDAR) statistics. A universal approach was
   previously proposed which combines local and regional estimates of basal
   area (BA) and wood density with LiDAR-derived canopy height to map
   carbon at a regional scale (Asner et al. in Oecologia 168:1147-1160,
   2012). Here we explore the contribution of stem diameter distribution,
   specific wood density and height-diameter (H-D) allometry to forest
   stand AGB and propose an alternative model. By applying the new model to
   a large tropical forest data set we show that an appropriate choice of
   input variables is essential to minimize prediction error of stand AGB
   which will propagate at larger scale. Stem number (N) and average stem
   cross-sectional area should be used instead of BA when scaling from tree
   to plot. Stand quadratic mean diameter above the census threshold
   diameter size should be preferred over stand mean diameter as it reduces
   the prediction error of stand AGB by a factor of ten. Wood density
   should be weighted by stem volume per species instead of BA.
   LiDAR-derived statistics should prove useful for estimating local H-D
   allometries as well as mapping N and the mean quadratic diameter above
   10 cm at the landscape level. Prior stratification into forest types is
   likely to improve both estimation procedures significantly and is
   considered the foremost current challenge.}},

Abstract = {{Created wetlands play an important role in the conservation of Least
   Bitterns (Ixobrychus exilis) by compensating for the loss of natural
   wetlands. In 2011, we studied habitat relationships of a major
   population breeding in a 128-ha cattail- and bur-reed-dominated
   impoundment in Quebec. We surveyed for bitterns and recorded habitat
   parameters at 30 points, making novel use of a small unmanned aircraft
   system (UAS) to obtain fine-scale land cover data. A model-selection
   approach based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC) determined that
   breeding density was best predicted by cattail cover in combination with
   water-vegetation edge density (Akaike weight = 0.88). Breeding density
   was unrelated to water depth, contrary to a previous study at the site
   after a dyke breach significantly lowered water levels, suggesting that
   above a certain depth threshold other habitat preferences take
   precedence. We recommend that management of created wetlands for Least

Abstract = {{Convergence is central to the study of evolution because it demonstrates
   the power of natural selection to deterministically shape phenotypic
   diversity. However, the conditions under which a common morphology
   repeatedly evolves may be restrictive. Many factors, such as differing
   genetic and environmental backgrounds and many-to-one mapping of form to
   function, contribute to variability in responses to selection.
   Nevertheless, lineages may evolve similar, even if not identical, forms
   given a shared selective regime, providing opportunities to examine the
   relative importance of natural selection, constraint, and contingency.
   Here, we show that following 10 transitions to durophagy (eating
   hard-shelled prey) in moray eels (Muraenidae), cranial morphology
   repeatedly evolved toward a novel region of morphological space
   indicative of enhanced feeding performance on hard prey. Disparity among
   the resulting 15 durophagous species, however, is greater than disparity
   among ancestors that fed on large evasive prey, contradicting the
   pattern expected under convergence. This elevated disparity is a
   consequence of lineage-specific responses to durophagy, in which
   independent transitions vary in the suites of traits exhibiting the
   largest changes. Our results reveal a pattern of imperfect convergence,
   which suggests shared selection may actually promote diversification
   because lineages often differ in their phenotypic responses to similar
   selective demands.}},

Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{623-631}},

Abstract = {{Conservation science increasingly focuses on how ecosystem functioning
   is affected by anthropogenic pressures, which implies an understanding
   of the structural and functional changes in biological assemblages and
   requires indicators to detect such changes within a suitable time frame.
   A novel approach that combines the spatial analysis of fishing gradients
   (based on vessel monitoring system records) with distance-based linear
   models was used to assess the response of several functional and
   structural metrics of fish assemblages to gradients of trawling, within
   four distinct habitat types. In addition, critical thresholds of
   trawling intensity were identified for the most sensitive metrics
   through piecewise regression models. Overall, total biomass and
   dominance (i.e. number of species that make up 90\% of the total
   biomass) metrics as well as metrics representing vulnerable features
   (such as chondrichthyes, species with very low resilience and sedentary
   species) were shown to be sensitive to fishing. Our results suggest that
   decreasing trends in these indicators are likely to be associated with
   direct and indirect fishing effects acting synergistically on specific
   features of fish assemblages leading to its homogenization, with likely
   impacts on ecosystems resilience. Critical thresholds at high, medium
   and low fishing intensity levels were identified depending on the metric
   used to assess fishing impacts, suggesting that it is difficult to
   define a single global target for fishing management as it ultimately
   will depend on management and conservation objectives (e.g. maintenance
   of biomass vs. maintenance of structure and function). Synthesis and
   applications. A key goal of the applied approach was to provide
   short-term indicators that are sensitive to gradients of trawling
   intensity and can be extrapolated to a broader geographical region. The
   identification of thresholds of fishing pressure that fish assemblages
   can withstand before ecosystem functioning is altered is key for the
   development of indicators as warning mechanisms, as well as to assess
   performance measures for management. Understanding responses to other
   pressure sources (e.g. pollution, dredging) requires further research,
   and combining an integrative functional traits approach with a wider
   range of pressures may help make this achievable.}},

Title = {{Herbivores in a small world: network theory highlights vulnerability in
   the function of herbivory on coral reefs}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{642-651}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The application of network theory within the field of ecology has
   predominantly been based around the examination of species interactions
   (e.g. food webs). Extension of networks to spatial ecology is currently
   limited, yet the approach has significant potential as a framework for
   analysing habitat connectivity and ecosystem stability. Examination of
   network structures characterizing the spatial dynamics of organisms has
   the potential to highlight the relative robustness or vulnerability of
   the ecosystem processes they support.
   On coral reefs, grazing by large herbivorous fishes is critical in
   maintaining the balance between coral and algae and is widely recognized
   as a key process in reef ecosystem functioning. However, the spatial
   dynamics exhibited by roving herbivores, and the implications of these
   dynamics for the overall stability and resilience of herbivory on reefs
   are not well understood.
   Here, we present a novel extension of network theory to the analysis of
   movements of marine herbivorous fishes within a reef system. Using an
   array of remote acoustic receivers, over a period of 12months, we
   tracked the movements of fishes belonging to the three dominant species
   of roving herbivore within a particular coral reef community.
   Analysing these movements in terms of network graph theory, we found
   that individual fishes clustered their activities within small sections
   of the available linear reef habitat, and movements within and outside
   of these home ranges were made along predictable routes. All three
   species were heavily reliant on particular, well-connected parts of the
   reef (nodes), mirroring an `ultra-small-world' network. This underlying
   dynamic creates vulnerability in the system, making targeted removal by
   fishing or the degradation of individual pockets of reef habitat more
   likely to result in a complete collapse in the overall process of
   herbivory at that particular area of reef.
   Our results highlight an inherent vulnerability in the movement dynamics
   of herbivorous fishes and, by extension, in the overall process of
   herbivory in reef ecosystems. They suggest that maintaining high
   herbivore abundances across all reef habitats is critical in preserving
   the integrity of the grazing function on reefs. The approach of using
   network graph theory to analyse acoustic telemetry data is illuminating
   and is likely to have a range of applications across diverse ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{745-754}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Non-native species with growth forms that are different from the native
   flora may alter the physical structure of the area they invade, thereby
   changing the resources available to resident species. This in turn can
   select for species with traits suited for the new growing environment.
   We used adjacent uninvaded and invaded grassland patches to evaluate
   whether the shift in dominance from a native perennial bunchgrass,
   Nassella pulchra, to the early season, non-native annual grass, Bromus
   diandrus, affects the physical structure, available light, plant
   community composition and community-weighted trait means.
   Our field surveys revealed that the exotic grass B.diandrus alters both
   the vertical and horizontal structure creating more dense continuous
   vegetative growth and dead plant biomass than patches dominated by
   N.pulchra. These differences in physical structure are responsible for a
   threefold reduction in available light and likely contribute to the
   lower diversity, especially of native forbs in B.diandrus-dominated
   patches. Further, flowering time began earlier and seed size and plant
   height were higher in B.diandrus patches relative to N.pulchra patches.
   Our results suggest that species that are better suited (earlier
   phenology, larger seed size and taller) for low light availability are
   those that coexist with B.diandrus, and this is consistent with our
   hypothesis that change in physical structure with B.diandrus invasion is
   an important driver of community and trait composition.
   The traits of species able to coexist with invaders are rarely
   considered when assessing community change following invasion; however,
   this may be a powerful approach for predicting community change in
   environments with high anthropogenic pressures, such as disturbance and
   nutrient enrichment. It also provides a means for selecting species to
   introduce when trying to enhance native diversity in an otherwise
   invaded community.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of spatial data sourced from either field-derived or
   satellite-based systems has created new opportunities to estimate and/or
   monitor changes in carbon sequestration rates, climate change impacts or
   the potential habitat alterations occurring across large landscapes.
   However, an effort to create models is not standardized, in part, due to
   different needs and data sources available for the models. For example,
   data may have different spatial resolutions with varying degrees of
   complexity in regards to inputs and statistical methods. This study
   determines effects of 20, 15, 10, five and one km sampling resolutions
   on detection of changes in net primary productivity (NPP), occupancy
   selection criteria for areas to be included in the sample and
   identification of significant variables impacting NPP in Indonesia
   forests. Production forest designated for selective harvest was used to
   define the sampling areas. Variances explained by predictive models were
   similar across cell sizes although relative importance of variables was
   different. Partial dependence plots were used to search for potential
   thresholds or tipping points of NPP change as affected by an independent
   variable such as minimum daytime temperature. Applying different cell
   occupancy selection rules significantly changed the overall distribution
   of NPP values. The magnitude of those changes within a cell size varied
   with changes in cell size. The mean estimated NPP for production forests
   across Indonesia differed significantly at every sampling resolution and
   occupancy selection criteria. Lows ranged from 1.107 to 1.121 kg C m(-2)
   yr(-1) for the 1-km cell size for the three occupancy selection criteria
   with highs ranging from 1.245 to 1.189 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) for the 20-km
   cell size. The difference in NPP values between these two cell sizes for
   the three occupancy selection criteria extrapolates to a range in annual
   biomass of 132 x 10(6) to 66 x 10(6) t for the total area of production
   forests in Indonesia.}},

Abstract = {{This model of stream epilithic biofilm biomass dynamics is based on the
   system of equations from Uehlinger etal. () and the term for autogenic
   detachment of biofilm from Bouletreau etal. (). Its new features are (i)
   a mathematical term based on estimated feeding activity of
   biofilm-dwelling invertebrates, (ii) local hydrodynamics considered as
   the principal factor governing algal traits and biofilm structure and
   (iii) a variable degree of parameterisation that was adjusted to biofilm
   biomass conditions.
   Biofilm biomass was monitored over a one-year period in the Garonne
   river in France (September 2008-2009). An allometric approach was used
   to estimate the feeding activity of biofilm-dwelling invertebrates based
   on their energetic requirements. Diatom functional diversity was also
   monitored to find how it varied with overall biofilm growth patterns.
   The one-year monitoring period was divided into six biofilm biomass
   cycles, with each cycle consisting of a phase of biofilm growth as the
   main process, followed by detachment.
   This model reproduced the observed data as a complex of biofilm
   growth/detachment cycles using different sets of empirical parameters
   which allowed (i) the dominant processes involved in each biofilm cycle
   to be evaluated and (ii) the six cycles of biofilm growth/detachment to
   be reproduced. This accounted for the observed patterns more effectively
   than a parameterisation using a single set of empirical parameters.
   High flow had a severe effect on biofilm dynamics through chronic and
   catastrophic detachment. Presumably as a result, assemblages of diatoms
   shifted towards species that were firmly attached and protected by
   mucilage.
   During low flow (and when temperature was high), biofilm dynamics was
   mainly affected by autogenic detachment and grazer activity. The grazing
   pressure of the dominant biofilm-dwelling invertebrates (Nematoda and
   larvae of Chironomidae and Trichoptera) was fairly low (a maximum of 6\%
   of biofilm biomass ingested daily); nevertheless, their presence in the
   biofilm seemed to favour biofilm autogenic detachment.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{65-76}},

Abstract = {{An intense debate is underway on the different approaches to measuring
   the importance of neighbour interaction. Both the ecological meaning and
   the statistical suitability of one of the most popular indices have been
   seriously questioned, but no simpler and practical alternative tools
   have been proposed up to now. This paper proposes a novel approach based
   on the use of new normalized inidices which scale the effects of
   neighbours and environment to the maximum target-plant potential. Two
   inidices related to environmental suitability and size-asymmetry are
   suggested as tools to stratify data in homogeneous subsets before
   analysis, and an index of normalized neighbour effect (N-n) is proposed
   to integrate the measuring of neighbour importance and intensity. When
   tested on literature data, N-n index proves to be very highly correlated
   to the most currently used importance index. At the same time, it is
   moderately but significantly correlated to the intensity index. Yet, an
   accurate reanalysis of three published datasets proves that several
   detected trends are predictable on the basis of the inherent properties
   of the used inidices. This is inextricably linked to the use of the same
   phytometers at different productivity levels. Thus, a glimpse is
   proposed towards the opportunity to use groups of equivalent
   competitors, each one working at a different point of the gradient, but
   all in a comparable range of environmental suitability and potential
   size-asymmetry relative to neighbours. Once defined these equivalence
   conditions, the normalized Nn metric is suited to measure how the
   relative weight of neighbour impact changes along the productivity
   gradient.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing concern about decline in biodiversity has created a demand
   for population surveys. Acoustic monitoring is an efficient non-invasive
   method, which may be deployed for surveys of animals as diverse as
   insects, birds, and bats. Long-term unmanned automatic monitoring may
   provide unique unbiased data from a whole season, but the large amount
   of data presents serious challenges for the automatic processing of the
   measurements. To demonstrate feasibility of automatic multi-channel
   surveying using a new prototype hardware, we carried out a 2-month study
   of echolocating bats requiring high data sampling rates (500 kHz). Using
   a sound energy threshold criterion for triggering recording, we
   collected 236 GB (Gi = 1024(3)) of data at full bandwidth. We
   implemented a simple automatic method using a Support Vector Machine
   (SVM) classifier based on a combination of temporal and spectral
   analyses to classify events into bat calls and non-bat events. After
   experimentation we selected duration, energy, bandwidth, and entropy as
   classification features to identify short high energy structured sounds
   in the right frequency range. The spectral entropy makes use of the
   orderly arrangement of frequencies in bat calls to reject short noise
   pulses, e.g. from rain. The SVM classifier reduced our dataset to 162 MB
   of candidate bat calls with an estimated accuracy of 96\% for dry nights
   and 70\% when it was raining. The automatic survey revealed calls from
   two species of bat not previously recorded in the area, as well as an
   unexpected abundance of social calls. The recordings provide data which
   can be used to correlate bat activity with rain, temperature, and
   sunset/sunrise. We discuss future applications, achieving higher
   accuracy in classifying bat calls and the possibility of using
   trajectory-tracking data to determine bat behavior and correct for the
   bias toward loud bats inherent in acoustic surveying. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Urban ecology and its theories are increasingly poised to contribute to
   urban sustainability, through both basic understanding and action. We
   present a conceptual framework that expands the Industrial : Sanitary
   Sustainable City transition to include non-sanitary cities, ``new
   cities{''}, and various permutations of transition options for cities
   encountering exogenous and endogenous ``triggers of change{''}. When
   investigating and modeling these urban transitions, we should consider:
   (1) the triggers that have induced change: (2) situations where crisis
   triggers change; (3) why cities transition toward more sustainable
   states on their own, in the absence of crisis; (4) what we can learn
   from new city transitions, and non-sanitary city transitions; and (5)
   how resource interactions affect urban transition s.
   Several existing theoretical frameworks, including sustainability,
   resilience, adaptation, and vulnerability, may be helpful when
   considering urban transitions. We suggest that all of these theories
   interact through inertia in urban systems, and that this multi-faceted
   inertia e.g. institutional inertia, infrastructural inertia, and social
   inertia imparts degrees of rigidity that make urban systems less
   flexible and nimble when facing transitional triggers and change. Given
   this, solutions to urban sustainability challenges may be categorized as
   those: (1) that ``tweak{''} the current systems and work with or even
   take advantage of the inertia in those systems, versus; (2) that are
   more ``transformative{''}, that confront systemic inertia, and that may
   require new systems. We propose that a model for addressing urban
   sustainability in the context of relevant theory, and for bridging
   research and practice, should focus on intercity comparisons. And one
   mechanism to facilitate this approach is a newly formed
   interdisciplinary Research Coordination Network (RCN) that focuses on
   urban sustainability by integrating urban research while incubating
   solutions-oriented products and collaborative partnerships with
   practitioners. The Network includes more than two dozen cities in five
   continents that are in various degrees of transition. In the true vein
   of sustainability science, our Network activities are incubating
   societally-relevant solutions through projects that will lead to
   tangible, ``on the ground{''} sustainable solutions for all types of
   cities. Our ultimate goal is to understand the process by which cities
   become more sustainable while affecting that process through action

Abstract = {{We introduce a novel approach to building corridors in spatial
   conservation prioritization. The underlying working principle is the use
   of a penalty structure in an iterative algorithm used for producing a
   spatial priority ranking. The penalty term aims to prevent loss or
   degradation of structural connections, or, equivalently, to promote to a
   higher rank landscape elements that are required to keep networks
   connected. The proposed method shows several convenient properties: (1)
   it does not require a priori specification of habitat patches, end
   points or related thresholds, (2) it does not rely on resistance
   coefficients for different habitats, (3) it does not require species
   targets, and (4) the cost of additional connectivity via corridors can
   be quantified in terms of habitat quality lost across species. Corridor
   strength and width parameters control the trade-off between increased
   structural connectivity via corridors and other considerations relevant
   to conservation planning. Habitat suitability or dispersal suitability
   layers used in the analysis can be species specific, thus allowing
   analysis both in terms of structural and functional connectivity. The
   proposed method can also be used for targeting habitat restoration, by
   identifying areas of low habitat quality included in corridors. These
   methods have been implemented in the Zonation software, and can be
   applied to large scale and high resolution spatial prioritization,
   effectively integrating corridor design and spatial conservation
   prioritization. Since the method operates on novel principles and
   combines with a large number of features already operational in
   Zonation, we expect it to be of utility in spatial conservation
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon (C) sequestration in forest biomass and soils may help decrease
   regional C footprints and mitigate future climate change. The efficacy
   of these practices must be verified by monitoring and by approved
   calculation methods (i.e., models) to be credible in C markets. Two
   widely used soil organic matter models - CENTURY and RothC - were used
   to project changes in SOC pools after clear-cutting disturbance, as well
   as under a range of future climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)
   scenarios. Data from the temperate, predominantly deciduous Hubbard
   Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in New Hampshire, USA, were used to
   parameterize and validate the models. Clear-cutting simulations
   demonstrated that both models can effectively simulate soil C dynamics
   in the northern hardwood forest when adequately parameterized. The
   minimum postharvest SOC predicted by RothC occurred in postharvest year
   14 and was within 1.5\% of the observed minimum, which occurred in year
   8. CENTURY predicted the postharvest minimum SOC to occur in year 45, at
   a value 6.9\% greater than the observed minimum; the slow response of
   both models to disturbance suggests that they may overestimate the time
   required to reach new steady-state conditions. Four climate change
   scenarios were used to simulate future changes in SOC pools.
   Climate-change simulations predicted increases in SOC by as much as 7\%
   at the end of this century, partially offsetting future CO2 emissions.
   This sequestration was the product of enhanced forest productivity, and
   associated litter input to the soil, due to increased temperature,
   precipitation and CO2. The simulations also suggested that considerable
   losses of SOC (8-30\%) could occur if forest vegetation at HBEF does not
   respond to changes in climate and CO2 levels. Therefore, the source/sink
   behavior of temperate forest soils likely depends on the degree to which
   forest growth is stimulated by new climate and CO2 conditions.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   Our aim was to investigate the evolutionary response of a freshwater
   Gondwanan relictual lineage to ongoing aridification of the Australian
   landmass. Australian snapping turtles (Elseya spp.) are riverine
   specialist species and were used to examine biogeographical hypotheses
   associated with changes to riverine connectivity through eustatic
   sea-level change, landform development and aridity across this
   understudied region.
   Location
   Northern and Eastern Australia and New Guinea.
   Methods
   Phylogenetic relationships were inferred for all extant species of
   Elseya plus two putative species not yet described, from molecular data
   comprising mitochondrial (control region, ND4 and 16S) and nuclear (R35
   intron) loci, using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. A
   calibrated relaxed molecular clock was used to estimate divergence
   times. Intraspecific lineage structure and diversity were investigated
   using control region sequences analysed via haplotype networks and
   AMOVA.
   Results
   Elseya species exhibited a striking degree of local endemism across
   their range. Four divergent clades corresponded geographically to New
   Guinea, southern New Guinea plus northern Australia, north-eastern
   Australia, and south-eastern Australia. These arose in the late Miocene
   (c. 5.82-9.7Ma), diversifying further in the early Pleistocene (c.
   2.2-2.43Ma and 1.36-1.66Ma), coincident with major phases of aridity and
   climatic upheaval.
   Main conclusions
   The genus Elseya has a long vicariant history in Australia, closely tied
   to disconnection of fluvial habitat through landform evolution,
   sea-level rise and ongoing aridification. Our analysis paints a more
   complete picture of Australian freshwater biogeography, including
   evidence for periodic connectivity with New Guinea, important regional
   biogeographical barriers, and the location of potential freshwater
   refugia. Congruence with patterns described for terrestrial groups
   implies a collective response of the Australian fauna to aridification.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{67-72}},

Abstract = {{The number of staging geese in northwestern Europe has increased
   dramatically. Growing goose numbers put strong grazing pressure on
   agricultural pastures. Damage to agricultural land may be mitigated by
   managing nature reserves in order to optimally accommodate large numbers
   of grazing geese. Livestock grazing has been shown to facilitate
   foraging geese; we take the novel approach of determining the effects of
   four different livestock grazing treatments in a replicated experiment
   on the distribution of geese. We present experimental field evidence
   that livestock grazing of a salt marsh in summer affects the habitat
   preference of foraging geese during autumn and spring staging. In an
   experimental field set-up with four different livestock grazing
   treatments we assessed goose visitation through dropping counts, in both
   autumn and spring. Grazing treatments included 0.5 or 1 horse ha(-1) and
   0.5 or 1 cattle ha(-1) during the summer season. The livestock grazing
   regime affected goose distribution in autumn, just after livestock had
   been removed from the salt marsh. In autumn, goose visitation was
   highest in the 1 head ha(-1) grazing treatments, where grazing intensity
   by livestock was also highest. In line with this result, goose
   visitation was lowest in the 0.5 head ha(-1) livestock grazing
   treatments, where the grazing intensity by livestock was lowest. The
   differences in goose visitation among the experimental treatments in
   autumn could not be explained by the canopy height. In spring we did not
   find any effect of livestock grazing treatment on goose visitation.
   Differences in the distribution of geese over the experiment between
   autumn and spring may be explained by changes in the availability of
   nutrient-rich vegetation. Livestock summer grazing with a high stocking
   density, especially with horses, can be used to attract geese to salt
   marshes in autumn and potentially reduces damage caused by geese to
   inland farmland. From a nature conservation interest point of view,
   however, variation in structure of the vegetation is a prerequisite for
   other groups of organisms. Hence, we recommend grazing of salt marshes
   with densities of 0.5 head ha(-1) of livestock when goose conservation
   is not the only management issue.}},

Title = {{From ecosystems to ecosystem services: Stream restoration as ecological
   engineering}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{62-70}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystem restoration was originally founded upon recovering ecosystems
   using wildlands as a reference state. More recently there has been
   interest in shifting to the restoration of ecosystem services - the
   benefits that natural systems can provide to humans. This shift is
   resulting in new restoration goals as well as new methodological
   approaches. The pace at which restoration goals and methods are changing
   is particularly fast for running-water ecosystems, which calls for a
   rigorous assessment of the environmental and economic costs and benefits
   associated with such changes.
   In this paper, we explore the environmental costs and benefits of an
   emerging form of urban stream restoration, in which ecosystems are
   vastly transformed in order to enhance specific ecosystem functions and
   support desirable services. These projects are usually implemented in
   highly incised low-order perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral stream
   reaches. In either case, the stream channel is transformed into a
   stormwater management structure designed to reduce peak flows and
   enhance hydraulic retention of stream flow with the goals of reducing
   bank erosion and promoting retention of nutrients and suspended
   sediments. Results to date indicate that this novel ecological design
   approach does modify the hydrologic responses of streams during some
   storm events, but there is no consistent pattern of nitrogen retention
   or removal that would lead to net annual benefits. While additional data
   are needed, results suggest there is the potential for sediment
   retention, at least during some flows. Ongoing work which includes
   monitoring both pre- and post-project implementation will help resolve
   this uncertainty.
   If sediment retention does occur, it is likely to decrease over time
   making the lifespan of these highly engineered projects is finite.
   Furthermore, environmental impacts associated with these projects can
   include loss or damage of riparian forests and export of sediment pulses
   during construction which may offset project benefits depending on their
   lifespan. Therefore, the use of approaches where entire existing
   ecosystems are modified to enhance a few specific biophysical processes
   should be limited to the most degraded systems where less invasive
   techniques, such as upland reforestation, reduced lawn fertilization, or
   better stormwater management at the source of runoff generation have
   first been exhausted. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   A case study from southern China}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Rivers provide critically important ecosystem services to society, and
   play an essential role in maintaining the structure, function, and
   integrity of landscapes in which the rivers reside. Better understanding
   of the patterns and processes in river systems requires a broader
   landscape approach that goes beyond the traditional linear and
   longitudinal focus. Such a landscape approach is especially important
   for effectively restoring and managing already damaged or degraded
   rivers around the world. Toward this end, here we develop a riverscape
   transect approach by adapting landscape gradient analysis with pattern
   metrics so as to quantify the longitudinal variations in the spatial
   pattern of the river-land complex from headwater to mouth. Two rivers
   systems in southern China were used to develop and demonstrate the
   approach. For each river, we first constructed a riverscape transect,
   consisting of a spatial series of overlapping neighborhood landscapes,
   then computed a selected set of landscape metrics, and finally depicted
   the longitudinal profile of riverscape pattern with relative
   location-based plots. Our results have shown that this riverscape
   transect approach is conceptually consistent with the increasingly
   prominent riverine landscape perspective and technically feasible with
   the aid of remote sensing data and landscape pattern analysis methods.
   In particular, landscape metrics, such as percentages of urban and
   native vegetation, patch density, and Shannon diversity, can be used to
   reveal important variations in riverscape structure along the river.
   These longitudinal profiles of riverscape pattern, used as spatial
   indicators, can help identify key socioeconomic drivers and ecological
   impacts of land use and land cover change in the watershed. Our study
   demonstrates that this riverscape transect approach can be a new and
   effective way of facilitating the planning and evaluation of river
   restoration and management efforts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In highly modified, or `novel', ecosystems it is often difficult to
   decide where limited conservation funds should be spent to reach
   management goals. We tested a recently-developed decision framework for
   novel ecosystems to help identify management options for modified native
   vegetation in the humid highlands of the Galapagos Islands. First, we
   conducted a data-based ecosystem assessment that compared contemporary
   vegetation to historical vegetation. This assessment characterised the
   biotic novelty of contemporary vegetation and resulted in a map of
   novelty over the landscape. Second, we considered processes affecting
   ecosystem change and barriers preventing the return to historical
   vegetation using state-and-transition models that incorporated the
   spatial extent of the contemporary vegetation states. Finally, we
   discussed options informed by our results that would address the
   management goals for our case study. Some of these options involve
   trade-offs between the goals of conserving biodiversity and maintaining
   ecosystem services, while other options address both goals in a win-win
   scenario. The novel ecosystems decision framework was a useful tool for
   identifying management options because it framed results that enabled a
   quantitative comparison of the degree of novelty of ecosystems across
   the landscape and also defined barriers to restoration. Tools that
   accounted for the spatial extent of the novel ecosystems complemented
   the framework, particularly for application at a landscape scale. Our
   approach could be broadly applied to the assessment and management of
   modified ecosystems, especially where historical data are available to
   calculate measures of biotic novelty. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In mountainous areas, high-head-storage hydropower plants produce peak
   load energy. The resulting unsteady water release to rivers, called
   hydropeaking, alters the natural flow regime. Mitigating the adverse
   impacts of hydropeaking on aquatic ecosystems has become a crucial step
   in recent water policies. We developed a novel economic-ecological
   diagnostic and intervention method to assess hydropeaking mitigation
   measures for fish habitat improvement. This method was applied to an
   Alpine river downstream of a complex storage hydropower scheme. The
   approach comprises (1) a hydropower operation model of flow regime
   generation and cost estimates for different mitigation measures, (2) a
   two-dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate the flow conditions in
   representative river reaches and (3) a dynamic fish habitat simulation
   tool to assess the sub-daily changes in habitat conditions of three
   brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) life stages (adult, spawning and
   young-of-the-year). Simulations showed that operational measures such as
   limiting maximum turbine discharge, increasing residual flow and
   limiting drawdown range incur high costs in relation to their ecological
   effectiveness. Compensation basins and powerhouse outflow deviation
   achieved the best cost-benefit ratio. Hydropeaking impact was strongly
   dependent on river morphology. Monotonous river reaches exhibited low
   habitat suitability for peak discharge, whereas a braided morphology
   provided high in-stream structure and thus suitable habitat for unsteady
   flow conditions. The interdisciplinary approach to economic and habitat

Abstract = {{Ecosystem-based fisheries management strategies require knowledge of
   trophic relationships. Trophic position (TP) estimates from compound
   specific nitrogen isotopic analysis of amino acids (AA-CSIA) show
   promise as the method can disentangle confounding factors associated
   with changing delta N-15 values at the base of the food web, but it has
   yet to be tested in many organisms. This novel technique requires two
   empirically determined biological parameters: 1)13, the difference in
   delta N-15 values between glutamic acid (glu) and phenylalanine (phe) in
   primary producers and 2) trophic enrichment factor (TEF), the N-15
   enrichment of glu and phe at each trophic step. Values of beta
   (3.4\%circle.) and TEF (7.6\%circle.) have been suggested for animals in
   aquatic environments: however recent observations indicate that TEF
   values may be variable, particularly among elasmobranchs where urea
   retention may alter nitrogen isotope fractionation between glu and phe.
   To test these uncertainties, we determined TEF values for three species

   hypothesis that urea retention lowers N-15 trophic enrichment between
   glu and phe in elasmobranchs. Rather, isotopic enrichment factors may be
   primarily driven by differences in dietary protein quality, leading to
   distinct TEFs for herbivores (similar to 7.6\%.) and carnivores

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{140-150}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Landscape graphs are now widely used for representing and analysing
   ecological networks. Although several studies have provided
   methodological syntheses of how to use these tools to quantify
   functional connectivity, it is still unclear how landscape graphs can be
   used for decision support in land planning. This paper outlines the
   different types of application that may provide relevant responses to
   the main questions arising in land planning about ecological networks.
   Three approaches are distinguished according to their objective: (1) to
   support prioritisation within an ecological network from a
   conservationist perspective; (2) to increase connectivity by identifying
   the best locations for adding new elements to the network, either when
   starting from the current state of the network or when seeking to
   mitigate the barrier effect engendered by a development project; (3) to
   assess the potential impact of a development project in terms of
   decreased connectivity. The computations based on connectivity metrics
   are explained for each of these three approaches. Then each approach is
   illustrated in the context of a pond network near the town of Belfort,
   in eastern France. The results show how the same connectivity metric

Abstract = {{This paper tests the steps required to transform a theoretical natural
   capital/ecosystem service framework for soils into an operational model.
   Each of the services provided by a volcanic soil under a pastoral dairy
   use are quantified and valued. The six guiding principles underpinning
   the method developed include differentiating soil services from
   supporting processes; identifying key soil properties and processes
   behind each service; distinguishing natural capital from added/built
   capital; identifying how external drivers affect natural capital stocks;
   analysing the impact of degradation processes on soil properties and
   basing the economic valuation on measured proxies. Proxies to quantify
   ecosystem services focus on the part played by soil in generating each
   service. This new approach highlights the importance of soil change in
   quantifying services, and goes beyond simply determining the status of
   soil natural capital. The total value of the ecosystem services provided
   by a volcanic soil under dairy in the Waikato region in New Zealand was
   estimated at \$16,390/ha/year on average over 35 consecutive years. The
   services with the highest value were the filtering of nutrients and
   contaminants (58-63\% of total value), followed by the provision of food
   and then flood mitigation. Regulating services had an economic value 2.5
   times more important than provisioning services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Agricultural land abandonment is one of the main drivers of land use
   change, leading to various responses of farmland ecological communities.
   In an effort to better understand the effect of agricultural land
   abandonment on passerine bird communities, we sampled 20 randomly
   selected sites {[}1 km x 1 km] in remote Greek mountains, reflecting an
   abandonment gradient, in terms of forest encroachment. We sampled 169
   plots using the point count method of fixed distance (47 passerine
   species), and we investigated bird diversity and community structure
   turnover along the gradient. We found that grazing intensity has a
   beneficial effect hampering forest encroachment that follows
   progressively land abandonment. Habitat composition changes gradually
   with forests developing at the expense of open meadows and heterogeneous
   grasslands. Forest encroachment has a significant negative effect on
   bird diversity and species richness, affecting in particular typical
   farmland and Mediterranean shrubland species. Birds form five distinct
   ecological clusters after land abandonment: species mostly found in
   pinewoods and cavity-dwelling species; species that prefer open forests
   forest edges or ecotones; species that prefer shrubland or open habitats
   with scattered woody vegetation; Mediterranean farmland birds that
   prefer semi-open habitats with hedges and/or woodlots; and, generalist
   forest-dwelling or shrubland species. We extracted a set of 22 species
   to represent the above ecological communities, as a new monitoring tool
   for agricultural land use change and conservation. We suggest that the
   maintenance of rural mosaics should be included in the priorities of
   agricultural policy for farmland bird diversity conservation. (C) 2013

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Habitat restoration is typically focused on reestablishing suitable
   conditions at a local scale, but landscape constraints may be important
   for keystone species with limited dispersal. We tested for time lags and
   examined the relative importance of local and landscape constraints on
   the response of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis)
   to restoration of Chihuahuan Desert grasslands in New Mexico, USA.
   Dipodomys spectabilis is a keystone species that creates habitat
   heterogeneity and modifies the structure of plant and animal
   communities. We selected 21 sites and compared density of D. spectabilis
   between areas treated with herbicide to control shrubs (treated areas)
   and paired untreated areas. We evaluated whether density of D.
   spectabilis depended on treatment age, local habitat quality (vegetation
   and soil structure), and landscape factors (treatment area and spatial
   connectivity). Density was greater at treated areas than at untreated
   areas due to a direct effect of reduced shrub cover. However, the
   response of D. spectabilis to restoration was lagged by a decade or
   more. Structural equation modeling indicated the time lag reflected a
   dispersal constraint as opposed to a temporal change in habitat quality.
   This inference was corroborated by a positive relationship between
   density at treated areas and connectivity to source populations. Our
   results indicate that density of D. spectabilis depended strongly on the
   spatial configuration of treated areas, which supports a landscape
   mosaic approach to restoration. If keystone species commonly exhibit
   limited dispersal ability, landscape constraints may be broadly
   important for shaping ecosystem structure and function after habitat
   restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Forest (or tree) age has been identified as an important determinant of
   the carbon (C) storage potential of forest soils. A large part of
   Central Europe's current forested area was affected by land use change
   with long periods of cultivation in past centuries suggesting that the
   organic C stocks in the soil (SOC) under recent forest may partly be
   legacies of the past and that stand age effects have to be distinguished
   from forest continuity effects (that is, the time since
   re-afforestation). We examined the influence of mean tree age and forest
   continuity on the SOC pool and the stores of total N and available P,
   Ca, Mg, and K in the soil (mineral soil and organic layer) across a
   sample of 14 beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests on sandy soil with variable
   tree age (23-189 years) and forest continuity (50-year-old afforestation
   to ancient ('permanent') forest, that is, > 230 years of proven
   continuity). Ancient beech forests (> 230 years of continuity) stored on
   average 47 and 44\% more organic C and total N in the soil than recent
   beech afforestation (50-128 years of continuity). Contrary to
   expectation, we found large and significant C and N pool differences
   between the forest categories in the mineral soil but not in the organic
   layer indicating that decade- or century-long cultivation has reduced
   the subsoil C and nutrient stores while the organic layer element pools
   have approached a new equilibrium after only 50-128 years. PCA and
   correlation analyses suggest that forest continuity cannot be ignored
   when trying to understand the variation in soil C stocks between
   different stands. Forest clearing, subsequent cultivation, and eventual
   re-afforestation with beech resulted in similar relative stock
   reductions of C and N and, thus, no change in soil C/N ratio. We
   conclude that the continuity of forest cover, which may or may not be
   related to tree age, is a key determinant of the soil C and nutrient
   stores of beech forests in the old cultural landscape of Central Europe.}},

Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{847-857}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Two dominant drivers of species distributions are climate and habitat,
   both of which are changing rapidly. Understanding the relative
   importance of variables that can control distributions is critical,
   especially for invasive species that may spread rapidly and have strong
   effects on ecosystems.
   Here, we examine the relative importance of climate and habitat
   variables in controlling the distribution of the widespread invasive
   freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea, and we model its future distribution
   under a suite of climate scenarios using logistic regression and maximum
   entropy modelling (MaxEnt).
   Logistic regression identified climate variables as more important than
   habitat variables in controlling Corbicula distribution. MaxEnt
   modelling predicted Corbicula's range expansion westward and northward
   to occupy half of the contiguous United States. By 2080, Corbicula's
   potential range will expand 25-32\%, with more than half of the
   continental United States being climatically suitable.
   Our combination of multiple approaches has revealed the importance of
   climate over habitat in controlling Corbicula's distribution and
   validates the climate-only MaxEnt model, which can readily examine the
   consequences of future climate projections.
   Given the strong influence of climate variables on Corbicula's
   distribution, as well as Corbicula's ability to disperse quickly and
   over long distances, Corbicula is poised to expand into New England and
   the northern Midwest of the United States. Thus, the direct effects of
   climate change will probably be compounded by the addition of Corbicula
   and its own influences on ecosystem function.}},

Abstract = {{AimRemote sensing data have been used in a growing number of studies to
   directly predict species richness or to improve the performance of
   species distribution models (SDMs), but their suitability for stacked
   species distribution models (S-SDMs) remains unclear. In this case
   study, we evaluated the potential and limitations of remotely sensed
   data in S-SDMs and addressed the commonly observed overestimation of
   species richness by S-SDMs.
   LocationMexico.
   MethodsPhenological and statistical metrics were derived from remotely
   sensed time series data (2001-2009) of the Terra-MODIS enhanced
   vegetation index and land surface temperature products. In a series of
   climatic and remote sensing-based SDMs, the distribution ranges of 40
   species of the genus Pinus (Pinaceae) were modelled based on
   presence-only herbarium and field data using the maximum entropy
   algorithm and summed to estimate species richness. Three different
   species-specific thresholds were applied to convert continuous model
   predictions into binary maps. Modelled species richness was compared to
   independent data from the Mexican National Forest Inventory.
   ResultsThe inclusion of remote sensing data led to significantly better
   predictions of species richness in comparison to the climate-based
   models for the summed suitabilities and all thresholds considered. Both
   climatic and remote sensing-based models allowed us to identify the
   areas with the highest pine species richness based on presence-only
   data. Remote sensing-based models compare closely with climate-derived
   patterns, but provide better spatial resolution and more detailed
   information on local habitat availability.
   Main conclusionsThe results of this case study provide general guidance
   for the potential and limitations of using remote sensing data in
   S-SDMs. Our results confirmed that remote sensing data may not only have
   the capability for improving individual SDMs, but also can be a
   potential tool for reducing the overestimation of species richness by
   S-SDMs. This approach opens up new possibilities for species richness
   predictions in areas where biological survey data are scarce and where
   no species richness inventory data exist.}},

Abstract = {{Many areas of the Arctic are simultaneously affected by rapid climate
   change and rapid industrial development. These areas are likely to
   increase in number and size as sea ice melts and abundant Arctic natural
   resources become more accessible. Documenting the changes that have
   already occurred is essential to inform management approaches to
   minimize the impacts of future activities. Here, we determine the
   cumulative geoecological effects of 62years (1949-2011) of
   infrastructure- and climate-related changes in the Prudhoe Bay Oilfield,
   the oldest and most extensive industrial complex in the Arctic, and an
   area with extensive ice-rich permafrost that is extraordinarily
   sensitive to climate change. We demonstrate that thermokarst has
   recently affected broad areas of the entire region, and that a sudden
   increase in the area affected began shortly after 1990 corresponding to
   a rapid rise in regional summer air temperatures and related permafrost
   temperatures. We also present a conceptual model that describes how
   infrastructure-related factors, including road dust and roadside
   flooding are contributing to more extensive thermokarst in areas
   adjacent to roads and gravel pads. We mapped the historical
   infrastructure changes for the Alaska North Slope oilfields for 10 dates
   from the initial oil discovery in 1968-2011. By 2010, over 34\% of the
   intensively mapped area was affected by oil development. In addition,
   between 1990 and 2001, coincident with strong atmospheric warming during
   the 1990s, 19\% of the remaining natural landscapes (excluding areas
   covered by infrastructure, lakes and river floodplains) exhibited
   expansion of thermokarst features resulting in more abundant small
   ponds, greater microrelief, more active lakeshore erosion and increased
   landscape and habitat heterogeneity. This transition to a new
   geoecological regime will have impacts to wildlife habitat, local
   residents and industry.}},

   analyze a long-term record from a single site, we applied a general
   linear model to weekly stream chemistry data at Biscuit Brook, NY, to
   simulate the effects of reducing sampling effort and to evaluate
   statistical confidence in the detection of change over time. To
   illustrate a detectable difference analysis, we analyzed a one-time
   survey of mercury concentrations in loon tissues in lakes in the
   Adirondack Park, NY, demonstrating the effects of sampling intensity on
   statistical power and the selection of a resampling interval. To
   illustrate a bootstrapping method, we analyzed the plot-level sampling
   intensity of forest inventory at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest,
   NH, to quantify the sampling regime needed to achieve a desired
   confidence interval. Finally, to analyze time-series data from multiple

Abstract = {{Background: Ethnobotany in South-Eastern Europe is gaining the interest
   of several scholars and stakeholders, since it is increasingly
   considered a key point for the re-evaluation of local bio-cultural
   heritage. The region of Gollobordo, located in Eastern Albania and
   bordering the Republic of Macedonia, is of particular interest for
   conducting ethnobiological studies, since it remained relatively
   isolated for the larger part of the 20th Century and is traditionally
   inhabited by a majority of ethnic Macedonians and a minority of
   Albanians (nowadays both sharing the Muslim faith).
   Methods: An ethnobotanical survey focused on local food, medicinal, and
   veterinary plant uses was conducted with 58 participants using open and
   semi-structured interviews and via participant observation.
   Results: We recorded and identified 115 taxa of vascular plants, which
   are locally used for food, medicinal, and veterinary purposes
   (representing 268 total plant reports). The Macedonian Traditional
   Ecological Knowledge (TEK) was greater than the Albanian TEK, especially
   in the herbal and ritual domains. This phenomenon may be linked to the
   long socio-cultural and linguistic isolation of this group during the
   time when the borders between Albania and the former Yugoslavia were
   completely closed. Moreover, the unusual current food utilisation of
   cooked potatoes leaves, still in use nowadays among Macedonians, could
   represent the side effect of an extreme adaptation that locals underwent
   over the past century when the introduction of the potato crop made new
   strategies available for establishing stable settlements around the
   highest pastures. Additionally, the difference in use of Helichrysum
   plicatum, which is popular in the local Macedonian folk medicine but
   absent among Albanians, confirms the particular significance of this
   taxon as it relates to the yellow colour of its flowers in South Slavic
   folklore.
   Conclusion: Botanical studies with an ethnographic approach are crucial
   for understanding patterns of use of plants within given cultures.
   Importantly, such studies can also allow for analysis of the dynamics of
   change in these TEK patterns over the time. The results of this study
   may be important as baseline data set to be used in rural development
   programs in Gollobordo, aimed at fostering community-based strategies of
   management of natural resources.}},

Abstract = {{No-take marine reserves (MRs) are a useful tool to study the ecosystem
   effects of fishing as many MRs have allowed ecosystems to recover to
   pre-fished states. Established in 2008, the Taputeranga MR, located on
   the south coast of Wellington, New Zealand, provides full no-take
   protection to the nearshore marine environment. Commercial,
   recreational, and customary fisheries are important in this region and
   commercial catch records for the last 70 years indicate that
   exploitation has greatly reduced the biomass of some species. We
   employed an ecosystem modelling approach to analyse the food web
   linkages on this coast immediately prior to MR establishment (the pre-MR
   state) for comparison to reconstructed historical and predicted future
   ecosystem states. Our results suggest that the organisation and function
   of the pre-MR ecosystem have changed since the 1940s, notably in terms
   of the role played by lobster (Jasus edwardsii). Historically, lobster
   were at least four times more abundant, and played a keystone role by
   directly negatively impacting the abundance of prey species, and
   indirectly positively influencing the abundance of the prey of their
   prey. While the fishery for lobster that operates today is well managed
   and sustainable from a single-species perspective, our results indicate
   that the fishery has reduced lobster biomass sufficiently to have
   significant impacts on the organisation and function of the nearshore
   temperate reef ecosystem along Wellingtons's south coast. Our results
   predict that over the next 40 years, the Taputeranga MR is capable of
   restoring the protected ecosystem to a state more similar to that
   observed in the past, prior to large-scale commercial exploitation. This
   finding has implications for the management of fisheries in other areas,
   as we have demonstrated the inability of the single species fisheries
   model to manage the ecosystem effects of fishing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

   southern fields showed the least. Findings from the landscape study
   showed that agricultural activity is a major driver of LULC patterns in
   the western region, with oil and gas activities serving a much smaller
   role. Methods and findings can be applied toward making extractive
   activities more sustainable during the various phases of expansion, new
   development and reclamation.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the dominant large-scale mechanisms proposed to combat climate
   change, biodiversity loss, and rural poverty, REDD+ (Reducing Emissions
   from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) has added further complexity
   to the challenging governance of rights and resources in global forests.
   As REDD+ is commodifying carbon, concerns emerge about how carbon
   ownership and its rights can be accommodated into the existing framework
   that governs local forest resource rights. The Nepalese government has
   formally entered into REDD+ policy preparations, but it lacks clear
   legal provisions regarding key forest tenure rights such as carbon
   ownership, benefit sharing, and the political participation of community
   forest user groups from national to local. As a result, Nepal's policy
   process points toward performance-based carbon forestry in a way that
   may undermine and weaken existing community tenure rights and forest
   tenure security.
   This paper discusses Nepal's potential impacts of new REDD+ and carbon
   ownership arrangements on forest tenure security and community-based
   forest governance. In a threefold methodological approach, the paper
   presents three scenarios for a REDD+-oriented tenure reform within the
   existing framework and assesses their concerns through in-depth
   qualitative interviews with key stakeholders, representatives, and
   advocates of Nepal's community forestry system, complemented by a review
   of government documents and academic literature of REDD+ lessons so far.
   The analysis identifies critical concerns for forest tenure security,
   state-community power relationships, and effective local institutions of
   the commons, and suggests that Nepal's REDD+ process is taking place at
   a particularly consequential time for structural changes of the forest
   governance framework.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary biology is a study of life's history on Earth. In
   researching this history, biologists are often interested in attempting
   to reconstruct phenotypes for the long extinct ancestors of living
   species. Various methods have been developed to do this on a phylogeny
   from the data for extant taxa. In the present article, I introduce a new
   approach for ancestral character estimation for discretely valued
   traits. This approach is based on the threshold model from evolutionary
   quantitative genetics. Under the threshold model, the value exhibited by
   an individual or species for a discrete character is determined by an
   underlying, unobserved continuous trait called ``liability.{''} In this
   new method for ancestral state reconstruction, I use Bayesian Markov
   chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample the liabilities of ancestral and tip
   species, and the relative positions of two or more thresholds, from
   their joint posterior probability distribution. Using data simulated
   under the model, I find that the method has very good performance in
   ancestral character estimation. Use of the threshold model for ancestral
   state reconstruction relies on a priori specification of the order of
   the discrete character states along the liability axis. I test the use
   of a Bayesian MCMC information theoretic criterion based approach to
   choose among different hypothesized orderings for the discrete
   character. Finally, I apply the method to the evolution of feeding mode
   in centrarchid fishes.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{47-57}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Animals moving through a complex environment change their movement
   patterns frequently. Such transitions from one movement behavior to
   another are a result of multiple factors such as weather, habitat and
   interspecific interactions occurring either individually or in tandem.
   Understanding where and when these changes occur is the first step
   towards understanding the limiting or key factors acting at different
   scales.
   We applied discrete wavelet analysis to find change points in the
   movement behavior of a Lesser Black-backed gull (Larus fuscus). We
   compared our results with results from the residence method proposed by
   Barraquand and Benhamou (2008) and the statistical method proposed by
   Lavielle (1999, 2005). Discrete wavelet analysis allows the
   identification and localization of change points by decomposing the
   frequency content of two time series consisting of step length and
   residence time data, while omitting the problem of redundancy of
   coefficients consistent with continuous wavelet transformation of
   movement data.
   We show that the novel use of discrete wavelet analysis in animal
   movement studies is widely applicable on different focus variables,
   allowing changes in the movement behavior and precise change points to
   be detected. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions resulting from international trade can cause major
   environmental and economic impacts. Propagule pressure is perhaps the
   most important factor influencing establishment, although actual arrival
   rates of species are rarely recorded. Furthermore, the pool of potential
   invaders includes many species that vary in their arrival rate and
   establishment potential. Therefore, we stress that it is essential to
   consider the size and composition of species pools arriving from source
   regions when estimating probabilities of establishment and effects of
   pathway infestation rates. To address this, we developed a novel
   framework and modeling approach to enable prediction of future
   establishments in relation to changes in arrival rate across entire
   species pools. We utilized 13828 border interception records from the
   United States and New Zealand for 444 true bark beetle (Scolytinae) and
   longhorned beetle (Cerambycidae) species detected between 1949 and 2008
   as proxies for arrival rates to model the relationship between arrival
   and establishment rates. Nonlinearity in this relationship implies that
   measures intended to reduce the unintended transport of potential
   invaders (such as phytosanitary treatments) must be highly effective in
   order to substantially reduce the rate of future invasions, particularly
   if trade volumes continue to increase.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The presence of sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) in rangelands has
   declined due to the invasion of annual grasses such as cheatgrass
   (Bromus tectorum) and the feedback between these flammable grasses and
   wildfire frequency. Monitoring the change and distribution of suitable
   habitat and fuel loads is an important aspect of sagebrush management,
   particularly under future climate conditions. Assessments of sagebrush
   biomass are used to monitor habitat for critical wildlife species,
   determine fire risk, and quantify carbon storage. Field techniques such
   as destructive and point-intercept sampling have been used to determine
   sagebrush biomass, but both of these techniques can be expensive and
   time consuming to implement. Light detection and ranging techniques,
   including airborne laser scanning and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS)
   have potential for rapidly assessing biomass in sagebrush steppe. This
   study used TLS to estimate biomass of 29 sagebrush plants in Reynolds
   Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho. Biomass was estimated using
   TLS-derived volume, then compared with destructive samples to assess the
   estimation accuracy. This accuracy level was then contrasted with the
   estimates obtained using point-intercept sampling of the same plants.
   The TLS approach (R-2=0.90) was slightly better for predicting total
   biomass than point-intercept sampling (R-2=0.85). Prediction of green
   biomass, or production, was more accurate using TLS-derived volume
   (R-2=0.86) than point-intercept sampling (R-2=0.65). This study explores
   a promising new method to repeatedly monitor sagebrush biomass across
   extensive landscapes. Future work should focus on making this method
   independent of sensor type, scan distance, scan number, and study area.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall runoff erosivity (R) is one key climate factor that controls
   water erosion. Quantifying the effects of climate change-induced
   erosivity change is important for identifying critical regions prone to
   soil erosion under a changing environment. In this study we first
   evaluate the changes of R from 1970 to 2090 across the United States
   under nine climate conditions predicted by three general circulation
   models for three emissions scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1) from the Fourth
   Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
   Then, we identify watersheds that are most vulnerable to future climate
   change in terms of soil erosion potential. We develop a novel approach
   to evaluate future trends of R magnitude and variance by incorporating
   both the rate of change with time as well as the level of agreement
   between climatic projections. Our results show that mean decadal R
   values would increase with time according to all nine climatic
   projections considered between 1970 and 2090. However, these trends vary
   widely spatially. In general, catchments in the northeastern and
   northwestern United States are characterized by strong increasing trends
   in R, while the trends in the midwestern and southwestern United States
   are either weak or inconsistent among the nine climatic projections
   considered. The northeastern and northwestern United States will likely
   experience a significant increase in annual variability of R (i.e.,
   increase in extreme events). Conversely the variability of R is unlikely
   to change in large areas of the Midwest. At the watershed scale (8-digit
   Hydrologic Unit Code), the mean vulnerability to erosion scores vary
   between -0.12 and 0.35 with a mean of 0.04. The five hydrologic regions
   with the highest mean vulnerability to erosion are 5, 6, 2, 1, and 17,
   with values varying between 0.06 and 0.09. These regions occupy large
   areas of Ohio, Maryland, Indiana, Vermont, and Illinois, with mean
   erosion vulnerability score statewide above 0.08. Future watershed
   management aiming at reducing soil erosion should focus on areas with
   the highest soil erosion vulnerability identified by this study.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It is currently a much debated topic the potential economic benefits of
   biomass use for biodiesel production in arid lands. In this respect, the
   main focus has been directed to determine which different plant species
   are highly adapted and capable to produce significant amounts of
   triglycerides to be used in the biodiesel industry under arid
   conditions. However, very few studies have addressed the technological
   changes that will be needed to convert triglycerides into biofuels
   without making a large consumption of scarce water, as it is demanded by
   current technology. Beside, with current conventional
   transesterification technology, the production of glycerine as a
   byproduct is also a serious problem because of the large water
   requirements needed for its removal from biodiesel, before it can be
   used in motor engines. The main methods commonly employed to reduce the
   viscosity of vegetable oil in order to be used in diesel engines are its
   high dilution with petrodiesel (<10\%), the breakdown and deoxygenation
   of the fatty acids from triglycerides through hydrotreating, and the
   cleavage of the triglycerides into its fatty acid components. In the
   later case, the cleavage can be carried out with generating glycerine as
   a byproduct, or by integrating the glycerine in the biofuel using
   several methods recently developed. The present contribution aims to
   explain the current state of available technologies for the production
   of biofuels for diesel engines, with special emphasis on, the
   possibilities of implementing the free or immobilized lipases for the
   development of new types of biofuels that integrate glycerine, and avoid
   waste production, that consume valuable and scarce water resources, thus
   achieving a feasible biofuels production in arid lands. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Question
   Aspen forests in the northern hemisphere provide richer biodiversity
   compared to surrounding vegetation types. In both North America and
   Europe, however, aspen stands are threatened by a variety of human
   impacts: clear felling, land development, water diversion, fire
   suppression and both wild and domestic ungulate herbivory. We conducted
   a landscape assessment of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) for the
   purpose of identifying key components of resilience. Specifically, we
   tested novel measures linking plant-animal interactions, compared
   crucial functional differences in aspen types and made restorative
   recommendations based on the outcome of these assessments.
   Location
   Book Cliffs region, eastern Utah and western Colorado, USA.
   Methods
   Seventy-seven 1-ha plots were sampled for forest structure, composition,
   regeneration and recruitment, landscape elements, browse level and
   herbivore use. Use was determined by counting the number of pellet
   groups from ungulate species at each sample location. We tested the
   efficacy of a visual stand condition rating system when compared to
   objective metrics. A series of non-parametric analyses were used to
   compare functional aspen types and stand condition groups by key
   variables. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) allowed us to
   explore all our data to find the most critical measures of aspen stand
   conditions for the purpose of better informing future aspen monitoring.
   Results
   Plots differed significantly in seral or stable aspen functional types,
   stand condition rating and browse species use. Ordination analysis
   revealed that regeneration level and herbivore use were the strongest
   objective indicators of aspen stand conditions, while stand condition
   rating proved a valuable subjective index of forest status. While
   ungulate herbivory of aspen is problematic internationally, our results
   show acute impacts where moderate slopes, relatively low water
   availability and intense browsing predominate.
   Conclusions
   Appropriate measures for aspen communities, informed by crucial
   functional divisions, allowed us to gain a clear understanding of
   conditions across this large landscape. Overall, aspen in our study
   landscape is highly vulnerable to collapse due to narrow physiographic
   and climate limitations and browse levels. Without herbivory reduction,
   future conservation in such areas will be strained and widespread system
   failure may occur.}},

Abstract = {{Massive changes to ecosystems sometimes cross thresholds from which
   recovery can be difficult, expensive and slow. These thresholds are
   usually discovered in post hoc analyses long after the event occurred.
   Anticipating these changes prior to their occurrence could give managers
   a chance to intervene. Here we present a novel approach for anticipating
   ecosystem thresholds that combines resilience indicators with Quickest
   detection of change points. Unlike existing methods, the Quickest
   detection method is updated every time a data point arrives, and
   minimizes the time to detect an approaching threshold given the users'
   tolerance for false alarms. The procedure accurately detected an
   impending regime shift in an experimentally manipulated ecosystem. An
   ecosystem model was used to determine if the method can detect an
   approaching threshold soon enough to prevent a regime shift. When the
   monitored variable was directly involved in the interaction that caused
   the regime shift, detection was quick enough to avert collapse. When the
   monitored variable was only indirectly linked to the critical
   transition, detection came too late. The procedure is useful for
   assessing changes in resilience as ecosystems approach thresholds.
   However some thresholds cannot be detected in time to prevent regime
   shifts, and surprises will be inevitable in ecosystem management.}},

Abstract = {{Over 430 alien tree species worldwide are known to be invasive, and the
   list is growing as more tree species are moved around the world and
   become established in novel environments. Alien trees can simultaneously
   bring many benefits and cause substantial environmental harm, very often
   leading to conflicts over how they should be managed. The impacts grow
   over time as invasions spread, and societal perceptions of the value of
   alien trees also change as understanding grows and as values shift. This
   leads to a dynamic environment in which trade-offs are required to
   maximise benefits and minimise harm. The management of alien tree
   populations needs to be strategic and adaptive, combining all possible
   management interventions to promote the sustainable delivery of optimal
   outcomes. We use examples, mainly from South Africa (where issues
   relating to invasive alien trees introduced for forestry have received
   most attention), to argue for holistic and collaborative approaches to
   alien tree management. Such approaches need to include bold steps, such
   as phasing out unsustainable plantation forestry that is based on highly
   invasive species, and in which the costs are externalised. Furthermore,
   it would be advisable to impose much stricter controls on the

   agents on food webs, and by cataloguing that range, we worked towards
   defining the various mechanisms and their specific effects. To explore
   the impact, a direct approach is to study changes in food-web properties
   with infectious agents as separate species in the web, acting as
   additional nodes, with links to their host species. An indirect approach
   concentrates not on adding new nodes and links, but on the ways that
   infectious agents affect the existing links across host and non-host
   nodes, by influencing the `quality' of consumer-resource interaction as
   it depends on the epidemiological state host involved. Both approaches
   are natural from an ecological point of view, but the indirect approach
   may connect more straightforwardly to commonly used tools in infectious
   disease dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{For species with irruptive population behavior, dispersal is an
   important component of outbreak dynamics. We developed and parameterized
   a mechanistic model describing mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus
   ponderosae Hopkins) population demographics and dispersal across a
   landscape. Model components include temperature-dependent phenology,
   host tree colonization determined by an Allee effect, and random-walk
   dispersal with motility conditioned by host tree density. The model was
   parameterized at a study site in central Idaho, United States (US), and
   evaluated at an independent site in northern Washington, US. Phloem and
   air temperatures, MPB spatial impact data from USDA Forest Service
   aerial detection surveys, and remotely sensed host tree density data
   were used to parameterize the model using a maximum likelihood approach.
   At both study sites the model was highly accurate (>84\%) in predicting
   annual pattern formation when the model was re-initiated each year with
   the location of new patches of infested trees. Prediction of annual
   population growth at both sites was also good (>90\%), although the
   model under-predicted area impacted at the Washington site, and at both
   sites was unable to predict initiation of new small patches. Our model
   extends previous research by providing a mechanistic description of the
   link between motility, dispersal and temperature-dependent MPB
   phenology. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Trees are absent from the Arctic Slope of Alaska except for isolated
   stands of balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L., Salicaceae) disjunct by
   over 100 km from the boreal forest south of the Brooks Range. Here, I
   describe balsam poplar plant communities on the Arctic Slope and
   interior Alaska and Yukon. I established 32 releves, used the
   Braun-Blanquet approach to classify balsam poplar communities, and
   applied nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to identify the
   ecological gradients underlying community differentiation. The
   ordination revealed a clear differentiation between arctic and boreal
   communities. Ecological gradients, reflected by ordination axes,
   correspond to a complex productivity gradient and a complex gradient in
   slope angle and aspect. A new order and alliance are described,
   Populetalia balsamiferae and Eurybio-Populion balsamiferae,
   respectively. Within the alliance, two new associations are described:
   (1) Salici alaxensis-Populetum balsamiferae (arctic communities) with
   three variants (typical variant in riparian areas, var. Androsace
   chamaejasme on south-facing slopes and var. Cystopteris montana
   associated with perennial springs), and (2) Rosoacicularis-Populetum
   balsamiferae (boreal communities). In all communities, species richness
   is driven by herbaceous and woody species, which make up 85 \% of the
   total species. Species richness of lichens and mosses is low throughout
   the communities, most likely because of annual flooding in riparian
   sites and shading by the balsam poplar overstory. A comprehensive
   baseline map documenting the current distribution of extralimital stands
   of balsam poplar is presented that significantly expands upon our
   previous knowledge of this species' northern distribution. A strong link
   between summer warmth index (SWI), the sum of mean monthly temperatures
   > 0 degrees C, and the presence of balsam poplar is observed for the
   Arctic Slope (SWI > 25 for 80 \% of the stands). The alteration of
   temperature regimes resulting from global climate change will likely
   lead to an increase in the abundance and distribution of balsam poplar
   in Arctic Alaska.}},

Abstract = {{Major landscape transformations have occurred in the northern
   Mediterranean over the last decades, including urbanization,
   agricultural intensification and land abandonment, which, in turn,
   increase the risk of the propagation of fire. We used repeated-count
   surveys conducted at 369 sites in France and Spain to jointly model the
   effects of environmental covariates on the abundance, occupancy and
   detection of Hermann's tortoise, a long-lived and endangered species,
   using a novel zero-inflated approach. We also employed a large dataset
   of presence-only data collected in Provence to model environmental
   influences on occurrence probability using maximum entropy models. In
   both France and Spain, sites that experienced wildfires over the last 50
   years hosted 31\% fewer individuals than unburned sites. In Provence,
   higher wildfire frequency decreased this species' occurrence
   probability, from 50\% when 0-1 fire had occurred over the last 50
   years, to 7\% in areas that had burned at least 3 times. We also showed
   that abundance required a long recovery time (more than 25 years) after
   wildfires. In Provence, the highest occurrence probability for this
   species was found in patchy landscapes and scrub and/or herbaceous
   vegetation. The lowest species occurrence was found in extensive
   artificial areas, vineyards and arable lands. These results suggest a
   high risk of population extinction in the future if these types of
   habitats continue to expand in plains and coastal areas to the detriment
   of scrublands. Higher wildfire frequency predicted by climate change
   scenarios in the Mediterranean is also likely to increase the risk of

Abstract = {{Intra- and interspecific spatially contagious seed dispersal has
   far-reaching implications for plant recruitment, distribution, and
   community assemblage. However, logistical and analytical limitations
   have curtailed our understanding concerning the mechanisms and resulting
   spatial patterns of contagious seed dispersal in most systems and,
   especially, in complex seed-disperser networks. We investigated
   mechanisms of seed aggregation using techniques of spatial point pattern
   analysis and extensive data sets on mutispecific endozoochorous seed
   rain generated by five frugivorous mammals in three Mediterranean
   shrublands over two seasons. Our novel analytical approach revealed
   three hierarchical and complementary mechanisms of seed aggregation
   acting at different levels (fecal samples, seeds, pairs of seed species)
   and spatial scales. First, the three local guilds of frugivores tended
   to deliver their feces highly aggregated at small and intermediate
   spatial scales, and the overall pattern of fecal delivery could be
   described well by a nested double-cluster Thomas process. Second, once
   the strong observed fecal aggregation was accounted for, the
   distribution of mammal feces containing seeds was clustered within the
   pattern of all feces (i.e., with and without seeds), and the density of
   fecal samples containing seeds was higher than expected around other
   feces containing seeds in two out of the three studied seed-disperser
   networks. Finally, at a finer level, mark correlation analyses revealed
   that for some plant species pairs, the number of dispersed seeds was
   positively associated either at small or large spatial scales. Despite
   the relatively invariant patterning of nested double-clustering, some
   attributes of endozoochorous seed rain (e.g., intensity, scales of
   aggregation) were variable among study sites due to changes in the
   ecological context in which seeds and their dispersers interact. Our
   investigation disentangles for the first time the hierarchy of synergic
   mechanisms of spatially contagious seed dispersal at a range of spatial
   scales in complex seed-disperser networks, thus providing a robust and
   widely applicable framework for future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Plasticity or evolution in behavioural responses are key attributes of
   successful animal invasions. In northern Australia, the invasive cane
   toad (Rhinella marina) recently invaded semi-arid regions. Here, cane
   toads endure repeated daily bouts of severe desiccation and thermal
   stress during the long dry season (April-October). We investigated
   whether cane toads have shifted their ancestral nocturnal rehydration
   behaviour to one that exploits water resources during the day. Such a
   shift in hydration behaviour could increase the fitness of individual
   toads by reducing exposure to desiccation and thermal stress suffered
   during the day even within terrestrial shelters. We used a novel method
   (acoustic tags) to monitor the daily hydration behaviour of 20 toads at
   two artificial reservoirs on Camfield station, Northern Territory.
   Remarkably, cane toads visited reservoirs to rehydrate during daylight
   hours, with peaks in activity between 9.00 and 17.00. This diurnal
   pattern of rehydration activity contrasts with nocturnal rehydration
   behaviour exhibited by adult toads in their native geographical range
   and more mesic parts of Australia. Our results demonstrate that cane

Abstract = {{The area of land occupied by exurban residential development is
   significant and has been increasing over the past several decades in the
   United States. Considerable attention has been drawn to the measurement
   of regional-scale patterns of land-cover change and assessment of its
   environmental and socioeconomic consequences. Yet little is known about
   the quantity of land-cover change within individual exurban residential
   parcels, which reflect homeowner preferences, land-management
   strategies, and the ecosystem services they generate. Similarly, little
   is known about the spatial autocorrelation of land cover among parcels
   and how it may change over time. Using a dataset delineating land-cover
   change within exurban residential parcels in southeastern Michigan from
   1960 to 2000, the quantity and composition of land cover and carbon
   storage are examined. The spatial similarity of land-cover quantity
   among neighboring parcels is evaluated using local indicators of spatial
   association. Results show, among other findings, that (1) the number of
   exurban residential parcels, the quantity of tree cover, and amount of
   carbon storage increased steadily from 1960 to 2000; (2) the
   distribution of parcel sizes remained relatively constant and dominated

   significantly similar to their neighbors; and (4) using a benefits
   transfer approach, new exurban parcels are estimated to store similar to
   15,000-29,000 kg Cover the study period. The measured changes in land
   cover and carbon storage improve our understanding of how ecosystem
   services may change in human-dominated landscapes and provide evidence

Title = {{Lines in the mud; revisiting the boundaries of important shorebird areas}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-67}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Many shorebird populations are declining throughout the world,
   concurrent with declines and degradation of wetland habitats. Such
   declines necessitate a more consistent approach towards conserving
   habitats used by shorebird populations. Individuals of many shorebird
   species congregate in specific areas during their non-breeding season.
   Worldwide, non-breeding areas are designated as Important' for shorebird
   conservation based primarily on the abundance of birds found in an area.
   However, the boundaries of any area are often defined with incomplete
   information regarding how shorebirds use that habitat. This paper
   discusses examples in Australia where improved knowledge of shorebird
   habitat use led to the identification of very different boundaries of
   important shorebird areas than those identified originally. We highlight
   how simple questioning of those who count shorebirds in an area, led to
   an improved understanding of which areas were apparently used by the
   same local population of non-breeding shorebirds. Subsequent analysis of
   available count, recapture and/or home range data of particular
   shorebird species is needed to verify expert opinion regarding most of
   these boundaries. We review how enhanced boundaries improve the ability
   of shorebird monitoring to detect population changes; allow management
   of shorebird habitats at relevant spatial scales; and lead to
   appropriate designations of important areas. While the kinds of
   approaches to boundary setting described here are not new, they are not
   consistently applied worldwide. We suggest additional guidelines to
   those produced under the Ramsar Convention in regard to designating
   important areas. We also call for more studies on the movements of
   migratory shorebirds during the non-breeding season to direct more
   consistent boundary setting around important non-breeding habitats used
   by local populations of migratory shorebirds. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

Volume = {{185}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-50}},

Abstract = {{The federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis
   caurina) is the focus of intensive conservation efforts that have led to
   much forested land being reserved as habitat for the owl and associated
   wildlife species throughout the Pacific Northwest of the United States.
   Recently, however, a relatively new threat to spotted owls has emerged
   in the form of an invasive competitor: the congeneric barred owl (S.
   varia). As barred owls have rapidly expanded their populations into the
   entire range of the northern spotted owl, mounting evidence indicates
   that they are displacing, hybridizing with, and even killing spotted
   owls. The range expansion by barred owls into western North America has
   made an already complex conservation issue even more contentious, and a
   lack of information on the ecological relationships between the 2
   species has hampered recovery efforts for northern spotted owls. We
   investigated spatial relationships, habitat use, diets, survival, and
   reproduction of sympatric spotted owls and barred owls in western
   Oregon, USA, during 2007-2009. Our overall objective was to determine
   the potential for and possible consequences of competition for space,
   habitat, and food between these previously allopatric owl species. Our
   study included 29 spotted owls and 28 barred owls that were radio-marked
   in 36 neighboring territories and monitored over a 24-month period.
   Based on repeated surveys of both species, the number of territories
   occupied by pairs of barred owls in the 745-km(2) study area (82)
   greatly outnumbered those occupied by pairs of spotted owls (15).
   Estimates of mean size of home ranges and core-use areas of spotted owls
   (1,843ha and 305ha, respectively) were 2-4 times larger than those of
   barred owls (581ha and 188ha, respectively). Individual spotted and
   barred owls in adjacent territories often had overlapping home ranges,
   but interspecific space sharing was largely restricted to broader
   foraging areas in the home range with minimal spatial overlap among
   core-use areas. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank
   discrete-choice models representing alternative hypotheses about the
   influence of forest conditions, topography, and interspecific
   interactions on species-specific patterns of nighttime resource
   selection. Spotted owls spent a disproportionate amount of time foraging
   on steep slopes in ravines dominated by old (>120 yr) conifer trees.
   Barred owls used available forest types more evenly than spotted owls,
   and were most strongly associated with patches of large hardwood and
   conifer trees that occupied relatively flat areas along streams. Spotted
   and barred owls differed in the relative use of old conifer forest
   (greater for spotted owls) and slope conditions (steeper slopes for
   spotted owls), but we found no evidence that the 2 species differed in
   their use of young, mature, and riparian-hardwood forest types. Mean
   overlap in proportional use of different forest types between individual
   spotted owls and barred owls in adjacent territories was 81\%
   (range=30-99\%). The best model of habitat use for spotted owls
   indicated that the relative probability of a location being used was
   substantially reduced if the location was within or in close proximity
   to a core-use area of a barred owl. We used pellet analysis and measures
   of food-niche overlap to determine the potential for dietary competition
   between spatially associated pairs of spotted owls and barred owls.
   We identified 1,223 prey items from 15 territories occupied by spotted
   owls and 4,299 prey items from 24 territories occupied by barred owls.
   Diets of both species were dominated by nocturnal mammals, but diets of
   barred owls included many terrestrial, aquatic, and diurnal prey species
   that were rare or absent in diets of spotted owls. Northern flying
   squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus), woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes, N. cinerea),
   and lagomorphs (Lepus americanus, Sylvilagus bachmani) were primary prey
   for both owl species, accounting for 81\% and 49\% of total dietary
   biomass for spotted owls and barred owls, respectively. Mean dietary
   overlap between pairs of spotted and barred owls in adjacent territories
   was moderate (42\%; range=28-70\%). Barred owls displayed demographic
   superiority over spotted owls; annual survival probability of spotted
   owls from known-fate analyses (0.81, SE=0.05) was lower than that of
   barred owls (0.92, SE=0.04), and pairs of barred owls produced an
   average of 4.4 times more young than pairs of spotted owls over a 3-year
   period. We found a strong, positive relationship between seasonal
   (6-month) survival probabilities of both species and the proportion of
   old (>120 yr) conifer forest within individual home ranges, which
   suggested that availability of old forest was a potential limiting
   factor in the competitive relationship between these 2 species. The
   annual number of young produced by spotted owls increased linearly with
   increasing distance from a territory center of a pair of barred owls,
   and all spotted owls that attempted to nest within 1.5km of a nest used
   by barred owls failed to successfully produce young. We identified
   strong associations between the presence of barred owls and the behavior
   and fitness potential of spotted owls, as shown by changes in movements,
   habitat use, and reproductive output of spotted owls exposed to
   different levels of spatial overlap with territorial barred owls. When
   viewed collectively, our results support the hypothesis that
   interference competition with barred owls for territorial space can
   constrain the availability of critical resources required for successful
   recruitment and reproduction of spotted owls. Availability of old
   forests and associated prey species appeared to be the most strongly
   limiting factors in the competitive relationship between these species,
   indicating that further loss of these conditions can lead to increases
   in competitive pressure. Our findings have broad implications for the
   conservation of spotted owls, as they suggest that spatial heterogeneity
   in vital rates may not arise solely because of differences among
   territories in the quality or abundance of forest habitat, but also
   because of the spatial distribution of a newly established competitor.
   Experimental removal of barred owls could be used to test this
   hypothesis and determine whether localized control of barred owl numbers
   is an ecologically practical and socio-politically acceptable management
   tool to consider in conservation strategies for spotted owls. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Although invasion risk is expected to increase with propagule pressure
   (PP), it is unclear whether PP-invasibility relationships follow an
   asymptotic or some other non-linear form and whether such relationships
   vary with underlying environmental conditions. Using manipulations of
   PP, soil fertility and disturbance, we tested how each influence
   PP-invasibility relationships for Lespedeza cuneata in a Kansas

   may contribute to plant invasions. After three growing seasons, we found
   that the PP-invasibility relationships best fit an asymptotic model of
   invasion reflecting a combination of density-independent and
   density-dependent processes and that seeds were aggregated within the
   plant community despite efforts to uniformly sow seeds. Consistent with
   some models, community invasibility decreased with enhanced soil
   fertility or reduced levels of disturbance in response to changes in the
   fraction of safe sites. Our results illustrate that disturbance and soil
   fertility can be a useful organizing principle for predicting community
   invasibility, asymptotic models are a reasonable starting point for
   modeling invasion, and new modeling techniques-coupled with classic
   experimental approaches-can enhance our understanding of the invasion

Abstract = {{Groundwater-fed calcareous wetlands (fens) support diverse plant

   differences in average soil temperatures were observed between
   monitoring locations during a 161 day period in 2010 (range: 14.5 to
   20.0 A degrees C). Using a regression approach, we developed accurate
   daily resolution soil temperature models (min and max) from a 29-sensor
   network by integrating atmospheric and hydrologic terms. Models
   accurately predicted validation observations from an independent
   17-sensor network (R-2 values 0.92 minimums; 0.95 maximums) with low
   error compared to null models. Environmental variation in seasonal
   average soil temperature, snow depth, specific conductance, canopy
   closure, and non-vascular plant cover were correlated with spatial
   patterns in vascular plant community composition. Results of plant

Abstract = {{1. Lotic ecosystems worldwide are being increasingly modified
   hydromorphologically, for example, by damming, fragmentation, flow
   regulation and channel modification. Serious threats to riverine
   biodiversity are suspected, yet available field data are few and rarely
   address the various taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic components of
   biodiversity.
   2. We examined benthic macroinvertebrate diversity along a gradient of
   hydromorphological alteration across 65 lowland river sites in the
   Netherlands, Germany and Poland. We calculated eight metrics describing
   taxonomic diversity (richness, rarefied richness, Shannon's and
   Simpson's diversity, Pielou's evenness), functional diversity (mean
   trait diversity) and phylogenetic diversity (mean taxonomic distinctness
   and its variance).
   3. Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) and Non-metric
   Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) showed detailed changes in taxonomic and
   trait composition, respectively, with increasing hydromorphological
   alteration. TITAN revealed a gradual turnover under increasing impact in
   which taxon losses were almost balanced by gains. NMS illustrated a high
   degree of concordance in the traits possessed by the taxa lost and
   gained at the gradient's end points.
   4. Although a biologically meaningful hydromorphological gradient was
   evident, the biodiversity response was modest (Spearman's <|0.32| for
   all metrics). Pielou's evenness and mean taxonomic distinctness actually
   increased at impaired sites.
   5. Our results suggest that taxonomic and trait replacement with
   hydromorphological alteration is not followed by changes in
   whole-community diversity. This implies some redundancy in these
   systems, with ecologically similar species replacing those lost through
   environmental change.
   6. The results highlight how whole-community-based diversity, although
   frequently calculated and interpreted for decades in ecology and
   conservation biology, is not the all-purpose concept to detect and
   assess the various facets of biodiversity loss. Therefore, we suggest
   that concerted effort is needed to develop and test novel indicators of
   biodiversity, capable of detecting biodiversity loss, or other changes,
   in response to the main environmental stressors of lotic ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid urbanization and industrialization accelerate economic
   development, but have a negative influence on environments. The aim of
   this study is to attempt to handle the relationships properly between
   them, a hot topic all over the world. Based on the reviews of land
   allocation and the previous research on ecological storage, this paper
   takes both economic and ecological considerations into account in the
   framework design of land allocation model, and then proposes Primary
   Development and Secondary Optimization Model for Land Allocation
   (PDSO-LA model), together with a series of other models/approaches for
   judgment, analysis and test. The model follows the past, present and
   future land use and ecosystems and sets up relevant constraints, but
   more emphasizes the trade-offs within and between structural and
   functional ecological storage. Especially, this study gives a new trial
   idea and approach to estimate the converted equivalents for balanced
   individual functions-orientated sub-ecosystems in the modeled part for
   secondary optimization. In order to verify the availability and
   practicability of PDSO-LA model, this paper takes Wu'an as a case study
   and makes sufficient investigations. The results show that the volumes
   of structural ecological storage after allocation in 2010 and 2020 will
   reach 5865.24 RMB/ha and 6096.21 RMB/ha, in a rising trend, and its
   orderly change will be enhanced; in contrast, though land allocation
   cannot basically change the disorder trend for functional ecological
   storage, the intensity of disorder can be mitigated by using PDSO-LA
   model. Thus, it is concluded that PDSO-LA model can effectively improve
   or at least mitigate the disorder of trade-offs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{New and old mosquito-borne diseases have emerged and re-emerged in
   temperate regions over the recent past, but a mechanistic understanding
   of mosquito population dynamics, a fundamental step toward disease
   control, remains elusive. We propose here a Gompertz-based approach to
   address two obstacles to the development of vector dynamics models in
   temperate regions: (i) the inclusion of endogenous processes (e.g.
   density limitation, delayed responses, etc.) and the evaluation of their
   relative importance vs. exogenous environmental forcings; (ii) the
   inclusion of realistic descriptions of hydrologic processes and the
   evaluation of soil moisture as a more direct driver of mosquito
   population dynamics. The new model is based on a hierarchical
   state-space structure and is applied to the description of the abundance
   of Culex pipiens - a West Nile Virus vector - in the Po River Delta
   region (Northeastern Italy), using weekly mosquito abundance
   observations at more than 20 sites in the period May-September in 2010
   and 2011. The hierarchical structure provides an efficient way of fully
   exploiting the information from a large network of observation sites. We
   find that Cx. pipiens abundance has significant density dependence at
   the one-week scale, which is coherent with its larval developmental time
   during the summer. This result points to the importance of endogenous
   population dynamics, most often neglected in mosquito population models,
   usually simply driven by exogenous environmental forcings. Among
   exogenous controls, temperature, daylight hours, and soil moisture were
   found to be most influential. Use of precipitation or soil moisture to
   force the model leads to very similar predictive skills. The negative
   correlation of soil moisture and mosquito population may be attributed
   to the abundance of water in the region (e.g. due to irrigation) and the
   preference for eutrophic habitats by Cx. pipiens. Variations among sites
   were highly correlated with land-use factors. The carrying capacity is
   seen to decrease with the distance to the nearest rice field, while the
   maximum population growth rate was positively related with the
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, a proxy of vegetation cover. The
   model shows a satisfactory performance in explaining the variation of
   mosquito abundance over a horizon of 1 week, particularly as far as peak
   timing and magnitude are concerned. Large rates of change of population
   abundance remain difficult to predict, as in other existing models,
   pointing to persisting gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms
   regulating mosquito population dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Assessing the uncertainties in the estimates obtained from forest carbon
   budget models used for national and international reporting is
   essential, but model evaluations are rarely conducted mainly because of
   lack of appropriate, independent ground plot data sets. Ecosystem carbon
   stock estimates for 696 ground plots from Canada's new National Forest
   Inventory enabled the assessment of carbon stocks predicted by the
   Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector 3 (CBM-CFS3). This
   model uses country-specific parameters, incorporates all five ecosystem
   carbon pools, and uses a simulation-based approach to predict ecosystem
   C stocks from forest inventory data to implement a Tier-3 (most complex)
   approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Good Practice
   Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC-GPG). The
   model is at the core of Canada's National Forest Carbon Monitoring,
   Accounting, and Reporting System (NFCMARS). The set of ground plots
   meets the IPCC-GPG standard for model evaluation as it is entirely
   independent of the model, but similar in type to that required for IPCC
   Tier-3 inventory-based C stock estimation. Model simulations for each
   ground plot used only the type of input data available to the NFCMARS
   for the national inventory report in 2010 and none of the model's
   default parameters were altered. Ecosystem total C stocks estimated by
   CBM-CFS3 were unbiased (mean difference = 1.9 Mg ha(-1), p = 0.397), and
   significantly correlated (r = 0.54, p = 0.000) with ground plot-based
   estimates. Contribution to ecosystem total C stocks error from soil was
   large, and from deadwood and aboveground biomass small. Results for
   percent error in the aboveground biomass (7.5\%) and IPCC defined
   deadwood (30.8\%) pools compared favourably to the IPCC-GPG standards of
   8\% and 30\%, respectively. Thus, we concluded that the CBM-CFS3 is
   reliable for reporting of C stocks in Canada's national greenhouse gas
   inventories. However, available standards for judging model reliability
   are few, and here we provide recommendations for the development of
   practical standards. Analyses by leading species (n = 16) showed that
   error could often be attributed to a small subset of species and/or
   pools, allowing us to identify where improvements of input data and/or
   the model would most contribute to reducing uncertainties. This C stock
   comparison is one of the first ever to follow the evaluation process
   recommended by the IPCC-GPG for a Tier-3 model, and is a first step
   towards verification of greenhouse gas emission and removal estimates
   based on C stock changes. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Forest ecosystems are characterized by high spatial heterogeneity, often
   related to complex composition and vertical structure which is a
   challenge in many process-based models. The need to expand process-based
   models (PBMs) to take in account such structural complexity led to
   development and testing of a new approach into Forest Ecosystem Models
   (FEMs), named 3D-CMCC-FEM, able to investigate carbon and water fluxes,
   including biomass pools and their partitioning, for complex multi-layer
   forests. 3D-CMCC FEM integrates several characteristics of the
   functional structural tree models and the robustness of the light use
   efficiency CLUE) approach to investigate forest growth patterns and
   yield processes. The modelling approach was tested by simulating the
   effects of competition for light and water, growth and yield of a
   two-layered deciduous forest dominated by Turkey Oak in central Italy
   for a period of eight years. The model outputs were validated against a
   series of independently measured data for the major biomass pools, the
   inter-annual stem increments and above-ground net primary productivity
   of the overstorey and understorey, respectively. The comparison of Leaf
   Area Index, Gross Primary Production, and evapotranspiration produced by
   the model against MODIS data showed agreement in results. In addition,
   the multi-layered model approach was evaluated against a series of
   simplified versions to determine whether the enhanced complexity of the
   model positively contributed to its predictive ability. The proposed
   model reduced the error in the estimates of forest productivity (e.g.
   NPP) and dynamics (e.g. growth, mortality) and indicates the importance
   of considering, as far as possible, the structural complexity in PBMs.

   Goal: To investigate differences in morphological plasticity in

   Organism: Pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus).
   Methods: Fish were reared for 80 days in enclosures that restricted
   individuals to either the littoral or pelagic zone of an artificial

   intra-population differences were tested using analysis of covariance
   and discriminant function analysis, while differences in plasticity were
   tested through a multivariate analysis of variance of discriminant

   Results: Regardless of geographic origin, fish held under pelagic
   conditions exhibited significantly wider caudal fin bases, and longer
   dorsal and ventral caudal peduncle lengths. All populations developed
   longer gill rakers and shorter and narrower jaw structures when held
   under pelagic conditions. Iberian populations exhibited less phenotypic
   plasticity than native Canadian populations. All pumpkinseed populations
   held under pelagic conditions appear to exhibit similar morphological

Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{45-61}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is expected to alter the geographic distribution and
   abundance of many species, to increase the invasion of new areas by
   exotic species and, in some cases, to lead to species extinction. This
   chapter reviews some of the links between invasive insects and climate
   change. The effects of climate change on insect pest populations can be
   direct, through impacts on their physiology and behaviour, or indirect,
   through biotic interactions (i.e. bottom-up and top-down effects).
   Anthropogenic climate and global change is expected to be a major driver
   in the introduction, establishment, distribution, impact and changes in
   the efficacy of mitigation strategies for invasive species. To address
   these problems, we must be able to predict climate change impacts on
   species distribution and abundance. Commonly used ecological niche model
   ling approaches have implicit assumptions about the biology of the
   target species and attempt to characterize the ecological niche using
   aggregate weather and other factors in the area of recorded
   distribution. More holistic physiologically based demographic modelling
   approaches explicitly describe the biological and physiological
   responses of species to weather and the species they interact with on
   fine temporal and spatial scales. The geographic distribution and
   relative abundance of four invasive insect pests are reviewed under
   observed and +2 degrees C weather scenarios across the USA and Mexico:
   the tropical New World screwworm, the pink bollworm, the Mediterranean
   fruit fly (i.e. medfly) and the olive fly. The distribution of the olive
   fly is examined across the Mediterranean basin to illustrate the
   transferability of the model to analyses of new regions and climate
   change scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 50 years, considerable effort has been made by state and

   programmes include the USDA-Carolinas Witchweed Eradication Program in
   the USA and the Kochia Eradication Project in Western Australia (EDRR
   1.0). In recent years, state inter-agency councils and task forces have
   been formed to address all types of new invasive species - particularly
   newly introduced species that are not already regulated by federal or
   state agencies. The Delaware Invasive Species Council, the Ontario
   Invasive Plant Council and the Beach Vitex Task Force are good examples
   of this new trend in inter-agency partnering (EDRR 2.0). The landscape
   approach to EDRR involves the development of EDRR capacity at all levels
   of the landscape - local to national. It includes individual public and
   private land units, geographic land units (watersheds, biomes,
   corridors, etc.) and political land units (towns, counties,
   states/provinces and nations) (EDRR 3.0). From a societal standpoint,
   due to global climate change and increased global trade and travel, it
   is important to emphasize that the impacts of invasive species on food
   security, human health, and biodiversity will continue to increase
   unless steps are taken now to minimize their introduction, establishment

Title = {{Remote sensing can locate and assess the changing abundance of
   hollow-bearing trees for wildlife in Australian native forests}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{703-716}},
Abstract = {{Context. Hollow-bearing trees are an important breeding and shelter
   resource for wildlife in Australian native forests and hollow
   availability can influence species abundance and diversity in forest
   ecosystems. A persistent problem for forest managers is the ability to
   locate and survey hollow-bearing trees with a high level of accuracy at
   low cost over large areas of forest.
   Aims. The aim of this study was to determine whether remote-sensing
   techniques could identify key variables useful in classifying the
   likelihood of a tree to contain hollows suitable for wildlife.
   Methods. The data were high-resolution, multispectral aerial imagery and
   light detection and ranging (Lidar). A ground-based survey of 194 trees,
   96 Eucalyptus crebra and 98 E. chloroclada and E. blakelyi, were used to
   train and validate tree-senescence classification models.
   Key results. We found that trees in the youngest stage of tree
   senescence, which had a very low probability of hollow occurrence, could
   be distinguished using multispectral aerial imagery from trees in the
   later stages of tree senescence, which had a high probability of hollow
   occurrence. Independently, the canopy-height model used to estimate
   crown foliage density demonstrated the potential of Lidar-derived
   structural parameters as predictors of senescence and the hollow-bearing
   status of individual trees.
   Conclusions. This study demonstrated a `proof of concept' that remotely
   sensed tree parameters are suitable predictor variables for the
   hollow-bearing status of an individual tree.
   Implications. Distinguishing early stage senescence trees from
   later-stage senescence trees using remote sensing offers potential as an
   efficient, repeatable and cost-effective way to map the distribution and
   abundance of hollow-bearing trees across the landscape. Further
   development is required to automate this process across the landscape,
   particularly the delineation of tree crowns. Further improvements may be
   obtained using a combination of these remote-sensing techniques. This
   information has important applications in commercial forest inventory
   and in biodiversity monitoring programs.}},

   individuals per km(2) (s.e.=0.23) in breeding/nesting to 16.02
   individuals per km(2) (s.e.=0.34) in post-molt II. The 95\% bivariate
   normal home-range radii ranged from 2.60 to 3.86km for males and from
   1.90 to 3.15km for females and female home ranges were smaller than
   those of male geese during the breeding/nesting and post-molt II
   seasons. Apparent monthly survival across the study was high, ranging
   from 0.972 (s.e.=0.005) to 0.995 (s.e.=0.002).
   Conclusions By using spatial mark-resight models, we determined that
   Canada goose density estimates varied seasonally. Nevertheless, the
   seasonal changes in density are reflective of the seasonal changes in
   behaviour and physiological requirements of geese.
   Implications Although defining the state-space of spatial mark-resight
   models requires careful consideration, the technique represents a
   promising new tool to estimate and monitor the density of free-ranging
   wildlife. Spatial mark-resight methods provide managers with
   statistically robust population estimates and allow insight into animal
   space use without the need to employ more costly methods (e.g.
   telemetry). Also, when repeated across seasons or other biologically
   important time periods, spatial mark-resight modelling techniques allow
   for inference about apparent survival.}},

Title = {{The limitations of inferring decision rule use from individuals'
   sampling behaviour: a computational test of old and new algorithms}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{179-194}},
Abstract = {{Background: The foraging and mate choices of individuals depend on how
   individuals gather information about available options and use that
   information to make decisions. Several alternative decision rules have
   been proposed, but little progress has been made in using observations
   of behaviour to discover what decision rule is being used. An important
   approach has been to combine the rules into an algorithm that chooses
   between them ('the prevailing algorithm').
   Question: How accurately does the prevailing algorithm classify which
   decision rule is most likely to produce observed sequences of
   individuals choosing one item from a pool of many? Can we create better
   algorithms?
   Methods: Using computer simulations, we construct sampling sequences
   that follow the threshold, best-of-n, and comparative Bayes rules. We
   vary sampling cost, pool size, signal variance, and population variance.
   We mimic sequences seen in nature and avoid parameter values in which
   individuals sample infinitely or not at all. We apply the prevailing
   algorithm to determine which rule created each sequence, and measure its
   probability of success. We use a recursive partitioning exercise to
   produce two new algorithms: one based on individuals' sampling
   sequences, and one based on the population's averaged metrics. We
   compare the performances of these two new algorithms and the prevailing
   algorithm. Finally, we apply all three algorithms to previously
   published empirical data sets.
   Conclusions: The prevailing algorithm did no better than a random
   classification, but the individual algorithm had 64\% success and the
   population algorithm had 97\% success. The latter also succeeded in
   identifying the predominant rule even if different individuals of the
   group had different rules. The population algorithm can reliably infer
   what rule the majority of a population is using. However, using observed
   sequences to infer the decision rule of an individual is unreliable.}},

Abstract = {{Communities of Alaska's North Slope face increased stresses from
   cumulative effects of industrial development, resource use, and changing

   pressures, what avenues exist for citizens and decision makers to
   exchange knowledge about impacts of oil resource extraction in Alaska,
   and how do the successes and failures of knowledge exchange affect the
   resilience of the local social ecological system? We focused our
   research on the risk management process of Alaska North Slope oil
   resources, drawing on literature that has grown out of the risk society
   thesis and concepts of resilience science. We surveyed state and federal
   initiatives designed to increase local and indigenous stakeholder
   engagement in science and policy issues because such guidelines and
   regulations impact on the abilities of local peoples and communities to
   adapt sustainability strategies. Perceived risks and desired outcomes of
   stakeholders on the front lines of climate change and resource
   development should inform regulations that aim to anticipate future
   impacts and needed adaptation strategies. Integration of local values
   and perceptions in an adaptive risk management approach is fundamental
   in resilience-based ecosystem stewardship. The three case studies we
   have presented show that current provisions fail to equitably include
   the local and indigenous knowledge of Alaska's North Slope Borough

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean region is of fundamental importance to Europe given
   its strategic position. The responsibility for its overall ecosystem
   integrity is shared by European Union Member States (EU-MS) and other
   Mediterranean countries. A juxtaposition of overlapping governance
   instruments occurred recently in the region, with the implementation of
   both the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) for EU-MS and the
   Ecosystem Approach Strategy (ECAP) for all Mediterranean countries,

   processes to achieve Good Environmental Status and a Healthy

   of these instruments, especially those related to the new EU-MS

   addition to the well-known economic gap between the EU and the non-EU
   political blocs. We identify two complementary requirements for
   effective implementation of both MSFD and ECAP that could work together
   to reduce this gap, to ensure a better alignment between MSFD and ECAP

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The population of Dublin City and its suburbs currently stands at 1.3
   million and is projected to reach 2.1 million by 2022. There is pressure
   on its water supply system (inadequate catchment sources, ageing
   infrastructure including treatment facilities, and distribution network)
   with little or no spare capacity despite Ireland's relatively high
   rainfall that is well distributed throughout the year; albeit the
   greatest rainfall occurs in the west and southwest and at some remove
   from Dublin. The current governance approach to addressing the projected
   water supply deficit relies heavily on a combination of identifying new
   supply sources to secure the long-term water supply needs of the city
   together with an intense drive toward achieving ``demand-side{''}
   reduced usage and conservation targets in accordance with EU benchmarks
   for various individual and sectoral users. This potentially emerging
   crisis of water scarcity in Dublin, with drivers including population
   growth, greater industrial and institutional demands, migration, and
   climate change, has generated one of the most significant public water
   works projects proposed in Irish history, which is to abstract raw water
   from the Shannon River Basin in the midland region and, following
   treatment, pump it to a storage reservoir in a cut-away bog before
   piping to the Greater Dublin Area. The preparations for this scheme have
   brought to the forefront some longstanding Irish water resources
   governance issues and challenges. This provides a unique opportunity and
   imperative at this time to take a more comprehensive look at the
   decision-making process in this regard, one done in the context of new
   European and national policies requiring incorporation of integrated
   planning to sustain ecosystem services, water resources management,
   water services management, and flood defense principles, and one taking
   account of the current unprecedented state of flux in which water

Abstract = {{Shallow, vegetated habitats play an important role as spawning and

   two quantitative methods for sampling of young fishes in shallow

   conducted in the littoral zone of an archipelago area in Lake Vanern,
   Sweden. Both methods rendered quantitative estimates on the most common

   lower variation among samples. These differences are likely due to the
   larger sample area of detonations. Species distribution and juvenile
   fish density estimates and size-structure were compared with results
   from multi-mesh gill nets. The dominant fish species in the gill net
   program were recorded with both active methods although the relative
   composition differed, mainly as a consequence of differences in species
   and size selectivity. Detonations provided additional, small-bodied,
   species that were not recorded in the gill net program. Quantitative

Abstract = {{The European Water Framework Directive, which came into force in 2000,
   introduced a system of river basin management which required member
   states to develop a range of new biological assessment systems to
   determine the status of Europe's surface waters. Member states were free
   to use existing methods or to develop new ones, which resulted in a
   large number of methods being used across Europe. To ensure the
   comparability of the resulting assessments, these states were required
   to compare their methods to demonstrate that the boundary criteria they
   established represented similar levels of ecological change. Although it
   is desirable to align status class boundaries to significant changes of
   ecological status, so that the resulting classifications can be linked
   to ecosystem function, many methods simply divide status into five equal
   classes along a pressure gradient. An exception was the approach used
   for lakes, where a greater understanding of the impacts of
   eutrophication has been established. Here, boundaries were derived from
   the likelihood of undesirable disturbances caused by the secondary
   impacts of eutrophication. The Water Framework Directive has now been in
   force for twelve years, new monitoring systems have been developed and
   management plans have been adopted. While it is unlikely that the aim of
   achieving good ecological status can be achieved in the majority of
   surface waters by 2015, the default target established by the directive,
   good progress is being made and Europe is on the path to establishing a
   sustainable future for its water environment.}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{6341-6354}},
Abstract = {{It is generally known that the interplay between the carbon and
   nutrients supplied from subsurface waters via biological metabolism
   determines the CO2 fluxes in upwelling systems. However,
   quantificational assessment of such interplay is difficult because of
   the dynamic nature of both upwelling circulation and the associated
   biogeochemistry. We recently proposed a new framework, the
   Ocean-dominated Margin (OceMar), for semi-quantitatively diagnosing the
   CO2 source/sink nature of an ocean margin over a given period of time,
   highlighting that the relative consumption between carbon and nutrients
   determines if carbon is in excess (i.e., CO2 source) or in deficit
   (i.e., CO2 sink) in the upper waters of ocean margins relative to their
   off-site inputs from the adjacent open ocean. In the present study, such
   a diagnostic approach based upon both couplings of
   physics-biogeochemistry and carbon-nutrients was applied to resolve the
   CO2 fluxes in the well-known upwelling system off Oregon and northern
   California of the US west coast, using data collected along three
   cross-shelf transects from the inner shelf to the open basin in
   spring/early summer 2007. Through examining the biological consumption
   on top of the water mass mixing revealed by the total
   alkalinity-salinity relationship, we successfully predicted and
   semi-analytically resolved the CO2 fluxes showing strong uptake from the
   atmosphere beyond the nearshore regions. This CO2 sink nature primarily
   resulted from the higher utilization of nutrients relative to dissolved
   inorganic carbon (DIC) based on their concurrent inputs from the depth.
   On the other hand, the biological responses to intensified upwelling
   were minor in nearshore waters off the Oregon-California coast, where
   significant CO2 outgassing was observed during the sampling period and
   resolving CO2 fluxes could be simplified without considering
   DIC/nutrient consumption, i.e., decoupling between upwelling and
   biological consumption. We reasoned that coupling physics and
   biogeochemistry in the OceMar model would assume a steady state with
   balanced DIC and nutrients via both physical transport and biological
   alterations in comparable timescales.}},

   size sieves], the grouping has become recognised as a distinct
   ecological category, important by its major contribution to benthic
   metabolism and secondary production. While marine ecological research
   usually addresses entire meiobenthic communities considered as
   assemblages of interacting components represented by high-rank taxonomic
   units called the major taxa (phyla, orders, families), there is a
   general awareness of an immense taxonomic richness (diversity) those
   taxa represent. Whenever detailed taxonomic studies on the meiobenthos
   have been carried out, a great number of new species, genera and
   higher-rank taxa has been described. However, the knowledge of this
   diversity, particularly in the deep sea, is still greatly limited.
   Ecological research on the meiobenthos revealed the grouping to be a
   sensitive indicator of environmental changes. Consequently, the
   meiobenthos is being increasingly frequently used in monitoring and
   evaluating impacts of factors that disturb the natural state of
   sedimentary environment. The reliability of such evaluations may be
   enhanced by refining the resolution of taxonomic analyses and by
   coupling them with information on functional traits of the meiobenthic
   taxa present in an assemblage. While such approach is gaining popularity
   in research on coastal areas, it is still very rare in the deep sea,
   although the meiobenthos-related variables have been used in evaluating
   impacts in the deep sea.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{203-215}},
Abstract = {{A high-resolution 3D biophysical model was used to investigate the
   patterns of larval transport for an important commercial and
   recreational temperate fish, snapper Pagrus auratus, from a
   well-established marine reserve (Cape Rodney to Okakari Point marine
   reserve, CROP), and spawning ground. Our focus was to study the effects
   of local hydrodynamics, contrasting larval vertical behaviours and
   changing El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles (via their effect on
   wind forcing) on the potential larval supply to adjacent non-protected
   areas. The model suggests the CROP marine reserve provides significant
   larval subsidies within a relatively small scale (<= 40 km), the details
   of which depend on larval behaviour and ENSO patterns. Changing ENSO
   patterns mostly affected the dispersal direction of larvae, while larval
   behaviour was a strong driver only under La Nina conditions. Modelling
   suggests that under El Nino conditions, snapper larvae are more likely
   to settle successfully and hence make a strong contribution to
   surrounding fished stocks. Understanding the contribution of MPAs to
   fisheries management will require multiple approaches. Modelling will
   help identify the strength of contributing physical and biological
   factors, and in due course enable site-and time-specific examples of

Pages = {{5269-5283}},
Abstract = {{The impacts of changes in ozone precursor emissions as well as climate
   change on the future ozone exposure of the vegetation in Europe were
   investigated. The ozone exposure is expressed as AOT40 (Accumulated
   exposure Over a Threshold of 40 ppb O-3) as well as PODY (Phytotoxic
   Ozone Dose above a threshold Y). A new method is suggested to express
   how the length of the period during the year when coniferous and
   evergreen trees are sensitive to ozone might be affected by climate
   change. Ozone precursor emission changes from the RCP4.5 scenario were
   combined with climate simulations based on the IPCC SRES A1B scenario
   and used as input to the Eulerian Chemistry Transport Model MATCH from
   which projections of ozone concentrations were derived. The ozone
   exposure of vegetation over Europe expressed as AOT40 was projected to
   be substantially reduced between the periods 1990-2009 and 2040-2059 to
   levels which are well below critical levels used for vegetation in the
   EU directive 2008/50/EC as well as for crops and forests used in the
   LRTAP convention, despite that the future climate resulted in prolonged
   yearly ozone sensitive periods. The reduction in AOT40 was mainly driven
   by the emission reductions, not changes in the climate. For the
   toxicologically more relevant POD1 index the projected reductions were
   smaller, but still significant. The values for POD1 for the time period
   2040-2059 were not projected to decrease to levels which are below
   critical levels for forest trees, represented by Norway spruce. This
   study shows that substantial reductions of ozone precursor emissions
   have the potential to strongly reduce the future risk for ozone effects
   on the European vegetation, even if concurrent climate change promotes

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{5285-5306}},
Abstract = {{This paper reviews progress on understanding biological carbon
   sequestration in the ocean with special reference to the microbial
   formation and transformation of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon
   (RDOC), the microbial carbon pump (MCP). We propose that RDOC is a
   concept with a wide continuum of recalcitrance. Most RDOC compounds
   maintain their levels of recalcitrance only in a specific environmental
   context (RDOCt). The ocean RDOC pool also contains compounds that may be
   inaccessible to microbes due to their extremely low concentration
   (RDOCc). This differentiation allows us to appreciate the linkage
   between microbial source and RDOC composition on a range of temporal and
   spatial scales.
   Analyses of biomarkers and isotopic records show intensive MCP processes
   in the Proterozoic oceans when the MCP could have played a significant
   role in regulating climate. Understanding the dynamics of the MCP in
   conjunction with the better constrained biological pump (BP) over
   geological timescales could help to predict future climate trends.
   Integration of the MCP and the BP will require new research approaches
   and opportunities. Major goals include understanding the interactions
   between particulate organic carbon (POC) and RDOC that contribute to
   sequestration efficiency, and the concurrent determination of the
   chemical composition of organic carbon, microbial community composition
   and enzymatic activity. Molecular biomarkers and isotopic tracers should
   be employed to link water column processes to sediment records, as well
   as to link present-day observations to paleo-evolution. Ecosystem models
   need to be developed based on empirical relationships derived from
   bioassay experiments and field investigations in order to predict the
   dynamics of carbon cycling along the stability continuum of POC and RDOC

Abstract = {{A massive diatom bloom is observed each year in the surface waters of
   the naturally Fe-fertilized Kerguelen Plateau (Southern Ocean). We
   measured biogenic silica production and dissolution fluxes (rho Si and
   rho Diss, respectively) in the mixed layer in the vicinity of the
   Kerguelen Plateau during austral spring 2011 (KEOPS-2 cruise). We
   compare results from a high-nutrient low-chlorophyll reference station
   and stations with different degrees of iron enrichment and bloom
   conditions. Above the plateau biogenic rho Si are among the highest
   reported so far in the Southern Ocean (up to 47.9 mmol m(-2) d(-1)).
   Although significant (10.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1) on average), rho Diss were
   generally much lower than production rates. Uptake ratios (rho Si : rho
   C and rho Si : rho N) confirm that diatoms strongly dominate primary
   production in this area. At the bloom onset, decreasing
   dissolution-to-production ratios (D : P) indicate that the
   remineralization of silica could sustain most of the low silicon uptake
   and that the system progressively shifts toward a silica production
   regime which must be mainly supported by new source of silicic acid.
   Moreover, by comparing results from the two KEOPS expeditions (spring
   2011 and summer 2005), we suggest that there is a seasonal evolution of
   the processes decoupling Si and N cycles in the area. Indeed, the
   consumption of H4SiO4 standing stocks occurs only during the growing
   stage of the bloom when strong net silica production is observed,
   contributing to higher H4SiO4 depletion relative to NO3-. Then, the
   decoupling of H4SiO4 and NO3- is mainly controlled by the more efficient
   nitrogen recycling relative to Si. Gross Si : N uptake ratios were
   higher in the Fe-rich regions compared to the high-nutrient
   low-chlorophyll (HNLC) area, likely due to different diatom communities.
   This suggests that the diatom responses to natural Fe fertilization are
   more complex than previously thought, and that natural iron
   fertilization over long timescales does not necessarily decrease Si : N
   uptake ratios as suggested by the silicic acid leakage hypothesis.
   Finally, we propose the first seasonal estimate of the Si biogeochemical
   budget above the Kerguelen Plateau based on direct measurements. This
   study points out that naturally iron-fertilized areas of the Southern
   Ocean could sustain very high regimes of biogenic silica production,
   similar to those observed in highly productive upwelling systems.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater biodiversity has shown to be highly vulnerable to climate
   warming. Boreo-alpine species are especially at risk in the Alps because
   they have to migrate to higher elevations to avoid local extinction.
   Effects of climate warming could be partly counteracted by creating new
   freshwater habitats: this would boost the population sizes of the
   endangered species and would increase the connectivity between Alpine
   waterbodies to facilitate the species' upward dispersal and colonization
   of new habitats. Nevertheless, the localization of new habitats has to
   be carefully chosen, as successful restoration (or habitat creation)
   depends on many abiotic and ecological variables (e. g. habitats density
   and quality, connection between bodies of water, presence of targeted
   species, resistance of landscape to species movements). Furthermore,
   various socioeconomic drivers and actors determine the land and water
   uses in the Alps. Therefore we developed an innovative method for
   prioritization of areas for creation (or restoration) of small bodies of
   water, taking into account both ecological parameters (from species to
   landscape) and social ones. The method was developed in a test area (130
   km(2), in Canton Valais, Switzerland) representative of the Swiss Alpine
   landscapes and their associated socioeconomic activities.
   The proposed methodological framework consists of four steps which allow
   refining the geographical area to propose two or three small areas (some
   hectares) suitable for the creation of small water bodies. The first
   step investigates the regional scale, often several thousand km(2), with
   a focus on environmental considerations: presence of historical or
   contemporary wetlands and waterbodies, presence of cold stenotherm
   species, and favourable landscape (in terms of land use) and
   socioeconomic context. The second step identifies areas of biological
   connectivity between source ponds and future host ponds for cold
   stenotherm species, taking into account the distance between source and
   host ponds and landscape resistance to the movements of pro-pagules,
   finally highlighting the migration corridors. The third step checks the
   preselected areas with the aim of discarding catchments impaired by
   selective or diffuse pollutions. The fourth and final step is intended
   to enhance the probability of the project's social acceptance:
   qualitative interviews and field observations are conducted on a local
   scale (often one km2) and options are evaluated with local stakeholders.
   Conducting the four successive and complementary steps ensures that the
   selected areas have a high potential for hosting the alpine
   biodiversity, and furthermore provide a favourable social framework for
   success in the short as well as the long term. Such a tool should
   promote and facilitate actions for conserving freshwater biodiversity in
   the Alps.}},

Abstract = {{To take on the current and future challenges of global environmental
   change, fostering a widespread societal understanding of and engagement
   with the complex dynamics that characterize interacting human and
   natural systems is essential. Current science communication methods
   struggle with a number of specific challenges associated with
   communicating about complex systems. In this study we report on two
   collaborative processes, a short workshop and longer course, that aimed
   to harness the insights of interactive media designers and artists to
   overcome these challenges. The two processes resulted in 86 new
   interactive media concepts which were selected by the participants and
   organizers using set criteria and then evaluated using the same criteria
   by a panel of communication and media design experts and a panel of
   complex systems scientists using the same criteria. The top eight
   concepts are discussed in this paper. These concepts fell into the
   categories of serious games, group interaction concepts, and social
   media storytelling. The serious games focused directly on complex
   systems characteristics and were evaluated to be intuitive and engaging
   designs that combined transparency and complexity well. The group
   interaction concepts focused mostly on feedbacks and nonlinearity but
   were fully developed and tested in the workshops, and evaluated as
   engaging, accessible, and easy to implement in workshops and educational
   settings. The social media storytelling concepts involved less direct
   interactions with system dynamics but were seen as highly accessible to
   large scale audiences. The results of this study show the potential of
   interdisciplinary collaboration between complex systems scientists,
   designers, and artists. The results and process discussed in this paper
   show the value of more structural engagement of interactive media
   designers and artist communities in the development of communication
   tools about human and natural systems change.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{1-18}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Adaptive behaviours, particularly those related to resource
   harvest and the time available for fitness-enhancing activities, may
   serve as suitable surrogates for fitness.
   Methods: I explore this potential link between behaviour and
   eco-evolutionary dynamics with controlled field experiments. The
   experiments manipulated densities of meadow voles foraging in large
   replicated enclosures. I used the lock-step connection between resource
   harvest and fitness to generate three fitness surrogates: giving-up
   densities from artificial resource patches, quitting-harvest rates, and
   time available for non-foraging behaviours that enhance fitness.
   Results: Per capita consumption from food trays did not change with
   population size. Time allocated to foraging increased with population
   density. Quitting-harvest rates in both safe and risky patches declined
   linearly with population density. The total amount of time necessary for
   a new individual to acquire sufficient energy for maintenance increased
   hyperbolically. Invasion landscapes based on the three fitness
   surrogates yielded the same behaviourally and evolutionarily stable
   strategy (ESS) of habitat selection. But the fitness benefits,
   subsequent convergence towards the ESS, and potential variation about
   the ESS, varied.
   Conclusions: Adaptive foraging behaviour is a reliable and rapid metric
   for assessing the evolutionary stability of habitat selection. This
   proof of concept suggests that behavioural metrics may play a prominent
   role in assessments of other strategies. We may even be able to use
   behavioural metrics to forecast ecological and evolutionary futures

   phosphorus retention in a recent lake sediment: a novel analytical
   approach}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{5169-5180}},
Abstract = {{Vivianite, Fe-3 (PO4)(2)center dot 8H(2)O, is a ferrous iron phosphate
   mineral which forms in waterlogged soils and sediments. The phosphorus
   (P) bound in its crystal lattice is considered to be immobilised because
   vivianite is stable under anoxic, reducing, sedimentary conditions.
   Thus, vivianite formation can make a major contribution to P retention
   during early diagenesis. Much remains unknown about vivianite in
   sediments, because technical challenges have rendered direct
   identification and quantification difficult. To identify vivianite and
   assess its significance for P burial during early diagenesis we studied
   the consequences of a 1992/1993 in-lake application of FeCl3 and
   Fe(OH)(3) aimed at restoring Lake Gro beta-Glienicke (Berlin, Germany).
   In a novel approach, we firstly applied a heavy-liquid separation to the
   iron-rich surface sediments which allowed direct identification of
   vivianite by X-ray diffraction in the high-density (rho > 2.3 g cm(-3))
   sediment fraction. Secondly, we assessed the contribution of vivianite
   to P retention, combining results from chemical digestion with magnetic
   susceptibility data derived from magnetic hysteresis measurements.
   Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the dark blue spherical
   vivianite nodules were 40-180 mu m in diameter, and formed of platy- and
   needle-shaped crystal aggregates. Although equilibrium calculations
   indicated supersaturation of vivianite throughout the upper 30 cm of the
   sediment, the vivianite deposits were homogeneously distributed within,
   and restricted to, the upper 23 cm only. Thus, supersaturated pore water
   alone can-not serve as a reliable predictor for the in situ formation of
   vivianite. In Lake Gro beta-Glienicke, vivianite formation continues to
   be triggered by the artificial iron amendment more than 20 yr ago,
   significantly contributing to P retention in surface sediments.}},

Series = {{Ecological Research Monographs}},
Year = {{2014}},
Pages = {{327-337}},
Abstract = {{Local and global environmental changes produce shifts in species
   distribution as well as adaptive evolution in wild species. Recent
   advances in genomic analysis tools, such as the next-generation DNA
   sequencing technique, have allowed genetic observation of ecological and
   evolutionary responses to the environmental changes. In this review, we
   propose three approaches for `eco-evolutionary genomic observation' to
   assess and predict the effect of environmental changes on biodiversity.
   First, paleo-ecogenomics, the genomic and metagenomic analyses of
   ancient pollen grains or sediments, can be employed to identify longterm
   evolutionary changes, thereby facilitating the reconstruction of ancient
   biological communities and interactions. Second, chronological genomics,
   which uses museum or herbarium specimen samples to study population
   genomics, can be used to elucidate short-term evolutionary changes and
   detect the adaptive genes favored by natural or human-induced selection.
   Third, ecological genome niche modeling, based on the distribution data
   of adaptive variants detected by genome-wide scans and the geographic
   patterns of various environmental factors, will be useful for prediction
   of evolutionary responses to future environmental changes.
   These new approaches provide a point of view for observation of
   evolution caused by environmental changes in chronological order.}},

   in Barmah Forest, Murray River, Australia}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{149-162}},
Abstract = {{Context Frog species are now targets for delivery of high-value managed
   environmental flows on floodplains. Information on the drivers of frog
   presence and abundance is required to support adaptive management,
   including analysis of the roles of flood frequency, flood timing and
   habitat type.
   Aims This paper describes frog species richness and abundance responses
   to flooding and habitat type in the Barmah Forest, part of the largest
   river red gum forest in the world.
   Methods Surveys were conducted at 22 sites over 6 years, to determine
   species presence, relative abundance, and evidence of breeding. Data
   were then used to examine temporal patterns within and between wet and
   dry years and spatial relationships with site geomorphology, vegetation
   form and wetting frequency.
   Key results Six species were common and widespread, and three were rare.
   The seasonal timing of peak numbers of calling males differed among
   species. The seasonal pattern of calling for each species did not differ
   between wet and dry years; however, significantly lower numbers of frogs
   were recorded calling in dry years. The number of frogs calling was
   significantly higher in well vegetated grassy wetlands. Evidence of a
   positive relationship between wetting frequency and numbers of calling
   males was found for Limnodynastes fletcheri, Crinia signifera and
   Limnodynastes dumerilii. The abundance of tadpoles was significantly
   higher in wet years.
   Conclusions The seasonal timing of flooding in Barmah Forest will
   influence the breeding success of individual species with different
   preferences. Flooding from September to December is required to cover
   most preferred breeding seasons, but longer durations may be required to
   maximise recruitment. This, together with regular flooding of well
   vegetated grassy wetland habitat, will increase the likelihood of
   species persistence and maximise diversity. Insufficient flooding
   frequency will result in reduced frog species richness and abundance.
   Implications Managed flooding is important for frog abundance and
   species richness. This study emphasises the value of key habitats such
   as well vegetated grassy wetlands and reinforces the need to make their
   preservation a priority for management. It has identified knowledge gaps
   to drive future data collection for improved modelling, including a need
   for further research on flow-regime change and frog communities.}},

Abstract = {{Climate-driven changes in the fire regime within boreal forest
   ecosystems are likely to have important effects on carbon cycling and
   species composition. In the context of improving fire management options
   and developing more realistic scenarios of future change, it is
   important to understand how meteorology regulates different aspects of
   fire dynamics, including ignition, daily fire spread, and cumulative
   annual burned area. Here we combined Moderate-Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fires (MCD14ML), MODIS imagery
   (MOD13A1) and ancillary historic fire perimeter information to produce a
   data set of daily fire spread maps for Alaska during 2002-2011. This
   approach provided a spatial and temporally continuous representation of
   fire progression and a precise identification of ignition and extinction
   locations and dates for each wildfire. The fire-spread maps were
   analyzed with daily vapor pressure deficit (VPD) observations from the
   North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and lightning strikes from the
   Alaska Lightning Detection Network (ALDN). We found a significant
   relationship between daily VPD and likelihood that a lightning strike
   would develop into a fire ignition. In the first week after ignition,
   above average VPD increased the probability that fires would grow to
   large or very large sizes. Strong relationships also were identified
   between VPD and burned area at several levels of temporal and spatial
   aggregation. As a consequence of regional coherence in meteorology,
   ignition, daily fire spread, and fire extinction events were often
   synchronized across different fires in interior Alaska. At a regional
   scale, the sum of positive VPD anomalies during the fire season was
   positively correlated with annual burned area during the NARR era
   (1979-2011; R-2 = 0.45). Some of the largest fires we mapped had slow
   initial growth, indicating opportunities may exist for suppression
   efforts to adaptively manage these forests for climate change. The
   results of our spatiotemporal analysis provide new information about
   temporal and spatial dynamics of wildfires and have implications for
   modeling the terrestrial carbon cycle.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Environmentally induced farmer migration is an important livelihood
   strategy, yet little is known of the effects on the destination region
   agroecosystem information networks and management practices. In the
   forest-savanna transition zone (Brong Ahafo Region) of Ghana, where
   migration from northern regions (migrant) and from neighboring regions
   (settler) is active, we chart the role of migrant famers and the type of
   agroecosystem management practices embedded in information networks
   using a social networks approach. Based on empirical network data from
   44 respondents across three communities, we illustrate a diffuse
   information network, with variable tie frequency between settlement
   categories (local, settler, or migrant) of farmers. The cohesion of this
   network is dependent on a few strategic bridging ties initiated by
   migrant farmers, who are thus centrally positioned to exchange
   agroecosystem management practices between geographically and socially
   distant groups. At the individual level, migrant and settler farmers are
   more likely: (1) to have larger networks with more ties between members
   of their networks, (2) to be brokers positioned between non-migrant
   farmers, and (3) to tend (although not statistically significantly) to
   use pro-environmental management regimes, including agroforestry
   practices, new planting methods, and plot-scale weeding. We
   conceptualize this phenomenon as extended social and environmental
   experience and the deployment of social-ecological memory, with migrant
   farmers as potential agents of innovation and adaptive management.}},

Abstract = {{Developments in national fisheries and marine environmental policies
   during the last 30 years have changed the relationship between coastal
   communities and the marine resources that people in these communities
   traditionally harvested. In Norway, for example, when the state
   authorities have made decisions to defend what they regard as national
   interests, the local level has been left with authority over minor
   issues related to area planning in the coastal zone. Although coastal
   planning until recently was about sharing fishing areas between
   different users, we now see a spatial dimension emerging in planning,
   giving it a much broader scope. The processes of defining spatial
   properties and creating coastal space as a governable object have the
   potential to empower local communities. These processes contribute to
   enhanced local control and improved local participation in the
   governance of natural resources. In Norway, the 2008 Planning and
   Building Act strengthened the role of municipalities in local planning.
   In addition, the application of a new three-dimensional, spatial
   approach to coastal planning may create opportunities for new control
   over local resources. In marine spatial planning (MSP) the natural
   resources are seen as part of coastal spatial properties; thus,
   governing of sea space implies resource governance. As our examples
   illustrate, considerable power is associated with the ability to
   identify and define the properties of coastal space. MSP could become an
   important tool for controlling local resources, rebuilding collapsed
   fisheries, and managing them sustainably at the level of municipalities.}},

Title = {{Adapting adaptation: the English eco-town initiative as governance
   process}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Climate change adaptation and mitigation have become key policy drivers
   in the UK under its Climate Change Act of 2008. At the same time,
   urbanization has been high on the agenda, given the pressing need for
   substantial additional housing, particularly in southeast England. These
   twin policy objectives were brought together in the UK government's
   `eco-town' initiative for England launched in 2007, which has since
   resulted in four eco-town projects currently under development. We
   critically analyze the eco-town initiative's policy evolution and early
   planning phase from a multilevel governance perspective by focusing on
   the following two interrelated aspects: (1) the evolving governance
   structures and resulting dynamics arising from the development of the
   eco-town initiative at UK governmental level, and the subsequent partial
   devolution to local stakeholders, including local authorities and
   nongovernmental actors, under the new `localism' agenda; and (2) the
   effect of these governance dynamics on the conceptual and practical
   approach to adaptation through the emerging eco-town projects. As such,
   we problematize the impact of multilevel governance relations, and
   competing governance strategies and leadership, on shaping eco-town and
   related adaptation strategies and practice.}},

Title = {{Can current moisture responses predict soil CO2 efflux under altered
   precipitation regimes? A synthesis of manipulation experiments}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2991-3013}},
Abstract = {{As a key component of the carbon cycle, soil CO2 efflux (SCE) is being
   increasingly studied to improve our mechanistic understanding of this
   important carbon flux. Predicting ecosystem responses to climate change
   often depends on extrapolation of current relationships between
   ecosystem processes and their climatic drivers to conditions not yet
   experienced by the ecosystem. This raises the question of to what extent
   these relationships remain unaltered beyond the current climatic window
   for which observations are available to constrain the relationships.
   Here, we evaluate whether current responses of SCE to fluctuations in
   soil temperature and soil water content can be used to predict SCE under
   altered rainfall patterns. Of the 58 experiments for which we gathered
   SCE data, 20 were discarded because either too few data were available
   or inconsistencies precluded their incorporation in the analyses. The 38
   remaining experiments were used to test the hypothesis that a model
   parameterized with data from the control plots (using soil temperature
   and water content as predictor variables) could adequately predict SCE
   measured in the manipulated treatment. Only for 7 of these 38
   experiments was this hypothesis rejected. Importantly, these were the
   experiments with the most reliable data sets, i.e., those providing
   high-frequency measurements of SCE. Regression tree analysis
   demonstrated that our hypothesis could be rejected only for experiments
   with measurement intervals of less than 11 days, and was not rejected
   for any of the 24 experiments with larger measurement intervals. This
   highlights the importance of high-frequency measurements when studying
   effects of altered precipitation on SCE, probably because infrequent
   measurement schemes have insufficient capacity to detect shifts in the
   climate dependencies of SCE. Hence, the most justified answer to the
   question of whether current moisture responses of SCE can be
   extrapolated to predict SCE under altered precipitation regimes is `no'
   - as based on the most reliable data sets available. We strongly
   recommend that future experiments focus more strongly on establishing
   response functions across a broader range of precipitation regimes and
   soil moisture conditions. Such experiments should make accurate
   measurements of water availability, should conduct high-frequency SCE
   measurements, and should consider both instantaneous responses and the
   potential legacy effects of climate extremes. This is important, because
   with the novel approach presented here, we demonstrated that, at least
   for some ecosystems, current moisture responses could not be
   extrapolated to predict SCE under altered rainfall conditions.}},

   the post-Taupo succession on Mt Hauhungatahi, North Island, New Zealand}},
Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{26-U43}},
Abstract = {{Forest dynamics in New Zealand are shaped by catastrophic,
   landscape-level disturbances (e.g. volcanic eruptions, windstorms and
   fires). The long return-intervals of these disturbances, combined with
   the longevity of many of New Zealand's tree species, restrict empirical
   investigations of forest dynamics. In combination with empirical data
   (e.g. palaeoecological reconstructions), simulation modelling provides a
   way to address these limitations and to unravel complex ecological
   interactions. Here we adapt the forest landscape model LandClim to
   simulate dynamics across the large spatio-temporal scales relevant for
   New Zealand's forests. Using the western slope of Mt Hauhungatahi in the
   central North Island as a case study, we examine forest succession
   following the Taupo eruption (c. 1700 cal. years BP), and the subsequent
   emergence of elevational species zonation. Focusing on maximum growth
   rate and shade tolerance we used a pattern-oriented parameterisation
   approach to derive a set of life-history parameters that agree with
   those described in the ecological literature. With this parameter set,
   LandClim was able to reproduce similar spatio- temporal patterns in
   vegetation structure to those seen in pollen reconstructions and
   contemporary vegetation studies. The modelled successional sequence
   displayed a major shift in forest composition between simulation years
   400 to 700, when the dense initial stands of conifers (dominated mainly
   by Libocedrus bidwillii) were progressively replaced by the angiosperm
   Weinmannia racemosa in the montane forest. From around year 1000, the
   contemporary elevational species zonation was attained. Competition for
   light controlled the major successional trends and, together with
   temperature-limitation, explained the observed elevational species
   zonation. Although originally designed for European temperate forests,
   LandClim can simulate New Zealand landscape dynamics and forest response
   to catastrophic disturbances such as the Taupo eruption. We suggest that
   LandClim provides a suitable framework for investigating the role of
   spatial processes, in particular disturbance, in New Zealand's forest
   landscapes.}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-52}},
Abstract = {{Endemic biota of native grasslands commonly co-exist with introduced
   grazing mammals, and often this is seen as a conservation threat. The
   endangered pygmy bluetongue lizard (Tiliqua adelaidensis) is restricted
   to remnants of native grassland in the mid-north of South Australia,
   with a long history of sheep grazing. Pygmy bluetongue lizards use
   ambush predation from their burrow entrances, and prey capture may be
   more efficient in a habitat with low vegetation density. We
   experimentally investigated changes in predatory behaviour in this
   lizard, with different grass density. We maintained and filmed captive
   lizards, in sequence, in grassed and bare habitat, and in habitat with
   low and high grass density, and provided them with crickets
   (Teleogryllus commodus) as prey. In habitats with lower grass density
   lizards emerged from their burrows more, made more prey capture
   attempts, and these attempts were more often made with the body further
   emerged from the burrow. We suggest that some grazing by domestic stock
   might benefit predatory efficiency for this lizard, perhaps by allowing
   a clearer view of approaching prey when grass density is lower. Our
   results conform with a previous study of the behaviour of pygmy
   bluetongue lizards in their natural burrows in the field under different
   simulated grazing regimes. From a broader perspective, together the
   results suggest a balance between detrimental impacts and benefits from
   grazing pressures on grassland lizard species in other geographical
   regions, and the potential to maintain conservation good will among
   farming communities.}},

Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{53-63}},
Abstract = {{Age and structure of local vegetation (habitat complexity) are commonly
   assumed to be indicators of habitat quality for breeding birds, but for
   many species these relationships are poorly understood. The hihi
   (stitchbird Notiomystis cincta), an endangered New Zealand
   cavity-nesting passerine that only survives on mammalian predator-free
   islands or within fenced areas, has been the focus of intensive
   conservation management and research. Between 1992 and 2004 we examined
   the fledging success of 347 nests from four island populations. Habitat
   quality was improved at the two scrub/regenerating sites and one of the
   two mature/climax sites through management using supplementary feeding,
   nest-box parasite control or both. At two sites (one mature, one
   regenerating) management was stopped during the study allowing us to
   measure fledgling success with and without habitat quality improvement
   through management. At the population level, the number of chicks
   fledged per nest increased as management intensity increased and habitat
   quality increased. The positive effect of management was greatest for
   populations in lower quality habitats. To assess the relationship
   between fledging success and local habitat variables around the nesting
   site we used a height-frequency vegetation survey method sensitive to
   changes in vertical structural complexity at the two mature/climax
   sites. For 36 natural nests, a cross-validated regression-tree analysis
   (R-2 = 0.69) predicted that as habitat complexity increased, so did
   fledging success, which was generally higher for nests in trees with
   larger diameters (present in older forests). Because these habitats are
   free from nest predators, our results suggest that habitat age and
   complexity are proxies for habitat quality through effects on nestling
   food availability and/or nest-chamber characteristics. Our results
   support the current management approach of providing supplementary food
   to translocated hihi populations and suggest that supplementary food can
   be used to overcome resource deficiencies for this species in poorer
   quality habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Global warming is now unequivocal, and studies suggest it has started to

   temporally persistent shifts were identified in the 1960s, the 1980s and

   the first time an abrupt ecosystem shift between 1996 and 2003 in the
   North Sea, which had the same magnitude in terms of species response as
   the well-documented shift detected in the 1980s. All ecosystem shifts
   coincided with a significant change in hydro-climatic conditions and had
   consequences for the structure and the functioning of the ecosystems. We
   showed that the 3 shifts only impacted 40\% of the plankton species or

Abstract = {{In this paper we provide an overview of new knowledge on oxygen
   depletion (hypoxia) and related phenomena in aquatic systems resulting
   from the EU-FP7 project HYPOX ({''}In situ monitoring of oxygen
   depletion in hypoxic ecosystems of coastal and open seas, and landlocked
   water bodies{''}, www.hypox.net). In view of the anticipated oxygen loss
   in aquatic systems due to eutrophication and climate change, HYPOX was
   set up to improve capacities to monitor hypoxia as well as to understand
   its causes and consequences.
   Temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of hypoxia were analyzed in field
   studies in various aquatic environments, including the Baltic Sea, the
   Black Sea, Scottish and Scandinavian fjords, Ionian Sea lagoons and
   embayments, and Swiss lakes. Examples of episodic and rapid (hours)
   occurrences of hypoxia, as well as seasonal changes in bottom-water
   oxygenation in stratified systems, are discussed. Geologically driven
   hypoxia caused by gas seepage is demonstrated. Using novel technologies,
   temporal and spatial patterns of water-column oxygenation, from
   basin-scale seasonal patterns to meter-scale sub-micromolar oxygen
   distributions, were resolved. Existing multidecadal monitoring data were
   used to demonstrate the imprint of climate change and eutrophication on
   long-term oxygen distributions. Organic and inorganic proxies were used
   to extend investigations on past oxygen conditions to centennial and
   even longer timescales that cannot be resolved by monitoring. The
   effects of hypoxia on faunal communities and biogeochemical processes
   were also addressed in the project. An investigation of benthic fauna is
   presented as an example of hypoxia-devastated benthic communities that
   slowly recover upon a reduction in eutrophication in a system where
   naturally occurring hypoxia overlaps with anthropogenic hypoxia.
   Biogeochemical investigations reveal that oxygen intrusions have a
   strong effect on the microbially mediated redox cycling of elements.
   Observations and modeling studies of the sediments demonstrate the
   effect of seasonally changing oxygen conditions on benthic
   mineralization pathways and fluxes. Data quality and access are crucial
   in hypoxia research. Technical issues are therefore also addressed,
   including the availability of suitable sensor technology to resolve the
   gradual changes in bottom-water oxygen in marine systems that can be
   expected as a result of climate change. Using cabled observatories as
   examples, we show how the benefit of continuous oxygen monitoring can be
   maximized by adopting proper quality control. Finally, we discuss
   strategies for state-of-the-art data archiving and dissemination in
   compliance with global standards, and how ocean observations can
   contribute to global earth observation attempts.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Social-ecological resilience (SER) expresses the capacity of a
   social-ecological system to adapt and transform. We investigated the
   ways in which different types and transformations of social capital
   influence the SER of a region. The study area, the Asteroussia Mountains
   in southern Crete, Greece, is a typical semiarid hilly/mountainous area
   of the eastern Mediterranean in which land degradation is one of the
   most important issues in land management, mostly related to overgrazing
   because of the growing size of the flocks of sheep and goats. The
   approach followed was qualitative, with in-depth interviews with a small
   number of key stakeholders in the area. The findings indicate many
   important changes in the area in terms of its production, economy, and
   society, i.e., from a ``semiarid husbandry{''} period during the 1950s
   to the early 1980s, through a transition period lasting until the end of
   1980s, to a new state, the ``subsidized husbandry{''} period, abruptly
   terminated in 2008 by the ongoing economic crisis. These changes
   correspond to important changes in social capital and very low levels of
   wider social trust among stockbreeders, while trust toward other forms
   of collective action at the local/regional level is also limited.
   Agricultural subsidies in the 1980s and onward seemed to be an important
   ``vehicle{''} for this change. Another important factor is related to
   external inputs and cash availability. The most serious negative impact
   of all these changes seems to be the abandonment of long-term care for
   the land. Primary producers ceased to associate their income with land
   quality, and this appears to be one important reason, among others, for
   the intensification of grazing densities and the abandonment of
   practices that considered vegetation and soil quality.}},

Title = {{Ecosystem Services and Abrupt Transformations in a Coastal Wetland
   Social-Ecological System: Tubul-Raqui after the 2010 Earthquake in Chile}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Natural disasters can trigger sudden transformations and move ecosystems
   to different states where the provision of ecosystem services is
   altered. These changes in ecosystem services affect local communities'
   well-being and challenge users' adaptation capacities. We used the
   ecosystem services framework to understand the impacts of abrupt
   transformations, in a coastal wetland, associated to a similar to 1.6
   meter coseismic uplift after an 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Chile. Using
   mixed methods we (1) identified and prioritized ecosystem services from
   Tubul-Raqui wetland; (2) assessed conditions of services and human
   well-being before and after the earthquake; (3) investigated
   postcatastrophe human adaptations and responses; and (4) explored users'
   interests and visions about possible future social-ecological pathways.
   Results show spatially diversified effects of the uplift on ecosystem
   services, both negative and positive, representing threats and
   opportunities for different user groups around the wetland. The total
   loss of the cultivated seaweed ``pelillo{''} is associated with the most
   manifest reduction in perceptions of well-being among coastal users.
   Adaptive capacities triggered by pre-existing livelihood portfolios
   generated intensification in the exploitation of less impacted or
   enhanced ecosystem services which could be reducing resilience. Results
   show that two years after the transformation there is little attempt to
   create untried, new beginnings in the Tubul-Raqui wetland from which
   user groups could evolve to a more innovative livelihood and resource
   management system after the shift. Although visions about the future are
   not homogeneous among users, common interests regarding the conservation
   of key services are shared. The analysis of abrupt transformations
   through an ecosystem services approach provides a powerful framework for
   the study of environmental change and associated impacts on local
   communities.}},

   Change: Trade-Offs in Service Provisioning and Adaptability}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{The issue of rapid change in environmental conditions under which
   ecosystem processes and human interventions will take place in the
   future is relatively new to forestry, whereas the provision of ecosystem
   services, e. g., timber or fresh water, is at the very heart of the
   original concept of forest management. Forest managers have developed
   ambitious deterministic approaches to provide the services demanded, and
   thus the use of deterministic approaches for adapting to climate change
   seem to be a logical continuation. However, as uncertainty about the
   intensity of climate change is high, forest managers need to answer this
   uncertainty conceptually. One may envision an indeterministic approach
   to cope with this uncertainty; but how the services will be provided in
   such a concept remains unclear. This article aims to explore the
   fundamental aspects of both deterministic and indeterministic approaches
   used in forestry to cope with climate change, and thereby point out
   trade-offs in service provisioning and adaptability. A forest owner
   needs to be able to anticipate these trade-offs in order to make
   decisions towards sustainable forest management under climate change.}},

Abstract = {{At the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio in June 2012,
   world leaders committed to the conservation and sustainable use of
   marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (the
   high seas). Our analysis of gaps in high seas management indicates that
   a paradigm shift to a more systematic approach will be needed to
   safeguard high seas biodiversity from mounting threats. Experience from
   terrestrial and coastal areas indicates that a systematic approach to
   conservation planning and management can help to maintain ecosystem
   health and productivity while enabling sustainable use. Our analysis
   further demonstrates that the current legal regime on the high seas is
   insufficient to realize these objectives: management institutions have
   neither an adequate mandate for integrated planning nor the ability to
   effectively coordinate across multiple management regimes. We identify
   key elements for future high seas management and posit that a
   two-pronged approach is most promising: the development of an improved
   global legal regime that incorporates systematic planning as well as the
   expansion of existing and new regional agreements and mandates. This

Abstract = {{Chemical signaling mediates nearly all aspects of species interactions.
   Our knowledge of these signals has progressed dramatically, and now
   includes good characterizations of the bioactivities, modes of action,
   biosynthesis, and genetic programming of numerous compounds affecting a
   wide range of species. A major challenge now is to integrate this
   information so as to better understand actual selective pressures under
   natural conditions, make meaningful predictions about how organisms and
   ecosystems will respond to a changing environment, and provide useful
   guidance to managers who must contend with difficult trade-offs among
   competing socioeconomic values. One approach is to place stronger
   emphasis on cross-scale interactions, an understanding of which can help
   us better connect pattern with process, and improve our ability to make
   mechanistically grounded predictions over large areas and time frames.
   The opportunity to achieve such progress has been heightened by the
   rapid development of new scientific and technological tools. There are
   significant difficulties, however: Attempts to extend arrays of
   lower-scale processes into higher scale functioning can generate overly
   diffuse patterns. Conversely, attempts to infer process from pattern can
   miss critically important lower-scale drivers in systems where their
   biological and statistical significance is negated after critical
   thresholds are breached. Chemical signaling in bark beetle - conifer
   interactions has been explored for several decades, including by the two
   pioneers after whom this award is named. The strong knowledge base
   developed by many researchers, the importance of bark beetles in
   ecosystem functioning, and the socioeconomic challenges they pose,
   establish these insects as an ideal model for studying chemical
   signaling within a cross-scale context. This report describes our recent
   work at three levels of scale: interactions of bacteria with host plant
   compounds and symbiotic fungi (tree level, biochemical time),
   relationships among inducible and constitutive defenses, population
   dynamics, and plastic host-selection behavior (stand level, ecological
   time), and climate-driven range expansion of a native eruptive species
   into semi-na < ve and potentially na < ve habitats (geographical level,
   evolutionary time). I approach this problem by focusing primarily on one
   chemical group, terpenes, by emphasizing the curvilinear and
   threshold-structured basis of most underlying relationships, and by
   focusing on the system's feedback structure, which can either buffer or
   amplify relationships across scales.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to introduce the robust optimum (RO) method as an

   ranges of a taxon with respect to an environmental variable in

   scale estimates rather than on the mean and the standard deviation used

   that the presence of outliers and the asymmetry of the distribution of
   the environmental variable might cause a significant effect on the
   WA-calculated ecological optimum as well as on tolerance ranges. We
   compared both methods through the identification of potential biological
   indicators of global warming. Biological data included several benthic,
   oligostenotherm macroinvertebrate families inhabiting the JA(0)car River
   Basin (JRB, eastern Spain). The results of this comparison suggest that
   the RO method is more appropriate for estimating the distribution of
   taxa and, consequently, that it provides more realistic information for

Abstract = {{Single-species life history parameters are central to ecological
   research and management, including the fields of macro-ecology,
   fisheries science, and ecosystem modeling. However, there has been
   little independent evaluation of the precision and accuracy of the life
   history values in global and publicly available databases. We therefore
   develop a novel method based on a Bayesian errors-in-variables model
   that compares database entries with estimates from local experts, and we
   illustrate this process by assessing the accuracy and precision of
   entries in FishBase, one of the largest and oldest life history
   databases. This model distinguishes biases among seven life history
   parameters, two types of information available in FishBase (i.e.,
   published values and those estimated from other parameters), and two
   taxa (i.e., bony and cartilaginous fishes) relative to values from
   regional experts in the United States, while accounting for additional
   variance caused by sex- and region-specific life history traits. For
   published values in FishBase, the model identifies a small positive bias
   in natural mortality and negative bias in maximum age, perhaps caused by
   unacknowledged mortality caused by fishing. For life history values
   calculated by FishBase, the model identified large and inconsistent
   biases. The model also demonstrates greatest precision for body size
   parameters, decreased precision for values derived from geographically
   distant populations, and greatest between-sex differences in age at
   maturity. We recommend that our bias and precision estimates be used in
   future errors-in-variables models as a prior on measurement errors. This
   approach is broadly applicable to global databases of life history
   traits and, if used, will encourage further development and improvements
   in these databases.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of species in ecosystems are rare, but the ecosystem
   consequences of losing rare species are poorly known. To understand how
   rare species may influence ecosystem functioning, this study quantifies
   the contribution of species based on their relative level of rarity to
   community functional diversity using a trait-based approach. Given that
   rarity can be defined in several different ways, we use four different
   definitions of rarity: abundance (mean and maximum), geographic range,
   and habitat specificity. We find that rarer species contribute to
   functional diversity when rarity is defined by maximum abundance,
   geographic range, and habitat specificity. However, rarer species are
   functionally redundant when rarity is defined by mean abundance.
   Furthermore, when using abundance-weighted analyses, we find that rare
   species typically contribute significantly less to functional diversity
   than common species due to their low abundances. These results suggest
   that rare species have the potential to play an important role in
   ecosystem functioning, either by offering novel contributions to
   functional diversity or via functional redundancy depending on how rare
   species are defined. Yet, these contributions are likely to be greatest
   if the abundance of rare species increases due to environmental change.
   We argue that given the paucity of data on rare species, understanding
   the contribution of rare species to community functional diversity is an
   important first step to understanding the potential role of rare species
   in ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity hotspots understandably attract considerable conservation
   attention. However, deserts are rarely viewed as conservation priority
   areas, due to their relatively low productivity, yet these systems are
   home to unique species, adapted to harsh and highly variable
   environments. While global attention has been focused on hotspots, the
   world's largest tropical desert, the Sahara, has suffered a catastrophic
   decline in megafauna. Of 14 large vertebrates that have historically
   occurred in the region, four are now extinct in the wild, including the
   iconic scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah). The majority has disappeared
   from more than 90\% of their Saharan range, including addax (Addax
   nasomaculatus), dama gazelle (Nanger dama) and Saharan cheetah (Acinonyx
   jubatus hecki) - all now on the brink of extinction. Greater
   conservation support and scientific attention for the region might have
   helped to avert these catastrophic declines. The Sahara serves as an
   example of a wider historical neglect of deserts and the human
   communities who depend on them. The scientific community can make an
   important contribution to conservation in deserts by establishing
   baseline information on biodiversity and developing new approaches to
   sustainable management of desert species and ecosystems. Such approaches
   must accommodate mobility of both people and wildlife so that they can
   use resources most efficiently in the face of low and unpredictable
   rainfall. This is needed to enable governments to deliver on their
   commitments to halt further degradation of deserts and to improve their
   status for both biodiversity conservation and human well-being. Only by
   so-doing will deserts be able to support resilient ecosystems and

   we aim to determine the factors underlying the extraordinary radiation
   of the subfamily Bromelioideae, one of the most diverse clades among the
   neotropical plant family Bromeliaceae. Based on an extended molecular
   phylogenetic data set, we examine the effect of two putative key
   innovations, that is, the Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) and the
   water-impounding tank, on speciation and extinction rates. To this aim,
   we develop a novel Bayesian implementation of the phylogenetic
   comparative method, binary state speciation and extinction, which
   enables hypotheses testing by Bayes factors and accommodates the
   uncertainty on model selection by Bayesian model averaging. Both CAM and
   tank habit were found to correlate with increased net diversification,
   thus fulfilling the criteria for key innovations. Our analyses further
   revealed that CAM photosynthesis is correlated with a twofold increase
   in speciation rate, whereas the evolution of the tank had primarily an
   effect on extinction rates that were found five times lower in
   tank-forming lineages compared to tank-less clades. These differences

Abstract = {{Proposed European policy in the agricultural sector will place higher
   emphasis on soil organic carbon (SOC), both as an indicator of soil
   quality and as a means to offset CO2 emissions through soil carbon (C)
   sequestration. Despite detailed national SOC data sets in several
   European Union (EU) Member States, a consistent C stock estimation at EU
   scale remains problematic. Data are often not directly comparable,
   different methods have been used to obtain values (e.g. sampling,
   laboratory analysis) and access may be restricted. Therefore, any
   evolution of EU policies on C accounting and sequestration may be
   constrained by a lack of an accurate SOC estimation and the availability
   of tools to carry out scenario analysis, especially for agricultural
   soils. In this context, a comprehensive model platform was established
   at a pan-European scale (EU+Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia,
   Montenegro, Albania, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Norway)
   using the agro-ecosystem SOC model CENTURY. Almost 164000 combinations
   of soil-climate-land use were computed, including the main arable crops,
   orchards and pasture. The model was implemented with the main management
   practices (e.g. irrigation, mineral and organic fertilization, tillage)
   derived from official statistics. The model results were tested against
   inventories from the European Environment and Observation Network
   (EIONET) and approximately 20000 soil samples from the 2009 LUCAS
   survey, a monitoring project aiming at producing the first coherent,
   comprehensive and harmonized top-soil data set of the EU based on
   harmonized sampling and analytical methods. The CENTURY model estimation
   of the current 0-30cm SOC stock of agricultural soils was 17.63Gt; the
   model uncertainty estimation was below 36\% in half of the NUTS2 regions
   considered. The model predicted an overall increase of this pool
   according to different climate-emission scenarios up to 2100, with C
   loss in the south and east of the area (involving 30\% of the whole

   higher C input as a consequence of increased CO2 atmospheric
   concentration and favourable crop growing conditions, especially in

   policies, this platform of simulation appears to be a very promising
   tool to orient future policymaking decisions.}},

Title = {{Modeling and prediction of natural gas fracking pad landscapes in the

Abstract = {{Natural gas fracking pad sites, as a type of industrial landscape, have
   been blooming up in Marcellus Shale region especially within the State
   of Pennsylvania in the last few years. However, no study has explored
   the driving landscape and environmental variables of fracking pad sites,
   and how gas fracking pads as a specific landscape spread out in the
   Marcellus Shale region. Using the Washington County, Pennsylvania, USA
   as the study area, this paper proposes a novel GIS landscape modeling
   approach to model the relationships between landscape variables and
   natural gas fracking pad sites. The impacts of significant landscape
   variables on natural gas fracking pad sites are assessed. Statistic
   diagnostics of spatial logistic regression modeling find significant
   landscape variables of elevation, slope, and land use land cover. Higher
   elevation will result in higher probability to be fracking pad sites,
   while deeper slopes will result in a lower probability to be fracking
   pad sites. Natural gas fracking pad sites do not randomly intrude the
   initial landscapes, while land use land cover experiences different
   invasive risks of natural gas fracking, and in the order of open water,
   developed land, barren land, forest land, shrub land, grassland,
   agriculture land, and wetland, the probability of being intruded by
   natural gas fracking sites increases at 3.76\%. This landscape model
   finally is used to predict natural gas fracking pad sites. The predicted
   spatial distribution provides significant insight for landscape and
   natural resources regulation, land use administration, transportation
   and urban planning, and ecosystem and environment conservations. (C)

Abstract = {{Dynamic global vegetation models need to be improved to accurately
   represent fire and land-use change in Amazonia. To this end, we are
   working on improving existent dynamic vegetation models to account for
   such strong disturbances, and aim to perform new analyses to quantify
   how fire, deforestation and climate change may combine to affect the
   distribution of major biomes and climate in the region. At present, we
   concentrate the development and implementation of new fire models on the
   simulation of fire probability and effects on vegetation dynamics, based
   on methods already tested in global dynamic vegetation models where fire
   potential is driven by the combination of presence of fuel,
   flammability, and sources of ignitions. To account for fire disturbance
   we assumed that the fraction of the vegetation affect by fires is
   proportional to the fire probability. Deforestation is directly
   interpreted as a fraction of the affected vegetation, and it is assumed
   to disturb tropical, temperate and conifer broadleaf, evergreen and
   deciduous trees. Both disturbances affect biomass, leaf area index, and
   total ecosystem aboveground net primary productivity, modifying the
   fractional cover of forest and herbaceous canopies. These

Booktitle = {{ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH}},

Pages = {{1911-1919}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: As well-known, aerial firefighting is an effective
   solution suppressing forest fire, however there is no doubt, this tool
   in many cases can be the only one effective solution, even if it is very
   expensive. Following the above idea, any new method that is able to
   reduce the cost of aerial means supporting forest fire management, is
   worth examining as a new aerial solution. Methods: This article used
   practical experiments of the aerial firefighting, created a graphics
   model to understand the logistic problem, made assumptions to
   concentrate on the key problems and with mathematical backgrounds some
   logistic functions meaning distance and capacity axes. Results and
   discussion: The effectiveness of air tankers depends on the distance
   between the fire zone and water resource. The shorter the distance is
   between them, the higher the effectiveness is using aerials. This
   relation can be shown even at a function; however the change is not
   linear. The rate of the curve depends on the distance, larger distance
   means smaller change and vice versa, shorter distance means bigger scale
   of change. This result gives the tipping point where the higher costs of
   suggested solution - aerial water supply system will be balanced by the
   higher amount of bombed water.}},

Abstract = {{Current rates of biodiversity decline are unprecedented and largely

Abstract = {{The genetic material (DNA fragments of cellular or extracellular origin)

   such as water, soil, or sediments is defined as environmental DNA

   method for aquatic invasive species early detection and surveillance. We
   developed molecular markers for eDNA detection of the African jewelfish
   (Hemichromis letourneuxi) in and around Loxahatchee National Wildlife
   Refuge, Florida. The lower limit of detection using these markers was
   determined as well as the effect of fish density and time on detection
   using controlled experiments. Specificity and sensitivity of these
   markers was tested in aquarium trials and also in field samples. Results
   showed that developed markers (probe and primers) for Taqman assays were
   sensitive and specific for eDNA detection via traditional and
   quantitative PCR methods (qPCR). The observed theoretical minimal qPCR
   detection level, based on standard curve analysis for this species, was
   approximately 0.0002 ng/uL (R-2 = 0.90) at a PCR cycling threshold (C-T)
   of 28.5-29. There was a positive and significant relationship between
   fish density and eDNA detection with detection probabilities ranging
   from 0.32-1.00 depending on fish density. A negative and significant
   relationship between average C-T values and density further corroborated
   our findings that target eDNA increased with increasing fish density.
   Developed markers detected the presence of H. letourneuxi in the canal
   adjacent to but not in Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. The single
   positive found in the canal adjacent to Loxahatchee National Wildlife
   Refuge showed a similar C-T value to the observed average for density of

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Aim We develop the first global model of connectivity for a generic
   broadcast spawning coral, and compare the results to connectivity
   estimates from genetic studies, general biogeographic patterns and
   theories. We also derive various connectivity indices' describing
   relative isolation and source potential between locations.
   LocationModelled oceans 47 degrees S-47 degrees N.
   Methods Dispersal of model coral larvae' was simulated over 8 years
   using an individual-based biophysical dispersal model driven by 1/12
   degrees-resolution surface ocean current data and incorporating
   individual trait variability (e.g. a phased pre-competency period).
   Source and arrival locations of modelled larvae on suitable reef habitat
   gave standardized dispersal paths and relative levels of connectivity.
   ResultsIn the model c. 50\% of connections occurred within 50-100km,
   with rarer dispersal between regions linking entire oceans in a stepping
   stone' fashion. The central Pacific was an almost complete barrier to
   dispersal, only rarely breached westward from the Galapagos to Marquesas
   Islands. Areas showing strong isolation also included Hawaii, Easter
   Island, the Red Sea and the eastern Atlantic. The Indo-West Pacific and
   Great Barrier Reef showed the highest levels of connectivity, with
   secondary peaks in the western Indian Ocean, corresponding to areas of
   enriched coral diversity. The central Indo-Pacific diversity hotspot was
   overall a greater source than sink for dispersal.
   ConclusionsThis study provides a global view of connectivity that
   complements genetic and biogeographic work as well as providing a number
   of novel findings relevant to biogeographic theories (e.g. the central
   Indo-Pacific as a dispersal source; Johnston Atoll as the sole
   stepping-stone' into Hawaii). Discrepancies with proposed connectivity
   patterns (e.g. one-way, westward, connectivity across the central
   Pacific) present hypotheses for future research. The model represents an
   effective tool for exploring the factors controlling connectivity on
   this scale and the effects of climate change on future connectivity, and
   will also aid predictions of future reef distributions.}},

   Effective conservation or wishful thinking?}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {{57-65}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Increasingly, conservation professionals and regulatory agencies are
   attempting to identify ecological thresholds that define a point at
   which populations or communities demonstrate a marked response to human
   disturbance. Such thresholds may serve as the foundation for recognizing
   and then imposing limits on the levels of disturbance or types of land
   use. Although an intuitive concept, I argue that there are numerous
   scientific and practical limitations to applying ecological thresholds
   to conservation decision making. First, the concept is limited by the
   lack of a clear and universally accepted definition. Often, a threshold
   is defined as the point at which a population demonstrates a nonlinear
   ecological or biological response to some critical level of disturbance.
   Alternative definitions are premised on different trajectories of
   response or a direct recognition of conservation risks when prioritising
   socioeconomic values. Second, there is no clear or consistent method for
   identifying ecological thresholds including the appropriate response
   variables. Third, there is little evidence to suggest that ecological
   thresholds generalize to other species or populations: this limits the
   efficiency of thresholds as a decision making tool. Fourth, even where
   ecological thresholds are identified for the purpose of regulation or
   conservation planning, there are few examples of effective
   implementation. In comparison, regulatory limits are premised on the
   ecological response of populations to disturbance, but also consider the
   socioeconomic realities of conservation decision making including the
   risk associated with greater levels of development. Limits can be
   identified through participatory decision making processes that allow a
   consideration of potential future conditions within the context of
   current ecological and economic circumstances. When followed with
   long-term monitoring, regulatory limits can improve existing or provide
   new avenues for conservation planning and regulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{An Integrated Strategy for Grassland Easement Acquisition in the Prairie

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{267-279}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Acquisition of perpetual grassland easements is a principal tactic used
   by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and its partners
   to protect nesting habitat for migratory birds in the Prairie Pothole
   Region of North and South Dakota, USA. This public-private partnership
   resulted in the conservation of >344,000 ha of grassland during
   1998-2012. Past easement acquisition has been targeted to landscapes
   with greatest expected accessibility to breeding duck pairs without
   active consideration of probability of conversion or cost of protection.
   The rising cost of easement acquisition in recent years indicates that
   re-evaluation and refinement of the easement acquisition strategy could
   help to improve programmatic outcomes. We assessed regional patterns of
   easement acquisition during 1998-2012, evaluated the current targeting
   strategy, and used a combination of publicly available and proprietary
   geospatial data to develop an easement-targeting Geographic Information
   System that integrated information about conversion probability and
   protection cost with current targeting criteria. Our assessment
   indicated that grassland protection was negatively affected by rising
   land prices during 1998-2012. In the 5 y between 2008 and 2012, about
   100,000 ha of grassland were protected at a cost of \$83 million (U. S.
   dollars). The 2008-2012 acquisitions represented 30\% of total
   protection during 1998-2012 but composed 47\% of the total expenditure.
   We observed strong evidence that easements were targeted to priority
   landscapes both before and after formalization of the USFWS conservation
   strategy in 2004. We also found evidence of an opportunity to increase
   efficiency of future acquisitions. We identified 0.9 million ha of
   currently unprotected priority grassland in the region with greater than
   expected conversion risk and smaller than expected protection cost. We
   suggest that future grassland easement acquisition be refocused on this
   refined priority area and that an adaptive approach to future easement
   acquisition (including targeted acquisitions, directed monitoring, and
   data-based decisions) provides a logical framework for implementation of
   this new strategy and will facilitate continued conservation success.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{AimSpecies distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to forecast
   climate change impacts. These models, however, are subject to important
   assumptions and limitations. By integrating two independent but
   complementary methods, ensemble SDMs and statistical phylogeography, we
   addressed key assumptions and created robust assessments of climate
   change impacts on species distributions while improving the conservation
   value of these projections.
   LocationNorth American cordillera.
   MethodsThis approach was demonstrated using the arctic-alpine plant
   Rhodiola integrifolia (Crassulaceae). SDMs were fitted to current and
   past climates using eight models, two thresholds and one to three
   climate data sets. These projections were combined to create a map of
   stable climate (refugia) since the Last Interglacial (124,000kya). Five
   biogeographic hypotheses were developed based on the configuration of
   refugia and tested using statistical phylogeography. Projection of SDMs
   into the future was contingent on agreement across approaches; future
   projections (to 2085) used five climate data sets and two greenhouse gas
   scenarios.
   ResultsA multiple-refugia hypothesis was supported by both methods,
   confirming the assumption of niche conservatism in R.integrifolia and
   justifying the projection of SDMs onto future climates. Future
   projections showed substantial loss of climatically suitable habitat.
   Southern populations had the greatest losses, although the biogeographic
   scale of modelling may overpredict extinction risks in areas of
   topographic complexity. Past and future SDMs were assessed for novel
   values of climate variables; areas of novel climate were flagged as
   having higher uncertainty.
   Main conclusionsIntegrating molecular approaches with spatial analyses
   of species distributions under global change has great potential to
   improve conservation decision-making. Molecular tools can support and
   improve current methods for understanding the vulnerability of species
   to climate change and provide additional data upon which to base
   conservation decisions, such as prioritizing the conservation of areas
   of high genetic diversity to build evolutionary resiliency within
   populations.}},

Journal = {{THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{91-103}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The variance effective population size (N-ev) is a key concept in
   population biology, because it quantifies the microevolutionary process
   of random genetic drift, and understanding the characteristics of N-ev
   is thus of central importance. Current formulas for Nev for populations
   with overlapping generations weight age classes according to their
   reproductive values (i.e. reflecting the contribution of genes from
   separate age classes to the population growth) to obtain a correct
   measure of genetic drift when computing the variance of the allele
   frequency change over time. In this paper, we examine the effect of
   applying different weights to the age classes using a novel analytical
   approach for exploring N-ev. We consider a haploid organism with
   overlapping generations and populations of increasing, declining, or
   constant expected size and stochastic variation with respect to the
   number of individuals in the separate age classes. We define Nov, as a
   function of how the age classes are weighted, and of the span between
   the two points in time, when measuring allele frequency change. With
   this model, time profiles for N-ev can be calculated for populations
   with various life histories and with fluctuations in life history
   composition, using different weighting schemes. We examine analytically
   and by simulations when Nei, using a weighting scheme with respect to
   reproductive contribution of separate age classes, accurately reflect
   the variance of the allele frequency change due to genetic drift over
   time. We show that the discrepancy of N-ev, calculated with reproductive
   values as weights, compared to when individuals are weighted equally,
   tends to a constant when the time span between the two measurements
   increases. This constant is zero only for a population with a constant
   expected population size. Our results confirm that the effect of
   ignoring overlapping generations, when empirically assessing Nell from
   allele frequency shifts, gets smaller as the time interval between
   samples increases. Our model has empirical applications including
   assessment of (i) time intervals necessary to permit ignoring the effect
   of overlapping generations for N-ev estimation by means of the temporal
   method, and (ii) effects of life table manipulation on N-ev over varying
   time periods. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is expected to be a top driver of global biodiversity
   loss in the 21st century. It poses new challenges to conserving and
   managing imperiled species, particularly in marine and estuarine
   ecosystems. The use of climate-related science in statutorily driven
   species management, such as under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA),
   is in its early stages. This article provides an overview of ESA
   processes, with emphasis on the mandate to the National Marine Fisheries
   Service (NMFS) to manage listed marine, estuarine, and anadromous
   species. Although the ESA is specific to the United States, its
   requirements are broadly relevant to conservation planning. Under the
   ESA, species, subspecies, and distinct population segments may be listed
   as either endangered or threatened, and taking of most listed species
   (harassing, harming, pursuing, wounding, killing, or capturing) is
   prohibited unless specifically authorized via a case-by-case permit
   process. Government agencies, in addition to avoiding take, must ensure
   that actions they fund, authorize, or conduct are not likely to
   jeopardize a listed species' continued existence or adversely affect
   designated critical habitat. Decisions for which climate change is
   likely to be a key factor include: determining whether a species should
   be listed under the ESA, designating critical habitat areas, developing
   species recovery plans, and predicting whether effects of proposed human
   activities will be compatible with ESA-listed species' survival and
   recovery. Scientific analyses that underlie these critical conservation
   decisions include risk assessment, long-term recovery planning, defining

   Climatico, los Ecosistemas Marinos y el Acta Estadunidense de Especies
   en Peligro
   Resumen Se espera que el cambio climatico sea un principal conductor de
   la perdida de biodiversidad global en el siglo 21. Esto proporciona
   nuevos retos para la conservacion y el manejo de especies en peligro,
   particularmente en ecosistemas marinos y estuarinos. El uso de ciencias
   relacionadas con el cambio climatico en el manejo de especies
   estatutarios, como bajo el Acta Estadunidense de Especies en Peligro
   (ESA), se encuentra en sus fases iniciales. Este articulo proporciona un
   analisis de los procesos de ESA, con enfasis en los mandatos al Servicio
   Nacional de Pesqueras Marinas (NMFS) para enlistar especies marinas,
   estuarinas y anadromas. Aunque la ESA es especifica de los Estados
   Unidos, sus requerimientos en general son relevantes para la
   planificacion de la conservacion. Bajo la ESA, las especies, subespecies
   y segmentos distintivos de la poblacion pueden enlistarse como en
   peligro o amenazadas, y la colecta de la mayoria de los especies
   enlistadas (molestar, danar, perseguir, herir, matar o capturar) esta
   prohibida a menos que sea autorizada especificamente por un proceso de
   permiso caso-por-caso. Las agencias gubernamentales, ademas de evitar la
   colecta, deben asegurar que las acciones que patrocinan, autorizan o
   llevan a cabo no pongan en peligro la existencia continua de una especie
   enlistada ni afecten negativamente habitat criticos designados. Las
   decisiones para las cuales el cambio climatico probablemente sea
   considerado un factor clave incluyen: determinar si una especie deberia
   estar enlistada bajo la ESA, designar areas de habitat critico,
   desarrollar planes de recuperacion de especies, y predecir si los
   efectos de actividades humanas propuestas pueden ser compatibles con la
   supervivencia y recuperacion de especies enlistadas en ESA. Los analisis
   cientificos que subyacen estas decisiones criticas para la conservacion
   incluyen estudios de riesgo, planeacion de recuperacion a largo plazo,
   definir las bases ambientales y definir escalas temporales y espaciales
   apropiadas. Aunque la orientacion especifica todavia esta evolucionando,
   esta claro que los cambios sin precedentes en los ecosistemas globales
   causados por el cambio climatico necesitan informacion nueva y nuevas
   aproximaciones para la conservacion de especies en peligro.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria comprise the most diverse domain of life on Earth, where they
   occupy nearly every possible ecological niche and play key roles in
   biological and chemical processes. Studying the composition and ecology
   of bacterial ecosystems and understanding their function are of prime
   importance. High-throughput sequencing technologies enable nearly
   comprehensive descriptions of bacterial diversity through 16S ribosomal
   RNA gene amplicons. Analyses of these communities generally rely upon
   taxonomic assignments through reference data bases or clustering
   approaches using de facto sequence similarity thresholds to identify
   operational taxonomic units. However, these methods often fail to
   resolve ecologically meaningful differences between closely related
   organisms in complex microbial data sets. In this paper, we describe
   oligotyping, a novel supervised computational method that allows
   researchers to investigate the diversity of closely related but distinct
   bacterial organisms in final operational taxonomic units identified in
   environmental data sets through 16S ribosomal RNA gene data by the
   canonical approaches. Our analysis of two data sets from two different
   environments demonstrates the capacity of oligotyping at discriminating
   distinct microbial populations of ecological importance. Oligotyping can
   resolve the distribution of closely related organisms across
   environments and unveil previously overlooked ecological patterns for
   microbial communities. The URL http://oligotyping.org offers an
   open-source software pipeline for oligotyping.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{813-823}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Terrestrial laserscanning (TLS), also called ground-based LiDAR (Light
   Detection And Ranging) is a relatively new method which revolutionised
   geomorphological research in many domains. However, detailed studies of
   tidal flats by TLS have not been described in the literature yet. This
   study aims to fill this methodological gap by the application of TLS at
   two different locations on the coast of Jiangsu Province, Eastern China,
   and an assessment of the usability of this method for geomorphological
   research in such environments. The acquired point clouds are first
   processed to remove erroneous and noisy points. Subsequently, point
   clouds are computed to produce polygonal meshes and grid-based digital
   terrain model (DTM) more commonly used by the scientific community. The
   accuracy of the measurements is assessed by an analysis of elevation
   deviations for flat and horizontal concrete blocks. High quality point
   clouds with point densities of up to 4,000 points/m(2) were acquired for
   a distance of up to 200 m. The data allowed for the detection of small
   landforms such as tidal channels, creeks and ripples in centimetre and
   decimetre scale. The point clouds had an average error of approximately
   3 mm, however for some few points errors of up to 1.8 cm were detected.
   Based on the results it can be concluded that TLS can be a useful
   additional method for geomorphological research on tidal flats due to
   its ability to describe the landforms from high density point clouds.
   Repeated scanning could therefore provide data to quantitatively and
   qualitatively describe geomorphological changes over wider areas and
   thereby improve the understanding of sedimentation and erosion on tidal
   flats.}},

Abstract = {{The rural spaces in Europe are undergoing complex processes of
   transition, at multiple scales, and rhythms. In order to grasp and
   understand the changes occurring, the need emerges for new, conceptual
   approaches that make it possible to combine the different factors that
   shape spaces. Recent, literature on the multifunctional character of
   rural spaces and their transition pathways shows the, need for spatially
   based approaches, where the natural characteristics of a landscape are
   combined, with the socio-economic and cultural drivers that affect its
   changes. Experience shows how practical, questions on the changes
   affecting the rural, addressed by society to the scientific community,
   are of a, new character and require novel research approaches. This
   paper argues that landscape based, approaches can be useful basis for
   the required conceptual innovation. The paper presents and, discusses a
   set of examples of practice driven research developments, in contrasting
   regions of Europe. And it proposes a conceptual model which aims to
   contextualize empirical research driven by, problems set up in practice,
   and combining the ecological and structural dimensions with the
   socioeconomic, and cultural ones, all converging in the rural landscape,
   at multiple scales. The landscape, as, the spatial entity, in its
   material and immaterial dimensions, is presented in this paper as the
   most, comprehensive basis for the required step forward. This does not
   mean a disciplinary landscape, analysis revisited, but a new multi-scale
   and multi-domain place based approach, where the place is, the rural

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2544-2557}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary transitions between sex-determining mechanisms (SDMs) are
   an enigma. Among vertebrates, individual sex (male or female) is
   primarily determined by either genes (genotypic sex determination, GSD)
   or embryonic incubation temperature (temperature-dependent sex
   determination, TSD), and these mechanisms have undergone repeated
   evolutionary transitions. Despite this evolutionary lability,
   transitions from GSD (i.e. from male heterogamety, XX/XY, or female
   heterogamety, ZZ/ZW) to TSD are an evolutionary conundrum, as they
   appear to require crossing a fitness valley arising from the production
   of genotypes with reduced viability owing to being homogametic for
   degenerated sex chromosomes (YY or WW individuals). Moreover, it is
   unclear whether alternative (e.g. mixed) forms of sex determination can
   persist across evolutionary time. It has previously been suggested that
   transitions would be easy if temperature-dependent sex reversal (e.g. XX
   male or XY female) was asymmetrical, occurring only in the homogametic
   sex. However, only recently has a mechanistic model of sex determination
   emerged that may allow such asymmetrical sex reversal. We demonstrate
   that selection for TSD in a realistic sex-determining system can readily
   drive evolutionary transitions from GSD to TSD that do not require the
   production of YY or WW individuals. In XX/XY systems, sex reversal
   (female to male) occurs in a portion of the XX individuals only, leading
   to the loss of the Y allele (or chromosome) from the population as XX
   individuals mate with each other. The outcome is a population of XX
   individuals whose sex is determined by incubation temperature (TSD).
   Moreover, our model reveals a novel evolutionarily stable state
   representing a mixed-mechanism system that has not been revealed by
   previous approaches. This study solves two long-standing puzzles of the
   evolution of sex-determining mechanisms by illuminating the evolutionary
   pathways and endpoints.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3592-3606}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations are placing spatially divergent
   stresses on the world's tropical coral reefs through increasing ocean
   surface temperatures and ocean acidification. We show how these two
   stressors combine to alter the global habitat suitability for shallow
   coral reef ecosystems, using statistical Bioclimatic Envelope Models
   rather than basing projections on any a priori assumptions of
   physiological tolerances or fixed thresholds. We apply two different
   modeling approaches (Maximum Entropy and Boosted Regression Trees) with
   two levels of complexity (one a simplified and reduced environmental
   variable version of the other). Our models project a marked
   temperature-driven decline in habitat suitability for many of the most
   significant and bio-diverse tropical coral regions, particularly in the
   central Indo-Pacific. This is accompanied by a temperature-driven
   poleward range expansion of favorable conditions accelerating up to
   40-70km per decade by 2070. We find that ocean acidification is less
   influential for determining future habitat suitability than warming, and
   its deleterious effects are centered evenly in both hemispheres between
   5 degrees and 20 degrees latitude. Contrary to expectations, the
   combined impact of ocean surface temperature rise and acidification
   leads to little, if any, degradation in future habitat suitability
   across much of the Atlantic and areas currently considered marginal' for
   tropical corals, such as the eastern Equatorial Pacific. These results
   are consistent with fossil evidence of range expansions during past warm
   periods. In addition, the simplified models are particularly sensitive
   to short-term temperature variations and their projections correlate
   well with reported locations of bleaching events. Our approach offers
   new insights into the relative impact of two global environmental
   pressures associated with rising atmospheric CO2 on potential future
   habitats, but greater understanding of past and current controls on
   coral reef ecosystems is essential to their conservation and management

Abstract = {{Many groups show higher species richness in tropical regions but the
   underlying causes remain unclear. Despite many competing hypotheses to
   explain latitudinal diversity gradients, only three processes can
   directly change species richness across regions: speciation, extinction
   and dispersal. These processes can be addressed most powerfully using
   large-scale phylogenetic approaches, but most previous studies have
   focused on small groups and recent time scales, or did not separate
   speciation and extinction rates. We investigate the origins of high
   tropical diversity in amphibians, applying new phylogenetic comparative
   methods to a tree of 2871 species. Our results show that high tropical
   diversity is explained by higher speciation in the tropics, higher
   extinction in temperate regions and limited dispersal out of the tropics
   compared with colonization of the tropics from temperate regions. These
   patterns are strongly associated with climate-related variables such as
   temperature, precipitation and ecosystem energy. Results from models of
   diversity dependence in speciation rate suggest that temperate clades
   may have lower carrying capacities and may be more saturated (closer to
   carrying capacity) than tropical clades. Furthermore, we estimate
   strikingly low tropical extinction rates over geological time scales, in
   stark contrast to the dramatic losses of diversity occurring in tropical
   regions presently.}},

Abstract = {{The Red List classification of IUCN has become one of the most important
   evaluations of threats that affect biodiversity at the species level.
   However, many estimations of species range, one essential factor in the
   Red List classification, are derived from expert-based assessments that
   sometimes lack empirical evidence. Our study focused on the corncrake
   (Crex crex), a grassland Palaearctic bird whose conservation status has
   been revised recently following some new assessments of range and
   population size. However, the amount of data that form the basis of this
   reclassification appears weak compared to the large area involved. We
   used a method of species distribution modelling (MAXENT) to predict the
   corncrake range and confronted it to the expert-based map. We resolved
   the huge geographic bias in the distribution of presence points by using
   a relevant method of sampling bias correction. We found a rather similar
   distribution with the IUCN estimated range, although less widespread. We
   also highlighted a relationship between habitat suitability computed by
   the model and population estimates per country when the effect of
   agriculture intensity is taken into account. This result supports the
   current expert-based estimates of corncrake distribution and emphasizes
   that a relevant modelling strategy should be able to predict the
   distribution of a species even from a biased dataset. IUCN estimates of
   species' ranges would certainly benefit from a model-based approach in

Abstract = {{AimHigh gamma diversity in tropical montane forests may be ascribed to
   high geographical turnover of community composition, resulting from
   population isolation that leads to speciation. We studied the
   evolutionary processes responsible for diversity and turnover in
   assemblages of tropical scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae) by assessing DNA
   sequence variation at multiple hierarchical levels.
   LocationA 300-km transect across six montane forests (900-1100m) in
   Costa Rica.
   MethodsAssemblages of Scarabaeidae (subfamilies Dynastinae, Rutelinae,
   Melolonthinae) including 118 morphospecies and >500 individuals were
   sequenced for the cox1 gene to establish species limits with a mixed
   Yule-coalescent method. A species-level phylogenetic tree was
   constructed from cox1 and rrnL genes. Total diversity and turnover among
   assemblages were then assessed at three hierarchical levels: haplotypes,
   species and higher clades.
   ResultsDNA-based analyses showed high turnover among communities at all
   hierarchical levels. Turnover was highest at the haplotype level
   (community similarity 0.02-0.12) and decreased with each step of the
   hierarchy (species: 0.21-0.46; clades: 0.41-0.43). Both compositional
   and phylogenetic similarities of communities were geographically
   structured, but turnover was not correlated with distance among forests.
   When three major clades were investigated separately, communities of
   Dynastinae showed consistently higher alpha diversity, larger species
   ranges and lower turnover than Rutelinae and Melolonthinae.
   Main conclusionsScarab communities of montane forests show evidence of
   evolutionary persistence of communities in relative isolation,
   presumably tracking suitable habitats elevationally to accommodate
   climatic changes. Patterns of diversity on all hierarchical levels seem
   to be determined by restricted dispersal, and differences in Dynastinae
   could be explained by their greater dispersal ability. Community-wide
   DNA sequencing across multiple lineages and hierarchical levels reveals
   the evolutionary processes that led to high beta diversity in tropical
   montane forests through time.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{20-34}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Data from large-scale biological inventories are essential for
   understanding and managing Earth's ecosystems. The Forest Inventory and
   Analysis Program (FIA) of the U.S. Forest Service is the largest
   biological inventory in North America: however, the RA inventory
   recently changed from an amalgam of different approaches to a
   nationally-standardized approach in 2000. Full use of both data sets is
   clearly warranted to target many pressing research questions including
   those related to climate change and forest resources. However, full use
   requires lumping FIA data from different regionally-based designs
   (pre-2000) and/or lumping the data across the temporal changeover.
   Combining data from different inventory,types must be approached with
   caution as inventory types represent different probabilities of
   detecting trees per sample unit, which can ultimately confound temporal
   and spatial patterns found in the data. Consequently, the main goal of
   this study is to evaluate the effect of inventory on a common analysis
   in ecology, modeling of climatic niches (or species-climate relations).
   We use non-parametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) to build and
   compare niche models for 41 tree species from the old and new FIA design
   in the Pacific coastal United States. We discover two likely effects of
   inventory on niche models and their predictions. First, there is an
   increase from 4 to 6\% in random error for modeled predictions from the
   different inventories when compared to modeled predictions from two
   samples of the same inventory. Second, systematic error (or directional
   disagreement among modeled predictions) is detectable for 4 out of 41
   species among the different inventories: Calocedrus decurrens,
   Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Pinus ponderosa, and Abies concolor. Hence,
   at least 90\% of niche models and predictions of probability of
   occurrence demonstrate no obvious effect from the change in inventory
   design. Further, niche models built from sub-samples of the same data
   set can yield systematic error that rivals systematic error in
   predictions for models built from two separate data sets. This work
   corroborates the pervasive and pressing need to quantify different types
   of error in niche modeling to address issues associated with data
   quality and large-scale data integration. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{For maintaining social and financial support for eradication programs of
   invasive species, quantitative assessment of recovery of native species
   or ecosystems is important because it provides a measurable parameter of
   success. However, setting a concrete goal for recovery is often
   difficult owing to lack of information prior to the introduction of
   invaders. Here, we present a novel approach to evaluate the achievement
   level of invasive predator management based on the carrying capacity of
   endangered species estimated using long-term monitoring data. In
   Amami-Oshima Island, Japan, where the eradication project of introduced
   small Indian mongoose is ongoing since 2000, we surveyed the population
   densities of four endangered species threatened by the mongoose (Amami
   rabbit, the Otton frog, Amami tip-nosed frog, and Amami Ishikawa's frog)
   at four time points ranging from 2003 to 2011. We estimated the carrying
   capacities of these species using the logistic growth model combined
   with the effects of mongoose predation and environmental heterogeneity.
   All species showed clear tendencies toward increasing their density in
   line with decreased mongoose density, and they exhibited
   density-dependent population growth. The estimated carrying capacities
   of three endangered species had small confidence intervals enough to
   measure recovery levels by the mongoose management. The population
   density of each endangered species has recovered to the level of the
   carrying capacity at about 20-40\% of all sites, whereas no individuals
   were observed at more than 25\% of all sites. We propose that the
   present approach involving appropriate monitoring data of native
   organism populations will be widely applicable to various eradication
   projects and provide unambiguous goals for management of invasive
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Fidelity rates of pair-bonded individuals are of considerable interest
   to behavioral and population biologists as they can influence population
   structure, mating rates, population productivity, and gene flow.
   Estimates of fidelity rates calculated from direct observations of pairs
   in consecutive breeding seasons may be biased because (i) individuals
   that are not seen are assumed to be dead, (ii) variation in the
   detectability of individuals is ignored, and (iii) pair status must be
   known with certainty. This can lead to a high proportion of observations
   being ignored. This approach also restricts the way variation in
   fidelity rates for different types of individuals, or the covariation
   between fidelity and other vital rates (e.g., survival) can be analyzed.
   In this study, we develop a probabilistic multievent
   capture-mark-recapture (MECMR) modeling framework for estimating pair
   fidelity rates that accounts for imperfect detection rates and capture
   heterogeneity, explicitly incorporates uncertainty in the assessment of
   pair status, and allows estimates of state-dependent survival and
   fidelity rates to be obtained simultaneously. We demonstrate the utility
   of our approach for investigating patterns of fidelity in pair-bonded
   individuals, by applying it to 30years of breeding data from a wild
   population of great tits Parus major Linnaeus. Results of model
   selection supported state-dependent recapture, survival, and fidelity
   rates. Recapture rates were higher for individuals breeding with their
   previous partner than for those breeding with a different partner.
   Faithful birds that were breeding with the same partner as in the
   previous breeding season (i.e., at t-1) experienced substantially higher
   survival rates (between t and t+1) and were also more likely to remain
   faithful to their current partner (i.e., to remain in the faithful state
   at t+1). First year breeders were more likely to change partner than
   older birds. These findings imply that traditional estimates, which do
   not account for state-dependent parameters, may be both inaccurate and
   biased, and hence, inferences based on them may conceal important
   biological effects. This was demonstrated in the analysis of simulated
   capture histories, which showed that our MECMR model was able to
   estimate state-dependant survival and pair fidelity rates in the face of
   varying state-dependant recapture rates robustly, and more accurately,
   than the traditional method. In addition, this new modeling approach
   provides a statistically rigorous framework for testing hypothesis about
   the causes and consequences of fidelity to a partner for natural
   populations. The novel modeling approach described here can readily be
   applied, either in its current form or via extension, to other
   populations and other types of dyadic interactions (e.g., between
   nonpaired individuals, such as parent-offspring relationships, or
   between individuals and locations, such as nest-site fidelity).}},

Abstract = {{1.If animals moved randomly in space, the use of different habitats
   would be proportional to their availability. Hence, deviations from
   proportionality between use and availability are considered the
   tell-tale sign of preference. This principle forms the basis for most
   habitat selection and species distribution models fitted to
   use-availability or count data (e.g. MaxEnt and Resource Selection
   Functions). Yet, once an essential habitat type is sufficiently abundant
   to meet an individual's needs, increased availability of this habitat
   type may lead to a decrease in the use/availability ratio. Accordingly,
   habitat selection functions may estimate negative coefficients when
   habitats are superabundant, incorrectly suggesting an apparent
   avoidance. Furthermore, not accounting for the effects of availability
   on habitat use may lead to poor predictions, particularly when applied
   to habitats that differ considerably from those for which data have been
   collected. Using simulations, we show that habitat use varies
   non-linearly with habitat availability, even when individuals follow
   simple movement rules to acquire food and avoid risk. The results show
   that the impact of availability strongly depends on the type of habitat
   (e.g. whether it is essential or substitutable) and how it interacts
   with the distribution and availability of other habitats. We demonstrate
   the utility of a variety of existing and new methods that enable the
   influence of habitat availability to be explicitly estimated. Models
   that allow for non-linear effects (using b-spline smoothers) and
   interactions between environmental covariates defining habitats and
   measures of their availability were best able to capture simulated
   patterns of habitat use across a range of environments. An appealing
   aspect of some of the methods we discuss is that the relative influence
   of availability is not defined a priori, but directly estimated by the
   model. This feature is likely to improve model prediction, hint at the
   mechanism of habitat selection, and may signpost habitats that are
   critical for the organism's fitness.}},

Abstract = {{1. Body condition plays a fundamental role in many ecological and
   evolutionary processes at a variety of scales and across a broad range
   of animal taxa. An understanding of how body condition changes at fine
   spatial and temporal scales as a result of interaction with the
   environment provides necessary information about how animals acquire
   resources. However, comparatively little is known about intra- and
   interindividual variation of condition in marine systems. Where
   condition has been studied, changes typically are recorded at relatively
   coarse time-scales. By quantifying how fine-scale interaction with the
   environment influences condition, we can broaden our understanding of
   how animals acquire resources and allocate them to body stores. Here we
   used a hierarchical Bayesian state-space model to estimate the body
   condition as measured by the size of an animal's lipid store in two
   closely related species of marine predator that occupy different
   hemispheres: northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and
   southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina). The observation model linked
   drift dives to lipid stores. The process model quantified daily changes
   in lipid stores as a function of the physiological condition of the seal
   (lipid:lean tissue ratio, departure lipid and departure mass), its
   foraging location, two measures of behaviour and environmental
   covariates. We found that physiological condition significantly impacted
   lipid gain at two time-scales - daily and at departure from the colony -
   that foraging location was significantly associated with lipid gain in
   both species of elephant seals and that long-term behavioural phase was
   associated with positive lipid gain in northern and southern elephant
   seals. In northern elephant seals, the occurrence of short-term
   behavioural states assumed to represent foraging were correlated with
   lipid gain. Lipid gain was a function of covariates in both species.
   Southern elephant seals performed fewer drift dives than northern
   elephant seals and gained lipids at a lower rate. We have demonstrated a
   new way to obtain time series of body condition estimates for a marine
   predator at fine spatial and temporal scales. This modelling approach
   accounts for uncertainty at many levels and has the potential to
   integrate physiological and movement ecology of top predators. The
   observation model we used was specific to elephant seals, but the
   process model can readily be applied to other species, providing an
   opportunity to understand how animals respond to their environment at a
   fine spatial scale.}},

Abstract = {{Activity budgets can provide a direct link to an animals bioenergetic
   budget and is thus a valuable unit of measure when assessing
   human-induced nonlethal effects on wildlife conservation status.
   However, activity budget inference can be challenging for species that
   are difficult to observe and require multiple observational variables.
   Here, we assessed whether whalewatching boat interactions could affect
   the activity budgets of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). We
   used a stepwise modeling approach to quantitatively record, identify,
   and assign activity states to continuous behavioral time series data, to
   estimate activity budgets. First, we used multiple behavioral variables,
   recorded from continuous visual observations of individual animals, to
   quantitatively identify and define behavioral types. Activity states
   were then assigned to each sampling unit, using a combination of hidden
   and observed states. Three activity states were identified: nonfeeding,
   foraging, and surface feeding (SF). From the resulting time series of
   activity states, transition probability matrices were estimated using
   first-order Markov chains. We then simulated time series of activity
   states, using Monte Carlo methods based on the transition probability
   matrices, to obtain activity budgets, accounting for heterogeneity in
   state duration. Whalewatching interactions reduced the time whales spend
   foraging and SF, potentially resulting in an overall decrease in energy
   intake of 42\%. This modeling approach thus provides a means to link
   short-term behavioral changes resulting from human disturbance to
   potential long-term bioenergetic consequences in animals. It also
   provides an analytical framework applicable to other species when direct
   observations of activity states are not possible.}},

Abstract = {{AimDespite the recent improvements made in species distribution models

   LocationEurope.
   MethodsWe simulated the post-glacial colonization of European beech over
   the last 12,000 years by coupling a process-based SDM (PHENOFIT) and a
   new migration model based on Gibbs point processes, both parameterized
   with modern ecological data. Simulations were compared with
   palaeoarchives and phylogeographic data on European beech.
   ResultsModel predictions are consistent with palaeoarchives and
   phylogeographic data over the Holocene. The results suggest that
   post-glacial expansion of European beech was limited by climate on its
   north-eastern leading edge, while limited by its migration abilities on
   its north-western leading edge. The results show a mean migration rate
   of beech varying from 270myr (-1) to 280myr(-1) and a maximum migration
   rate varying from 560myr(-1) to 630myr(-1), when limited and not limited
   by climate, respectively. They also highlight the relative contribution
   of known and suspected glacial refugia in present beech distribution and
   confirm the results of phylogeographic studies.
   Main conclusionsFor the first time, we were able to reproduce accurately
   the colonization dynamics of European beech during the last 12kyr using
   a process-based SDM and a migration model, both parameterized with
   modern ecological data. Our methodology has allowed us to identify the
   different factors that affected European beech migration during its
   post-glaciation expansion in different parts of its range. This method
   shows great potential to help palaeobotanists and phylogeographers
   locate putative glacial refugia, and to provide accurate projections of

Abstract = {{Climate change-driven stressors threaten the persistence of coral reefs

   French Polynesia, and a network theoretic modeling approach to evaluate
   how patterns in coral-Symbiodinium associations influence community
   stability under climate change. To introduce the effect of climate
   perturbations, we simulate local extinctions' that represent either the
   loss of coral species or the ability to engage in symbiotic
   interactions. Community stability is measured by determining the
   duration and number of species that persist through the simulated
   extinctions. Our results suggest that four factors greatly increase
   coral-Symbiodinium community stability in response to global changes:
   (i) the survival of generalist hosts and symbionts maximizes potential
   symbiotic unions; (ii) elevated symbiont diversity provides redundant or
   complementary symbiotic functions; (iii) compatible symbiotic
   assemblages create the potential for local recolonization; and (iv) the
   persistence of certain traits associate with symbiotic diversity and
   redundancy. Symbiodinium may facilitate coral persistence through novel
   environmental regimes, but this capacity is mediated by symbiotic
   specificity, association patterns, and the functional performance of the
   symbionts. Our model-based approach identifies general trends and

Abstract = {{Changes in climate, in combination with intensive exploitation of marine
   resources, have caused large-scale reorganizations in many of the
   world's marine ecosystems during the past decades. The Baltic Sea in
   Northern Europe is one of the systems most affected. In addition to
   being exposed to persistent eutrophication, intensive fishing, and one
   of the world's fastest rates of warming in the last two decades of the
   20th century, accelerated climate change including atmospheric warming
   and changes in precipitation is projected for this region during the
   21st century. Here, we used a new multimodel approach to project how the
   interaction of climate, nutrient loads, and cod fishing may affect the
   future of the open Central Baltic Sea food web. Regionally downscaled
   global climate scenarios were, in combination with three nutrient load
   scenarios, used to drive an ensemble of three regional biogeochemical
   models (BGMs). An Ecopath with Ecosim food web model was then forced
   with the BGM results from different nutrient-climate scenarios in
   combination with two different cod fishing scenarios. The results showed
   that regional management is likely to play a major role in determining
   the future of the Baltic Sea ecosystem. By the end of the 21st century,
   for example, the combination of intensive cod fishing and high nutrient
   loads projected a strongly eutrophicated and sprat-dominated ecosystem,
   whereas low cod fishing in combination with low nutrient loads resulted
   in a cod-dominated ecosystem with eutrophication levels close to
   present. Also, nonlinearities were observed in the sensitivity of
   different trophic groups to nutrient loads or fishing depending on the
   combination of the two. Finally, many climate variables and species
   biomasses were projected to levels unseen in the past. Hence, the risk
   for ecological surprises needs to be addressed, particularly when the

Abstract = {{The concept of ecological memory provides a new perspective for research

   state of ecological processes. However, there are still significant gaps
   between the concept and its application. We selected nine proxy
   indicators (plant species, soil seed banks, soil microbes, soil animals,
   birds, soil age, soil pollen, soil mineral distribution, and light
   environment) and developed a method to quantify ecological memory and
   succession in a subtropical forest succession in South China. Taking the
   climax-monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest as the reference ecosystem,
   we found that ecological memory increased nonlinearly and accumulated
   following a specific assembly rule during succession. Memory concerning
   major soil microbes and soil animals, which improve the soil substrate,
   mainly accumulated from the initial to the early successional stage.
   Memory concerning the number of bird species and the availability of
   light, which ensure a source of regenerative seeds and the survival of
   understory seedlings, mainly accumulated from the early to middle
   successional stages. Memory concerning vegetation and soil seed banks
   mainly accumulated late in succession, guaranteeing that the ecosystem
   would reach the regional climax stage. Prospective memory was greater
   than retrospective memory in every successional stage except the late
   stage, which indicated that all stages but the late stage were
   undergoing progressive succession. Our study demonstrates that the
   concept of ecological memory and the proposed evaluation framework are
   useful for guiding research on succession and restoration, and
   especially for assessing how ``far{''} a restored ecosystem is from a
   reference ecosystem or how far a restored ecosystem has deviated from

Abstract = {{Water scarcity has become widespread all over the world. Current methods
   for water scarcity assessment are mainly based on water quantity and
   seldom consider water quality. Here, we develop a simple approach for
   assessing water scarcity considering both water quantity and quality. In
   this approach, a new water scarcity index is used to describe the
   severity of water scarcity in the form of a water scarcity meter, which
   may help to communicate water scarcity to a wider audience. To
   illustrate the approach, we analyzed the historical trend of water
   scarcity for Beijing city in China during 1995-2009. The results show
   that Beijing made a huge progress in mitigating water scarcity, and that
   from 1999 to 2009 the blue and grey water scarcity index decreased by
   59\% and 62\%, respectively. These achievements were made through great
   efforts of water-saving measures and wastewater treatment. Despite this
   progress, we demonstrate that Beijing is still characterized by serious
   water scarcity due to both water quantity and quality. The water
   scarcity index remained at a high value of 3.5 with a blue and grey
   water scarcity index of 1.2 and 2.3 in 2009 (exceeding the thresholds of
   0.4 and 1, respectively). As a result of unsustainable water use and
   pollution, groundwater levels continue to decline, and water quality
   shows a continuously deteriorating trend. To curb this trend, future
   water policies should further decrease water withdrawal from local
   sources (in particular groundwater) within Beijing, and should limit the
   grey water footprint below the total amount of water resources. (c) 2013

Title = {{Degradation of cultivated bench terraces in the Three Gorges Area: Field
   mapping and data mining}},

Abstract = {{Due to resettlements, construction of new infrastructure, and new land
   reclamation the rapid agricultural changes in the Three Georges Area
   (TGA) in Central China are expected to force the degradation of the
   cultivated terraced landscape. Consequently, increased soil erosion can
   hamper a sustainable land management in the mountainous TGA. This paper
   presents the model framework TerraCE (Terrace Condition Erosion) for
   determining the causes for different terrace conditions and terrace
   degradation based on field surveys and spatial data mining. For a total
   of 987 bench terrace plots in the Xiangxi catchment we collected data on
   their state of maintenance and terrace design to account for terrace
   stability and thus capability of soil conservation. Assessing the
   driving factors of terrace degradation was done by embedding
   terrain-based predictors and distance-transforms of remote-sensing data
   as indicators of environmental and anthropogenic influences. Random
   forests classification and regression models were applied for data
   mining. Terrace degradation in the Xiangxi catchment is obvious. The
   sequence of degradation ranges from `well maintained' (21\%), `fairly
   maintained' (44\%), and `partially collapsed' (23\%) to `completely
   collapsed' (11\%) terraces. The cross-validation error of the supervised
   TerraCE model is below 8\%, allowing for reasonable and valid
   interpretations of the causes of terrace degradation. Data mining
   reveals indicators for anthropogenic effects such as the distance to
   settlements or to roads as major drivers for the spatial distribution of
   terrace conditions. The effect of relief, which can be regarded as the
   major natural driver for terrace degradation by erosive action is
   tributary but altered and overlaid by land use dynamics associated with
   the Three Gorges Dam. An important indicator representing a combined
   effect of terrain and human activity is the distance to stream channels
   of different orders. Applying TerraCE we reveal mechanisms of terrace
   degradation in disturbed environments and present a framework for
   standardized mapping and analysis of terrace degradation under
   cultivation. The approach might also be used to develop guidelines for
   terrace planning in mountainous terraced landscapes of limited carrying
   capacity, with respect to socio-economic as well as environmental
   conditions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Botany Bay Plantation Wildlife Management Area is one of only four known
   natural nesting sites for least terns (Sternula antillarum) on the South
   Carolina coast, and more than 20,000 people visit the 3-mile stretch of
   beach each nesting season since it opened to the public in 2008. We
   developed a simulation model for the adaptive management of human
   disturbance on nesting habitat for least terns, which is described using
   the ODD (Overview, Design Concepts, and Details) protocol. The
   simulation uses the Questions and Decisions (QnD) system framework, an
   object-oriented modeling approach that emphasizes interactions among key
   ecological and social components. The model is designed to explore the
   potential results of management actions and identify key indicators for
   future monitoring. Initial model parameters were developed from existing
   literature, expert opinion and on-site ecological observations as few
   baseline data were available for the recently opened site. In addition,
   substantial uncertainty surrounded the nesting behavior of least terns
   related to productivity levels, responses to human disturbance, and
   overwash tides. In order to test model assumptions and performance,
   parameters are assigned stochastic probability distributions made
   explicit to wildlife managers and can be updated as additional
   monitoring data become available. Simulation results suggest that Botany
   Bay colonies are at significant risk of collapse. Monte Carlo
   simulations of the model (n=500) show that current management practices
   result in a median productivity of 0.08 fledglings per breeding adult,
   well below the minimum productivity threshold of 0.13 needed to
   encourage site fidelity. But closing one particular section of beach
   during the nesting season would result in a global median productivity
   of 0.26. A sensitivity analysis identified one variable in particular as
   important to monitor for reducing uncertainty in model results: the
   duration of tern defense response from human disturbance and the
   variation of this response among spatial units. These simulation results
   are intended to initiate an ongoing and adaptive monitoring program for
   improving colony productivity at the site. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Analyses of animal movement data have primarily focused on understanding
   patterns of space use and the behavioural processes driving them. Here,
   we analyzed animal movement data to infer components of individual
   fitness, specifically parturition and neonate survival. We predicted
   that parturition and neonate loss events could be identified by sudden
   and marked changes in female movement patterns. Using GPS
   radio-telemetry data from female woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus
   caribou), we developed and tested two novel movement-based methods for
   inferring parturition and neonate survival. The first method estimated
   movement thresholds indicative of parturition and neonate loss from
   population-level data then applied these thresholds in a moving-window
   analysis on individual time-series data. The second method used an
   individual-based approach that discriminated among three a priori models
   representing the movement patterns of non-parturient females, females
   with surviving offspring, and females losing offspring. The models
   assumed that step lengths (the distance between successive GPS
   locations) were exponentially distributed and that abrupt changes in the
   scale parameter of the exponential distribution were indicative of
   parturition and offspring loss. Both methods predicted parturition with
   near certainty (>97\% accuracy) and produced appropriate predictions of
   parturition dates. Prediction of neonate survival was affected by data
   quality for both methods; however, when using high quality data (i.e.,
   with few missing GPS locations), the individual-based method performed
   better, predicting neonate survival status with an accuracy rate of
   87\%. Understanding ungulate population dynamics often requires
   estimates of parturition and neonate survival rates. With GPS
   radio-collars increasingly being used in research and management of
   ungulates, our movement-based methods represent a viable approach for
   estimating rates of both parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Classifying the states of an individual and quantifying transitions
   between states are crucial while modeling animal behavior, movement, and
   physiologic status. When these states are hidden or imperfectly known,
   it is particularly convenient to relate them to appropriate quantitative
   measurements taken on the individual. This task is, however, challenging
   when quantitative measurements are not available at each sampling
   occasion. For capture-recapture data, various ways of incorporating such
   non-discrete information have been used, but they are either ad hoc
   and/or use a fraction of the available information by relying on a
   priori thresholds to assign individual states. Here we propose assigning
   discrete states based on a continuous measurement, and then modeled
   survival and transition probabilities based on these assignments. The
   main advantage of this new approach is that a more informative use of
   the non-discrete information is done. As an illustrative working
   example, we applied this approach to eco-epidemiological data collected
   across a series of years in which individuals of a long-lived seabird,
   the Black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), could either be visually
   detected or physically recaptured and blood sampled for subsequent

Abstract = {{AimConservation strategies need predictions that capture spatial

   generate these predictive maps generally focus on deterministic
   processes and omit stochasticity and other uncertainty in model outputs.
   Here we present a novel approach to model the means and variance of
   assemblage properties.
   LocationThe western Swiss Alps.
   MethodsWe propose a new approach to processing probabilistic predictions
   derived from stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) in order to
   predict and assess the uncertainty in predictions of community
   properties. We compare the utility of our novel approach with that of a
   traditional threshold-based approach. We used data sampled in 2009 and
   2010 from 192 sites in total for mountain butterfly communities spanning
   a large elevational gradient as a case study and evaluated the ability
   of our approach to model the species richness and phylogenetic diversity
   of communities within an ensemble forecasting framework.
   ResultsOur approach allowed mapping of the variability in species
   richness and phylogenetic diversity projections, in addition to the
   mean, for 78 butterfly species. S-SDMs reproduced the observed decrease
   in phylogenetic diversity and species richness with elevation, a
   consequence of environmental filtering. The prediction accuracy of
   community properties varied along environmental gradients: at low
   elevations, variability was higher for predictions of species richness
   while it was the opposite for phylogenetic diversity.
   Main conclusionsThe use of our probabilistic approach to process species
   distribution model outputs in order to reconstruct communities provides
   an improved picture of the range of possible assemblage realizations
   under similar environmental conditions given modelling uncertainty, and
   helps to inform managers of the usefulness of modelling results.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers and natural resource managers need predictions of how
   multiple global changes (e.g., climate change, rising levels of air
   pollutants, exotic invasions) will affect landscape composition and
   ecosystem function. Ecological predictive models used for this purpose
   are constructed using either a mechanistic (process-based) or a
   phenomenological (empirical) approach, or combination. Given the
   accelerating pace of global changes, it is becoming increasingly
   difficult to trust future projections made by phenomenological models
   estimated under past conditions. Using forest landscape models as an
   example, I review current modeling approaches and propose principles for
   developing the next generation of landscape models. First, modelers
   should increase the use of mechanistic components based on appropriately
   scaled ``first principles{''} even though such an approach is not
   without cost and limitations. Second, the interaction of processes
   within a model should be designed to minimize a priori constraints on
   process interactions and mimic how interactions play out in real life.
   Third, when a model is expected to make accurate projections of future
   system states it must include all of the major ecological processes that
   structure the system. A completely mechanistic approach to the molecular
   level is not tractable or desirable at landscape scales. I submit that
   the best solution is to blend mechanistic and phenomenological
   approaches in a way that maximizes the use of mechanisms where novel
   driver conditions are expected while keeping the model tractable. There
   may be other ways. I challenge landscape ecosystem modelers to seek new
   ways to make their models more robust to the multiple global changes

Abstract = {{Hierarchical clustering of molecular data is commonly used for
   estimation of species diversity in all forms of life. Parameters
   appropriate for species-level clustering are usually derived from
   reference data and applied for the delineation of sequences of unknown
   species membership, although it is not clear how this should be carried
   out in a multilocus scenario. We introduce a novel means of concurrent
   clustering parameter optimization and delineation for multilocus data. A
   simulated annealing heuristic search is performed, whereby clustering
   thresholds are independently varied for each locus, but optimized
   according to the recovery of expected taxonomic species globally over
   loci. For each iteration of the search, one or more loci are randomly
   selected and a different threshold is separately proposed to cluster
   each, then the loci are linked to form global species units. Where the
   set of thresholds group the reference (species labelled) data with high
   taxonomic congruence, they are adopted for clustering of the subject
   (nonlabelled) sequences into global molecular operational taxonomic
   units (global MOTU). Four mined test data sets composed of both
   reference and subject sequences are combined with a newly sequenced
   three gene Apoidea data set, and subject to the proposed method. Even
   optimizing four loci and thousands of sequences, the approach rapidly
   convergences on a set of parameters with maximal optimality score,
   although the method masks a high degree of incongruence, and does not
   always converge on a single set of thresholds. For example, of the 476
   Apoidea sequences, 70 global MOTU were inferred over the heuristic
   search, although the number of single gene MOTU were much lower for the
   28S RNA locus, and a range of equally optimal clustering thresholds were
   observed for the CytB gene. We demonstrate the approach as a scalable
   species delineation solution for heterogeneous data sets composed of
   incompletely and inconsistently labelled data from public DNA data
   bases, for newly sequenced multilocus data, or both. The delineation
   over a heuristic search of clustering parameters facilitates the
   estimation of species diversity in multilocus data, giving species
   estimates that take into account uncertainty regarding choice of
   clustering thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{Feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are a widespread invasive species, and cause

   Exclosure cages were erected over feral pig-disturbed ground and
   visually undisturbed ground (the latter as controls). Buried resin bags
   and litter bags were located in these plots to examine differences in
   soil nutrients and decomposition rates and seedling/sapling recruitment
   (abundance, species composition and richness) was monitored over 21
   months. No difference was found in the litter decomposition between the
   disturbed and visually undisturbed plots. Significantly more nitrate
   (NO3-N/NO2-N) was found in the disturbed exclosures. Seedling density
   was not significantly affected by feral pig disturbance. However,
   seedling/sapling species richness was lower in disturbed areas. Species
   composition changes occurred at disturbed sites with species increasing
   and decreasing in density after feral pig disturbance. However, no

   feral pig disturbance. This study shows that feral pig disturbance
   affects vegetation through direct removal, but also indirectly through
   increased nitrate, potentially leading to seedling and sapling species
   composition changes. Feral pigs are known to return to previously
   disturbed areas to re-disturb. These areas may remain in a re-disturbed
   state if not protected, and through continued disturbance and increased
   nitrate, ecosystem changes may occur, especially in characteristically

Abstract = {{Coordination of group actions in social organisms is often a
   self-organised process lacking central control. These collective
   behaviours are driven by mechanisms of positive feedback generated
   through information exchange. Understanding how different methods of
   communication generate positive feedback is an essential step in
   comprehending the functional mechanisms underlying complex systems. The
   Japanese small-colony ant, Myrmecina nipponica uses both pheromone
   trails and an apparent quorum response during consensus decisions over a
   new home. Both of these mechanisms have been shown to generate positive
   feedback and are effective means of selecting among mutually exclusive
   courses of action. In this study, I investigate how pheromone trails and
   quorum thresholds contribute to consensus decisions during house-hunting
   in this species through experimental manipulations of pheromone trails,
   colony size and environmental context. Results demonstrate that (1)
   providing colonies with pre-established pheromone trails increased the
   number of ants finding the new site and led to higher quorum thresholds
   and more rapid relocations, (2) experimentally halving colony size
   resulted in a proportional decrease in quorum thresholds and (3)
   colonies relocating long distances had higher quorums than those
   relocating short distances. Taken together, these data indicate that
   pheromone trails are important for recruitment and navigation during
   nest site selection, but that decision making is contingent on a quorum
   response. Such synergy between mechanisms of positive feedback may be a
   common means of optimising collective behaviours.}},

   river-flow variability on interstitial residence times, flowpath sizes
   and solute influx suggests that flow variability also affects
   longitudinal gradients in parafluvial zones.
   2. We studied associations between longitudinal gradients and flow
   variation in the forms of flow fluctuations and variable water sources.
   We used data from parafluvial zones in a New Zealand river to test four
   predictions: (i) longitudinal gradients in solutes, invertebrates and
   microbial activity are steeper in runoff-dominated losing and neutral
   reaches compared with groundwater-dominated gaining reaches; (ii)
   moderate-to-large floods eliminate longitudinal gradients, which reform
   during recessions; (iii) between floods, gradients in parafluvial
   chemistry change in steepness and direction in response to changes in
   river-flow levels; and (iv) between floods, invertebrate abundance and
   diversity are positively related to river flow.
   3. In Study 1, we measured solute concentrations, invertebrate
   composition and microbial activity over a range of flow levels in
   vegetated gravel bars with contrasting water sources (alluvial
   groundwater in a gaining reach, and hillslope runoff in losing and
   neutral reaches). In Study 2, we made repeated measurements in
   unvegetated gravel bars before and after a one-in-2-year flood to assess
   its effects on longitudinal gradients in nutrients and invertebrate
   communities.
   4. In Study 1, we detected gradients along parafluvial flowpaths in
   NO3-, dissolved reactive phosphorus and major ion concentrations and in
   pH, electrical conductivity and invertebrate density. There was little
   congruence between bars in different reaches, or among variables; some
   gradients became steeper as flow increased, and others shifted from
   negative to positive or vice versa or approached zero. Parafluvial
   chemistry was strongly affected by water source; median concentrations
   of most solutes were 2-20 times higher in the groundwater-dominated
   parafluvial zone than in the runoff-dominated parafluvial zones.
   5. Prior to the flood during Study 2, the parafluvial zones were
   characterised by negative longitudinal gradients in dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic N (DON) and positive gradients in
   NO3-. These gradients were eliminated by the flood, but NO3- and DOC
   gradients redeveloped during the post-flood period. Differences between
   the steepness and direction of gradients in Study 1 and the pre-flood
   period in Study 2 may be related to differences in terrestrial
   vegetation, as well as differences in flow regimes.
   6. Associations between river-flow levels and parafluvial invertebrate
   communities differed in the two studies, which corresponded to different
   flow ranges. Invertebrate density and taxon richness were positively
   correlated with flow over a range of low flows in Study 1, but there was
   no detectable correlation over a range of high flows in Study 2. These
   results suggest that beneficial effects of flow fluctuations on
   invertebrate communities peak at moderate flow levels, beyond which
   invertebrate-flow relationships become unstable.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing urgency for integration and coordination of global
   environmental and ecological data and indicators required to respond to
   the `grand challenges' the planet is facing, including climate change
   and biodiversity decline. A consistent stratification of land into
   relatively homogenous strata provides a valuable spatial framework for
   comparison and analysis of ecological and environmental data across
   large heterogeneous areas. We discuss how statistical stratification can
   be used to design national, European and global biodiversity observation
   networks. The value of strategic ecological survey based on stratified
   samples is first illustrated using the United Kingdom (UK) Countryside
   Survey, a national monitoring programme that has measured ecological
   change in the UK countryside for the last 35 years. We then present a
   design for a European-wide sampling design for monitoring common
   habitats, and discuss ways of extending these approaches globally,
   supported by the recently developed Global Environmental Stratification.
   The latter provides a robust spatial analytical framework for the
   identification of gaps in current monitoring efforts, and systematic
   design of new complementary monitoring and research. Examples from
   Portugal and the transboundary Kailash Sacred Landscape in the Himalayas
   illustrate the potential use of this stratification, which has been
   identified as a focal geospatial dataset within the Group on Earth

Abstract = {{Species distributions models (SDMs) are commonly used to assess
   potential species' range shifts or extinction risk under climate change.
   It has been suggested that the use of ensemble forecasts, where a
   variety of model algorithms are used to generate consensus predictions,
   are preferred to individual SDMs by avoiding bias or prediction error
   inherent in a single modeling approach. Whereas several studies have
   assessed the performance of ensemble predictions using cross-validation
   or data-partitioning approaches, few studies have assessed the
   predictive accuracy of ensemble forecasts under climate change by using
   temporally independent model validation data. We used five SDM
   approaches to develop consensus forecasts of distributions of 145
   vascular plant species from California in the 1930s and tested their
   projections against current distributions, a span of approximately 75
   years. When evaluated with a portion of the model training data,
   consensus forecasts were highly accurate with an average AUC value of
   0.97. False positive and false negative error rates were also low,
   exhibiting similar performance to random forest models. However, when
   evaluated with temporally independent data, the accuracy of consensus
   forecasts was similar to that of generalized linear and generalized
   additive models, with an average AUC value of 0.83. Our results suggest
   that the high levels of predictive accuracy exhibited by consensus
   forecasts when using data partitioning approaches may not reflect their
   performance when predicting temporally independent data. We contend that
   consensus forecasts may not represent the best approach for predicting
   species distributions under future climatic change, as they may not
   provide superior predictive accuracy in novel temporal domains compared
   to traditional modeling approaches that more readily lend themselves to
   ecological interpretation of model structure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Endangered species conservation planning needs to consider the effects
   of future climate change. Species distribution models are commonly used
   to predict future shifts in habitat suitability. We evaluated the
   effects of climate change on the highly endangered mountain gorilla
   (Gorilla beringei beringei) using a variety of modeling approaches, and
   assessing model outputs from the perspective of three spatial habitat
   management strategies: status quo, expansion and relocation. We show
   that alternative assumptions about the ecological niche of mountain
   gorillas can have a very large effect on model predictions. ` Standard'
   correlative models using 18 climatic predictor variables suggested that
   by 2090 there would be no suitable habitat left for the mountain gorilla
   in its existing parks, whereas a `limiting-factor' model, that uses a
   proxy of primary productivity, suggested that climate suitability would
   not change much. Species distribution models based on fewer predictor
   variables, on alternative assumptions about niche conservatism
   (including or excluding the other subspecies Gorilla beringii graueri),
   and a model based on gorilla behavior, had intermediate predictions.
   These alternative models show strong variation, and, in contrast to the
   standard approach with 18 variables, suggest that mountain gorilla
   habitat in the parks may remain suitable, that protected areas could be
   expanded into lower (warmer) areas, and that there might be
   climactically suitable habitat in other places where new populations
   could possibly be established. Differences among model predictions point
   to avenues for model improvement and further research. Similarities
   among model predictions point to possible areas for climate change
   adaptation management. For species with narrow distributions, such as
   the mountain gorilla, modeling the impact of climate change should be
   based on careful evaluation of their biology, particularly of the
   factors that currently appear to limit their distribution, and should
   avoid the naive application of standard correlative methods with many
   predictor variables.}},

Abstract = {{The migration of animals across long distances and between multiple
   habitats presents a major challenge for conservation. For the migratory
   Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana), these
   challenges include identifying and protecting migratory routes and
   critical roosts in two countries, the United States and Mexico.
   Knowledge and conservation of bat migratory routes is critical in the
   face of increasing threats from climate change and wind turbines that
   might decrease migratory survival. We employ a new modeling approach for
   bat migration, network modeling, to simulate migratory routes between
   winter habitat in southern Mexico and summer breeding habitat in
   northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. We use the model to
   identify key migratory routes and the roosts of greatest conservation
   value to the overall population. We measure roost importance by the
   degree to which the overall bat population declined when the roost was
   removed from the model. The major migratory routes-those with the
   greatest number of migrants-were between winter habitat in southern
   Mexico and summer breeding roosts in Texas and the northern Mexican
   states of Sonora and Nuevo Leon. The summer breeding roosts in Texas,
   Sonora, and Nuevo Leon were the most important for maintaining
   population numbers and network structure -these are also the largest
   roosts. This modeling approach contributes to conservation efforts by
   identifying the most influential areas for bat populations, and can be
   used to as a tool to improve our understanding of bat migration for
   other species. We anticipate this approach will help direct coordination
   of habitat protection across borders.}},

   undermines both the permitting process and conservation efforts of the

Abstract = {{The performance of many desert plant species in North America may

   productivity. We paired repeat measurements of plant canopy cover with
   climate at multiple sites across the Chihuahuan Desert over the last
   century to determine which plant species and functional types may be the
   most sensitive to climate change. We found that the dominant perennial
   grass, Bouteloua eriopoda, and species richness had nonlinear responses
   to summer precipitation, decreasing more in dry summers than increasing
   with wet summers. Dominant shrub species responded differently to the
   seasonality of precipitation and drought, but winter precipitation best
   explained changes in the cover of woody vegetation in upland grasslands
   and may contribute to woody-plant encroachment that is widespread

   Temperature explained additional variability of changes in cover of
   dominant and subdominant plant species. Using a novel empirically based
   approach we identified climate pivot points that were indicative of
   shifts from increasing to decreasing plant cover over a range of
   climatic conditions. Reductions in cover of annual and several perennial

   life-history traits that permit population density to vary in different
   ways in response to key spatial drivers, conditioned by the processes of
   global change. 3) They can be used to explore and rank the cost
   effectiveness of regional conservation alternatives and demographically

Abstract = {{Landscape change may reduce the connectivity of landscapes and impact
   the movement of animals. If movement processes have been influenced by
   landscape connectivity, we hypothesize that animals may distribute
   themselves in larger connected regions of the landscape in order to
   minimize the movement costs associated with obtaining required resources
   and avoiding predators. We adopt the term functional grain to describe a
   set of functionally connected regions. In this spatial pattern, each
   region describes a contiguous area of the landscape within which an
   animal may move freely below a threshold amount of movement cost. We
   used telemetry data from woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou to
   test hypothetical functional grains where connectivity was determined by
   the spatial configuration of resource patches (patch only), by the
   resistance to movement presented by landscape features (resistance
   only), and by a combination of the two (patch + resistance). To identify
   these functional grains, we used a grains of connectivity approach, and
   introduced a novel lattice-based variant of this method to build the
   resistance only model. We developed a measure of fit that describes
   caribou distribution with respect to larger functionally connected
   regions in the grain, and used this to ask: 1) are seasonal caribou
   locations consistent with a random functional grain, implying that
   landscape connectivity has not shaped their distribution? 2) Given a
   functional grain model, are seasonal caribou locations distributed in
   larger functionally connected regions than random points, implying a
   response to the shape, size, and location of the connected regions. We
   found support for landscape connectivity influencing animal distribution
   using grains based on a landscape resistance model, and that support
   varied between behaviourally defined seasons. We also discuss how our
   novel lattice approach may be valuable for highly mobile mammals and

Abstract = {{Shifts in disturbance regime have often been linked to invasion in
   systems by native and nonnative species. This process can have negative
   effects on biodiversity and ecosystem function. Degradation may be
   ameliorated by the reinstatement of the disturbance regimes, such as the
   reintroduction of fire in pyrogenic systems. Modeling is one method
   through which potential outcomes of different regimes can be
   investigated. We created a population model to examine the control of a
   native invasive that is expanding and increasing in abundance due to
   suppressed fire. Our model, parameterized with field data from a case
   study of the tree Allocasuarina huegeliana in Australian sandplain
   heath, simulated different fire return intervals with and without the
   additional management effort of mechanical removal of the native
   invader. Population behavior under the different management options was
   assessed, and general estimates of potential biodiversity impacts were
   compared. We found that changes in fire return intervals made no
   significant difference in the increase and spread of the population.
   However, decreased fire return intervals did lower densities reached in
   the simulated heath patch as well as the estimated maximum biodiversity
   impacts. When simulating both mechanical removal and fire, we found that
   the effects of removal depended on the return intervals and the strategy
   used. Increase rates were not significantly affected by any removal
   strategy. However, we found that removal, particularly over the whole
   patch rather than focusing on satellite populations, could decrease
   average and maximum densities reached and thus decrease the predicted
   biodiversity impacts. Our simulation model shows that disturbance-based
   management has the potential to control native invasion in cases where
   shifted disturbance is the likely driver of the invasion. The increased
   knowledge gained through the modeling methods outlined can inform
   management decisions in fire regime planning that takes into
   consideration control of an invasive species. Although particularly
   applicable to native invasives, when properly informed by empirical
   knowledge these techniques can be expanded to management of invasion by
   nonnative species, either by restoring historic disturbance regimes or
   by instating novel regimes in innovative ways.}},

   genomic pattern can often arise via different combinations of various
   processes such as selection, gene flow, recombination, mutation, genetic
   drift, and demographic variability. Thus, substantial challenges remain
   in elucidating which evolutionary processes generated observed genomic
   patterns. Nonetheless, the studies in this section demonstrate ways
   forward toward bridging pattern and process, including experimental
   work, genetic mapping, increased knowledge of natural history and
   demography, and comparative studies spanning taxa at different points in
   the speciation continuum. Such collective work will lead to more
   powerful hypothesis testing. Future work can also help better integrate
   the contributions of ecology, genome structure (e.g., inversions and
   translocations), and genetic conflict to genome evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal barrier environments are heavily influenced by human activities
   yet there are few examples of landscape ecological work investigating
   human dimensions of settlement disturbance patterns and processes. We
   investigated the impacts of residential development on vegetation cover
   for a remote roadless coastal barrier in Carova, North Carolina that is
   subject to policies from the federal to local levels and addressed three
   research questions: How has the region's the policy history influenced
   patterns of residential parcel development? What are the spatial and
   temporal patterns of parcel development? How has development impacted
   patterns of barrier vegetation cover? We traced the influences of the
   federal 1982 Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) designed to discourage
   development in risky coastal areas as well as state/local coastal
   policies and employed remote sensing change detection, NDVI analysis and
   spatial analysis and regression techniques. Results showed an
   acceleration of new housing structures since 1990, contrary to the
   intended effects of CBRA. An estimated vegetation cover loss of 437 m(2)
   was associated with each newly developed parcel. NDVI varied along
   spatial and temporal gradients with more recent development having lower
   NDVI than older development. Recently developed parcels were larger in
   area, closer to the beach, and contained houses with larger footprints
   compared to older developed parcels. Our approach represents a
   place-based analytical framework for coastal barrier landscapes. Beyond
   the Carova case study, adopting such an approach coupling natural and
   human systems for the entire eastern US barrier system requires defining
   a comprehensive set of coastal barrier spatial units to enable
   typological classification and subsequent systematic investigation to
   inform debates regarding coastal ecosystem services and sustainability.}},

   waterbird assemblages in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{25-34}},

Abstract = {{River regulation and water resource development have resulted in
   significant deterioration in aquatic ecosystems worldwide, including
   reductions in wetland extent, changed flow regimes, and declines in
   biodiversity. The impacts on the composition and distribution of
   waterbird assemblages has not been studied previously at the scale of a
   major river basin. We investigated the relationship between waterbird
   assemblage composition and ecosystem health across the 21 catchments of
   the Murray-Darling Basin in south-east Australia, which contains major
   wetlands that have been adversely affected by river regulation and
   over-allocation of water for irrigation. We allocated 51,000 surveys of
   96 waterbird species, obtained from the New Atlas of Australian Birds
   database, to 117 one-degree grid squares for multivariate statistical
   analysis (MVA). Hierarchical clustering showed five main groups of
   squares reflecting strong biogeographic gradients. Pronounced spatial
   autocorrelation in the waterbird assemblage data was found. Unequal
   survey effort across grid squares and varying taxonomic scope also
   hindered conventional MVA and interpretation. To circumvent these
   constraints, survey data were recompiled at the half-degree square
   resolution after removing surveys with few waterbird records, leaving
   17,448 surveys of 80 species. A novel sequential approach of
   multivariate regression of distance matrices, ordination of Bray-Curtis
   residuals, and post hoc correlation of the independent variable was used
   to test the hypothesis that assemblage composition varies systematically
   with Catchment Condition, after controlling for spatial autocorrelation,
   biogeographic trends and unequal survey effort. Ordination of the
   residuals of the half-degree square Bray Curtis association matrix
   revealed a strong relationship between a nine-point index of Catchment
   Condition and waterbird assemblage composition. The colonial nesting
   waterbird guild (egrets, herons, ibis and spoonbills), was uniquely
   identified as being aligned with catchments in moderate to good
   condition. Waterbird assemblage composition shows significant spatial
   variation throughout the Murray-Darling Basin, influenced by the
   hydrological and ecological condition of catchments as well as by
   natural biogeographic factors. The least degraded catchments offer the
   best habitat for the colonially nesting waterbird guild, the group most
   adversely affected historically by river regulation and water
   diversions. These catchments require protection from water resource
   development if such habitat is to be maintained. Our results support the
   conservation objective of improving wetland health in degraded
   catchments through delivering environmental flows to ensure breeding and
   population maintenance of colonial nesting waterbirds. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Abundance is an important population state variable for monitoring
   restoration progress. Efficient sampling often proves difficult,
   however, when populations are sparse and patchily distributed, such as
   early after restoration planting. Adaptive cluster sampling (ACS) can
   help by concentrating search effort in high density areas, improving the
   encounter rate and the ability to detect a population change over time.
   To illustrate the problem, I determined conventional design sample sizes
   for estimating abundance of 12 natural populations and 24 recently
   planted populations (divided among two preserves) of Lupinus perennis L.
   (wild blue lupine). I then determined the variance efficiency of ACS
   relative to simple random sampling at fixed effort and cost for 10
   additional planted populations in two habitats (field vs. shrubland).
   Conventional design sample sizes to estimate lupine stem density with
   10\% or 20\% margins of error were many times greater than initial
   sample size and would require sampling at least 90\% of the study area.
   Differences in effort requirements were negligible for the two preserves
   and natural versus planted populations. At fixed sample size, ACS
   equaled or outperformed simple random sampling in 40\% of populations;
   this shifted to 50\% after correcting for travel time among sample
   units. ACS appeared to be a better strategy for inter-seeded shrubland
   habitat than for planted field habitat. Restoration monitoring programs
   should consider adaptive sampling designs, especially when reliable
   abundance estimation under conventional designs proves elusive.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Numerous measures of human influence on the environment exist, but one
   that is of particular importance is houses as they can impact the
   environment from species through the landscape level. Furthermore,
   because the addition of houses represents an important component of
   landscape change, housing information could be used to assess ecological
   responses (e.g., decline in wildlife habitat) to that change. Recently
   developed housing density data represents a potential source of
   information to assess landscape and habitat change over long periods of
   time and at broad spatial extents, which is critically needed for
   conservation and management. Considering the potential value of housing
   data, our goal was to demonstrate how changes in the number of houses
   leads to changes in the amount of habitat across the landscape, and
   in-turn, how these habitat changes are likely to influence the
   distribution and abundance for a species of conservation concern, the
   Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus). Using a relationship between Ovenbird
   abundance and housing density, we predict suitable habitat in the
   forests of Massachusetts (USA) from 1970 to 2030. Over this 60-year
   period, the number of houses was projected to increase from 1.84 to 3.32
   million. This magnitude of housing growth translates into a 57 \%
   decline in Ovenbird habitat (6,002 km(2) to 2,616 km(2)), a minimum
   decline of similar to 850,000 (48 \%) Ovenbirds, and an increase in the
   number of subpopulations across the landscape. Overall, housing data
   provide important information to robustly measure landscape and habitat
   change, and hence predict population change of a species. We suggest
   that time series of housing data linked to ecological responses (e.g.,
   Ovenbird abundance) offers a novel and underutilized approach to
   estimating long-term and spatially broad predictions of ecosystem
   response to landscape change, which in turn can inform conservation and
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To assess the consequences of agricultural intensification since the
   1950s for Central Europe's plant communities of arable plants.
   Location Central Germany.
   Methods We employed a semipermanent plot design to analyse changes in
   392 field interiors for 10 study regions, including sandy, limestone and
   loamy sites between the 1950s/60s and 2009.
   Results The analysis revealed a reduction in the regional species pool
   during the 50-year period of 23\% (from 301 to 233 vascular species) and
   dramatic losses in plot-level diversity (from medians of 24 to 7).
   Median cover of spontaneously growing arable plants decreased from 30\%
   to 3\%. Losses were disproportionally larger on limestone sites while
   sandy sites maintained a larger fraction of the original diversity.
   Archaeophytes, neophytes and most Poaceae (including some aggressive
   weeds) showed similarly strong losses as indigenous plants. This
   contradicts the assumption that grasses and neophytes are generally
   profiting from agricultural intensification. Crop diversity decreased
   from 25 crop plants present in the 1950s/60s to only 16 in 2009, while
   crop cover generally increased. Winter cereals, oilseed rape and maize
   are dominant today, while all other crop types showed strong declines.
   Main conclusions Vegetation change over time depended on soil substrate
   with once markedly different arable communities now showing more
   homogenized community structure. Increasing Ellenberg indicator values
   for nitrogen and pH point to N fertilization as a major driver of
   change. New conservation measures such as the establishment of field
   flora reserves and agri-environment schemes with less intensive land use

   end to the decline of this functionally distinct and increasingly
   threatened component of the Central European flora.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{The emerging interest in sudden losses in vegetation and forest cover in
   semi-arid areas has led to a new understanding of the patterns and
   processes of deforestation. The Zagros oak forests in western Iran have
   undergone dramatic changes in cover and structure in recent decades,
   with negative consequences for the communities that depend upon them.
   This study had three objectives: (1) evaluate the nature and magnitude
   of these changes from 1972 to 2009 through trends in forest area and
   connectivity; (2) evaluate the changes in forest area and landscape
   connectivity across a climatic gradient; and (3) evaluate the effect of
   topographical variations. Landsat MSS, TM, and ETM+ images for the
   region were preprocessed and corrected prior to classification of 167
   landscape units (LU; 400 km(2) each). We developed two measures -
   deforestation sensitivity (DS) and connectivity sensitivity (CS) - for
   each LU. A considerable but relatively linear loss in forest area and
   connectivity was detected. Connectivity loss occurred more rapidly than
   forest loss due to the loss of connecting patches. More connectivity was
   lost in southern Zagros due to climatic differences and different forms
   of traditional land use. Steep slopes and high elevations experienced
   more forest loss and connectivity. In northern Zagros the coppice form
   of forest management should be supported as a method that maintains
   connectivity. In southern Zagros, restoration projects should focus on
   regeneration in forest gaps to restore connectivity between isolated
   forest fragments. The study provides large scale information for
   restoration projects across a spatial climatic gradient. (C) 2013

Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{1. The factors underlying population and community dynamics are almost
   invariably multivariate, and ecosystems worldwide are affected by many
   anthropogenic stressors. Inorganic dissolved nutrients and deposited
   fine sediment are common stressors in agricultural streams and can be
   expected to influence benthic algae and cyanobacteria.
   2. We determined population- and community-level responses of
   phototrophic periphyton along twin-stressor gradients of dissolved
   nutrients and deposited fine sediment after 20 days of exposure in
   stream mesocosms. Multiple linear regression and an
   information-theoretic approach were used to select the best predictive
   models for each response variable, accounting for potential
   subsidy-stress responses for each stressor (where at low stressor
   levels, an ecological variable responds positively up to an inflection
   point, beyond which the effect is negative) and for multiple-stressor
   interactions. This approach enabled us to test the subsidy-stress
   hypothesis for each stressor and to investigate whether the two
   stressors operated singly or in concert (additively or with an
   interaction) on periphyton attributes.
   3. Focussing further on three ecological guilds of periphyton (low
   profile, high profile, motile), we also tested the specific hypotheses,
   that sediment augmentation would produce a proportional increase in
   motile and a decrease in high-profile forms, and that nutrient
   augmentation would produce proportional increases in both motile and
   high-profile forms.
   4. Unimodal subsidy-stress patterns along the sediment gradient were
   found only for densities of two common Nitzschia species. By contrast,
   unimodal patterns along the nutrient gradient occurred frequently at
   both population and community levels, supporting the subsidy-stress
   hypothesis for nutrient enrichment. Some single-stressor responses were
   observed, but the twin stressors sediment and nutrients mainly acted in
   a simple, additive way, probably because their modes of action are
   different. As a notable exception from this rule, potentially harmful
   cyanobacteria (Phormidium and Oscillatoria species) responded
   synergistically to the stressors. Our hypothesis about the
   representation of ecological guilds across the sediment gradient was
   fully supported, whilst the hypothesis regarding nutrients received
   partial support.
   5. Categorisation of periphyton taxa into physiognomic guilds revealed
   predictable response patterns to the stressors. The prevalence of motile
   taxa in stream communities may be suitable for detecting sedimentation
   impacts and early signs of nutrient enrichment. Finally, based on
   periphyton response shapes along the nutrient gradient, thresholds could
   be identified at which community variables changed abruptly.}},

Abstract = {{Research toward the impacts of climate change and human activities on
   marine ecosystems is challenged by the limitations of present-day
   ecosystem models to address the interrelated spatial dynamics between
   climate, ocean chemistry, marine food webs, and human systems. The work
   presented here, the spatial temporal data framework, is part of a larger
   study, the NF-UBC Nereus Program, to develop a new approach to model
   interoperability for closing the gap between marine ecosystem modeling
   tools via geographic information systems (GIS) technology. The approach
   we present simplifies interdisciplinary model interoperability by
   separating technical and scientific challenges into a flexible and
   modular software approach. To illustrate capabilities of the new
   framework, we use a remote-sensing derived spatial and temporal time
   series to drive the primary production dynamics in an existing food web
   model of the North-Central Adriatic using the Ecospace module of the
   Ecopath with Ecosim approach. In general, the predictive capabilities of
   the food web model to hind-cast ecosystem dynamics are enhanced when
   applying the new framework by better reflecting observed species
   population trends and distributions. Results show that changes at the
   phytoplankton level due to changes in primary production are
   realistically reproduced and cascade up the pelagic food web. The
   dynamics of zooplankton and small and large pelagic fish are impacted.
   Highly exploited demersal species such as European hake do, however, not
   show clear signs of cascading. This may be due to the high fishing
   pressure on this species and the resulting strong historical decline in
   the area. In general, the development of the new framework offers
   ecosystem modelers with unprecedented capabilities to include spatial
   temporal time series into food web analysis with a minimal set of
   required steps. It is a promising step toward integrating species
   distribution models and food web dynamics, and future implementations of

Abstract = {{The importance of waterlogging in saltmarshes, and especially its role

   physiological/chorological approach was taken to investigate this in a
   New Zealand salt meadow. The effect of waterlogging on the activities of
   enzymes associated with anaerobic metabolism, especially alcohol

   five representative salt meadow species: Puccinellia stricta, Isolepis
   cemua, Samolus repens, Selliera radicans and Triglochin striata. All
   species showed a significant increase in ADH activity in either shoots
   or roots in response to waterlogging. In P. stricta, sucrose synthase
   and four out of the five enzymes involved in fermentation increased
   under waterlogging. However, the photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) of
   the species did not change under this regime. The species composition
   gradient on the saltmarsh was related primarily to elevation, a proxy
   for water inundation, and the distribution of species along that
   gradient was related to their tolerance of waterlogging as measured by
   stimulation of ADH activity. However, the species-composition gradient
   was also related to water-ponding depressions, demonstrating the role of
   microtopography, with depression mimicking higher elevations, probably
   due to rainwater ponding. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are an important conservation tool. For
   marine predators, recent research has focused on the use of Species
   Distribution Models (SDMs) to identify proposed sites. We used a maximum
   entropy modelling approach based on static and dynamic oceanographic
   parameters to determine optimal feeding habitat for black-legged
   kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) at two colonies during two consecutive
   breeding seasons (2009 and 2010). A combination of Geographic
   Positioning System (GPS) loggers and Time-Depth Recorders (TDRs)
   attributed feeding activity to specific locations. Feeding areas were
   <30 km from the colony, <40 km from land, in productive waters, 25-175 m
   deep. The predicted extent of optimal habitat declined at both colonies
   between 2009 and 2010 coincident with declines in reproductive success.
   Whilst the area of predicted optimal habitat changed, its location was
   spatially stable between years. There was a close match between observed
   feeding locations and habitat predicted as optimal at one colony (Lambay
   Island, Republic of Ireland), but a notable mismatch at the other
   (Rathlin Island, Northern Ireland). Designation of an MPA at Rathlin
   may, therefore, be less effective than a similar designation at Lambay
   perhaps due to the inherent variability in currents and sea state in the
   North Channel compared to the comparatively stable conditions in the
   central Irish Sea. Current strategies for designating MPAs do not
   accommodate likely future redistribution of resources due to climate
   change. We advocate the development of new approaches including dynamic
   MPAs that track changes in optimal habitat and non-colony specific

Abstract = {{This study quantifies for the first time the influence of flow
   regulation on the river thermal behaviour of an ungauged basin located
   in central-eastern Argentina. A 30-day data set of continuous summer
   hourly data was assembled for eight water temperature gauging sites
   deployed along the main channel upstream and downstream from the
   impoundment. Analysis methods include descriptive statistics of daily
   temperature data, classification of diurnal regimes by relative
   differences in the `shape' and the `magnitude' of the thermographs
   (RSMC), and quantification of the climatic sensitivity of water
   temperature regimes using a sensitivity index. Results revealed that
   temporal fluctuations in water temperatures were linked to
   meteorological drivers; however, spatial variability in the shape and
   the magnitude of the thermographs revealed the effects of the dam in
   regulating river thermal behaviour downstream. Water temperatures
   immediately below the dam were reduced notably; diurnal cycles were
   reduced in magnitude, delayed in timing, and revealed overall climatic
   insensitivity and high temporal stability in regime shape. Dam effects
   persisted along the 15-km stretch monitored, although declined in the
   downstream direction. These findings provide new scientific
   understanding about the river water quality and inform river management
   about potential shifts in summer water temperature with great
   implications for the diversity and lifecycles of Neotropical river
   fauna. The use of the RSMC and sensitivity index approaches in water
   temperature assessment is novel and has wider applicability for
   quantifying river thermal regimes and their sensitivity to drivers of
   change over a range of temporal and spatial scales. Copyright (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Riparian ecosystems are required to be preserved to achieve a good
   ecological status. The Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC)
   specifically supports the assessment of new management tools that allow
   the European Member States to achieve good ecological status of
   river-related ecosystems. Within several approaches, a dynamic riparian
   vegetation distributed model (CASiMiR-vegetation), with a time step of 1
   year, has been selected as a useful first-step tool to achieve the Water
   Framework Directive requirements. The model has been implemented into
   three river reaches with different climatic and hydrologic settings,
   located in three European countries. Common bases were established in
   the model setup. The model was calibrated independently in the Kleblach
   reach (Drau River, Austria), the Ribeira reach (Odelouca River,
   Portugal), and the Terde reach (Mijares River, Spain) with simulation
   periods of 8, 11 and 41 years, respectively. The parameter values and
   the results were comparable between the different countries. The
   calibration performance achieved high correctly classified instances
   (60\%). Additionally, weighted kappa values ranged from 0.52 to 0.66 in
   distinguishing riparian succession phases. The model behaved similarly
   in the validation, even offering better results in most cases. This work
   demonstrates the applicability of this model in the simulation of the
   riparian vegetation dynamic distribution over a wide range of
   environments. As it performs in a robust manner and with good results in
   reaches with different hydrological characteristics, the model could be
   also applied to analyse different hydrological scenarios or to predict
   changes after restoration measures within a reach. Copyright (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The expansion of roads, and the subsequent changes to the surrounding
   landscape not only lead to landscape fragmentation but also have been
   shown to be a key driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation.
   Local declines of species abundance as well as changes in animal
   behaviour have drawn attention to wider ecosystem effects including
   altered species composition and a degradation of ecosystem functioning.
   However, methods for measuring and quantifying the distribution and
   environmental impacts of roads are not yet fully developed. We present a
   new technique for assessing the potential impacts of roads on
   biodiversity using a spatial road disturbance index (SPROADI). The index
   is calculated from three sub-indices: traffic intensity as a measure of
   traffic volume per time and space; vicinity impact, which is the
   assessment of edge effect of roads on adjacent habitats (the road-effect
   zone); and fragmentation grade, which provides an indication of the
   degree to which the landscape is intersected by roads. SPROADI was then
   tested using data from the Federal State of Brandenburg in north-eastern
   Germany. A sensitivity analysis was carried out on the results to assess
   the robustness of the index. The findings revealed expected patterns of
   high road disturbance in urban and peri-urban landscapes surrounding
   Berlin. Less obvious were the high levels of road density and impacts in
   forest plantations across the southern region of Brandenburg, and low
   levels of road disturbance in agricultural crop lands of the
   north-western region. Results were variable for areas under some form of
   protection. The only national park displayed substantially lower SPROADI
   values in contrast to the surrounding non-protected areas whilst other
   protected area categories, which were landscape conservation areas and
   nature parks, revealed SPROADI values that were equally high as those
   for non-protected areas. The results of this study demonstrate the
   strengths and potential applications of SPROADI as a quantitative means
   for identifying low-traffic areas in the context of conservation and
   sustainable transport planning.}},

Abstract = {{The realization that complex systems such as ecological communities can
   collapse or shift regimes suddenly and without rapid external forcing
   poses a serious challenge to our understanding and management of the
   natural world. The potential to identify early warning signals that
   would allow researchers and managers to predict such events before they
   happen has therefore been an invaluable discovery that offers a way
   forward in spite of such seemingly unpredictable behavior. Research into
   early warning signals has demonstrated that it is possible to define and
   detect such early warning signals in advance of a transition in certain
   contexts. Here, we describe the pattern emerging as research continues
   to explore just how far we can generalize these results. A core of
   examples emerges that shares three properties: the phenomenon of rapid
   regime shifts, a pattern of ``critical slowing down{''} that can be used
   to detect the approaching shift, and a mechanism of bifurcation driving
   the sudden change. As research has expanded beyond these core examples,
   it is becoming clear that not all systems that show regime shifts
   exhibit critical slowing down, or vice versa. Even when systems exhibit
   critical slowing down, statistical detection is a challenge. We review
   the literature that explores these edge cases and highlight the need for
   (a) new early warning behaviors that can be used in cases where rapid
   shifts do not exhibit critical slowing down; (b) the development of
   methods to identify which behavior might be an appropriate signal when
   encountering a novel system, bearing in mind that a positive indication
   for some systems is a negative indication in others; and (c) statistical
   methods that can distinguish between signatures of early warning
   behaviors and noise.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystems sometimes shift between different states or dynamic regimes.
   Theory attributes these shifts to multiple ecosystem attractors.
   However, documenting multiple ecosystem attractors is difficult,

   causing trophic cascades and shifting the food web from a

   We evaluated evidence that the shifts in the fish community comprise
   alternate attractors using two complementary approaches. First, we
   calculated phase space trajectories to visualize the shift between
   attractors. Second, we computed generalized autoregressive conditional
   heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models and the Brock-Dechert-Scheinkman (BDS)
   test for linearity. The reconstructed phase space trajectories show the
   system departing a point attractor, entering a limit cycle, and then
   shifting to a new point attractor. The GARCH and BDS results indicate

Abstract = {{1. Concomitant with the rise in the proportion of the global human
   population that resides in urban areas has been growth in awareness of
   the importance of the provision of ecosystem goods and services to those
   people. Urban areas are themselves of significance in this regard
   because of their areal extent, and hence the quantity of services
   falling within their bounds, and because of the need for local provision
   of services to urban residents. 2. Here, we review key challenges to the
   effective management of ecosystem goods and services within urban areas.
   3. These challenges include the structure of green space, its temporal
   dynamics, spatial constraint on ecosystem service flows, occurrence of
   novel forms of flows, large numbers of land managers, conflicting
   management goals, possible differences between perceptions of urban
   dwellers and the reality of the distribution and flow of ecosystem
   services, and the wicked' nature of the problem of ecosystem service
   management. 4. Synthesis and applications. Urban areas present very
   particular combinations of challenges and opportunities for the
   management of ecosystem goods and services. The spatial and temporal
   heterogeneity of green spaces greatly complicates the maintenance and
   improvement in service provision as well as dramatically inflating
   costs. Spatial constraints on ecosystem service flows mean that these
   can be highly dependent on the maintenance of particular areas of
   connectivity, but also that provision of additional key points of
   connectivity may be disproportionately beneficial to those flows. The
   existence of novel forms of flows of ecosystem services in urban areas
   offers means of overcoming spatial constraints on more natural flows,
   but will require the development of new kinds of ecosystem process
   models to inform their design and management. The large numbers of land
   managers, conflicts between the best approaches for managing for
   different goods and services, and frequent differences between the
   perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of urban landscapes create
   a complex management context. The management of ecosystem goods and
   services is closely allied to the challenges of conventional urban
   planning. However, applied ecology has a broad range of tools available
   to assist in determining solutions, including the use of high-resolution
   remote sensing techniques, landscape ecology principles and theory (e.g.
   patch and matrix frameworks, meta-population models), and systematic
   conservation planning approaches.}},

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{1. The health of managed and wild honeybee colonies appears to have
   declined substantially in Europe and the United States over the last
   decade. Sustainability of honeybee colonies is important not only for
   honey production, but also for pollination of crops and wild plants
   alongside other insect pollinators. A combination of causal factors,
   including parasites, pathogens, land use changes and pesticide usage,
   are cited as responsible for the increased colony mortality. 2. However,
   despite detailed knowledge of the behaviour of honeybees and their
   colonies, there are no suitable tools to explore the resilience
   mechanisms of this complex system under stress. Empirically testing all
   combinations of stressors in a systematic fashion is not feasible. We
   therefore suggest a cross-level systems approach, based on mechanistic
   modelling, to investigate the impacts of (and interactions between)
   colony and land management. 3. We review existing honeybee models that
   are relevant to examining the effects of different stressors on colony
   growth and survival. Most of these models describe honeybee colony
   dynamics, foraging behaviour or honeybee - varroa mite - virus
   interactions. 4. We found that many, but not all, processes within
   honeybee colonies, epidemiology and foraging are well understood and
   described in the models, but there is no model that couples in-hive
   dynamics and pathology with foraging dynamics in realistic landscapes.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We describe how a new integrated model
   could be built to simulate multifactorial impacts on the honeybee colony
   system, using building blocks from the reviewed models. The development
   of such a tool would not only highlight empirical research priorities
   but also provide an important forecasting tool for policy makers and
   beekeepers, and we list examples of relevant applications to bee disease
   and landscape management decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The intermittent upwelling hypothesis (IUH) predicts that the strength
   of ecological subsidies, organismal growth responses, and species
   interactions will vary unimodally along a gradient of upwelling from
   persistent downwelling to persistent upwelling, with maximal levels at
   an intermediate or intermittent state of upwelling. To test this model,
   we employed the comparative-experimental method to investigate these
   processes at 16-44 wave-exposed rocky intertidal sites in Oregon,
   California, and New Zealand, varying in average upwelling and/or
   downwelling during spring-summer. As predicted by the IUH, ecological
   subsidies (phytoplankton abundance, prey recruitment rates), prey
   responses (barnacle colonization, mussel growth), and species
   interactions (competition rate, predation rate and effects) were
   unimodally related to upwelling. On average, unimodal relationships with
   upwelling magnitude explained approximate to 50\% of the variance in the
   various processes, and unimodal and monotonic positive relationships
   against an index of intermittency explained approximate to 37\% of the
   variance. Regressions among the ecological subsidies and species
   interactions were used to infer potential ecological linkages that
   underpinned these patterns. Abundance of phytoplankton was associated
   with increases in rates of barnacle colonization, intensity of
   competition and predation, and predation effects, and rates of barnacle
   recruitment were associated with increases in mussel growth, barnacle
   colonization, and species interactions. Positive effects on interactions
   were also seen for rates of colonization, competition, predation, and
   predation effects. Several responses were saturating or exponential,
   suggestive of threshold effects. These results suggest that the IUH has
   geographic generality and are also consistent with earlier arguments
   that bottom-up effects and propagule subsidies are strongly linked to
   the dynamics of higher trophic levels, or top-down effects, as well as
   to nontrophic interactions. The approximate to 50\% of the variance not
   explained by upwelling is likely due to more regional-to-local
   influences on the processes examined, and future efforts should focus on
   incorporating such effects into the IUH.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly all ecosystems have been altered by human activities, and most
   communities are now composed of interacting species that have not
   co-evolved. These changes may modify species interactions, energy and
   material flows, and food-web stability. Although structural changes to
   ecosystems have been widely reported, few studies have linked such
   changes to dynamic food-web attributes and patterns of energy flow.
   Moreover, there have been few tests of food-web stability theory in
   highly disturbed and intensely managed freshwater ecosystems. Such
   synthetic approaches are needed for predicting the future trajectory of
   ecosystems, including how they may respond to natural or anthropogenic
   perturbations. We constructed flow food webs at six locations along a
   386-km segment of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon (Arizona, USA) for
   three years. We characterized food-web structure and production, trophic
   basis of production, energy efficiencies, and interaction-strength
   distributions across a spatial gradient of perturbation (i.e., distance
   from Glen Canyon Dam), as well as before and after an experimental
   flood. We found strong longitudinal patterns in food-web characteristics
   that strongly correlated with the spatial position of large tributaries.
   Above tributaries, food webs were dominated by nonnative New Zealand
   mudsnails (62\% of production) and nonnative rainbow trout (100\% of
   fish production). The simple structure of these food webs led to few
   dominant energy pathways (diatoms to few invertebrate taxa to rainbow
   trout), large energy inefficiencies (i.e., <20\% of invertebrate
   production consumed by fishes), and right-skewed interaction-strength
   distributions, consistent with theoretical instability. Below large
   tributaries, invertebrate production declined approximate to 18-fold,
   while fish production remained similar to upstream sites and comprised
   predominately native taxa (80-100\% of production). Sites below large
   tributaries had increasingly reticulate and detritus-based food webs
   with a higher prevalence of omnivory, as well as interaction strength
   distributions more typical of theoretically stable food webs (i.e.,
   nearly twofold higher proportion of weak interactions). Consistent with
   theory, downstream food webs were less responsive to the experimental
   flood than sites closest to the dam. We show how human-induced shifts to
   food-web structure can affect energy flow and interaction strengths, and
   we show that these changes have consequences for food-web function and
   response to perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{Aim We investigate first whether fire regimes resulting from the
   combination of climate change and fire-fighting policy may affect
   species distributions in Mediterranean landscapes, and second to what
   extent distributional dynamics may be constrained by the spatial legacy
   of historical land use.
   Location Catalonia (north-eastern Spain).
   Methods We modelled the distributional responses of 64 forest and
   open-habitat bird species to nine fire-regime scenarios, defined by
   combining different levels of climate change and fire suppression
   efficiency. A fire-succession model was used to stochastically simulate
   land-cover changes between 2000 and 2050 under these scenarios. We used
   species distribution models to predict habitat suitability and occupancy
   dynamics under either no dispersal or full dispersal assumptions.
   Results Under many simulated scenarios, the succession from shrubland to
   forest dominated over the creation of new low-vegetation areas derived
   from wildfires. Consequently, open-habitat specialists were the group
   most affected by losses of suitable habitat. Fire regimes obtained under
   scenarios including high fire suppression efficiency resulted in a
   larger number of bird species experiencing reductions in their
   distribution area.
   Main conclusions Anthropogenic factors, such as historical land-use
   change and fire suppression, can drive regional distribution dynamics in
   directions opposite to those expected from climatic trends. This raises
   the question of what drivers and interactions should be given priority
   in the prediction of biodiversity responses to global change at the

Abstract = {{Aim The increased incidence of large fires around much of the world in
   recent decades raises questions about human and non-human drivers of
   fire and the likelihood of increased fire activity in the future. The
   purpose of this paper is to outline a conceptual framework for examining
   where human-set fires and feedbacks are likely to be most pronounced in
   temperate forests world-wide and to establish and test a methodology for
   evaluating this framework using palaeoecological records.
   Location Tasmania, north-western USA, southern South America and New
   Zealand.
   Methods We outline a conceptual framework for predicting the sensitivity
   of ecosystems to human impacts on fire regimes and then use a
   circum-Pacific comparison of existing historical reconstructions of
   fire, climate, human settlement and vegetation to evaluate this
   approach.
   Results Previous research investigating important controls on fire
   activity shows that the sensitivity of temperate ecosystems to human-set
   fires is modulated by the frequency of natural fire occurrence, fuel
   moisture and fuel type and availability. Palaeoecological data from four
   temperate regions suggest that the effects of anthropogenic burning are
   greatest where fire is naturally rare, vegetation is poorly adapted to
   fire and fuel biomass is abundant and contiguous. Alternatively, where
   fire activity is naturally high and vegetation is well adapted to fire,
   evidence of human influence on fire and vegetation is less obvious.
   Main conclusions Palaeofire records suggest that the most dynamic and
   persistent ecosystem transitions occur where human activities increase
   landscape flammability through fire-vegetation feedbacks. Rapid forest
   transitions in biomassrich ecosystems such as New Zealand and areas of
   Tasmania and southern South America illustrate how landscapes
   experiencing few fires can shift past tipping points to become
   fire-prone landscapes with new alternative stable state communities.
   Comparisons of palaeoecological data from different regions with similar
   biophysical gradients but different human settlement histories can
   provide new opportunities for understanding ecosystem vulnerability to
   fire-climate-human interactions.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach to improve the accuracy and to reduce the uncertainty
   associated with the assessment of ecotoxicological risks and the
   determination of remedial objectives was developed herein for a scenario
   involving multiple contaminants in soil. This approach used
   laboratory-derived site-specific toxicological data (i.e., obtained from
   toxicity testing using species in direct contact with soil such as
   plants and invertebrates) instead of the more traditional approach using
   generic toxicological benchmarks for corresponding groups of organisms.
   Inherent to this approach were the data exploration and reduction; the
   use of generalized linear models to integrate the data for stressors
   (site-specific chemical and edaphic characteristics with the potential
   for influencing toxicity) and effects (biological responses for multiple
   species and multiple endpoints); and the derivation of tools that could
   predict the level of impairment associated with any combination of
   metals' concentrations measured on site and compare it to a
   pre-specified acceptable threshold. A case study is presented whereby
   this method was applied to a large site contaminated with a mixture of

   monitoring}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{675-683}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Autonomous acoustic recorders are widely available and can provide a
   highly efficient method of species monitoring, especially when coupled
   with software to automate data processing. However, the adoption of
   these techniques is restricted by a lack of direct comparisons with
   existing manual field surveys.
   2. We assessed the performance of autonomous methods by comparing manual
   and automated examination of acoustic recordings with a field-listening
   survey, using commercially available autonomous recorders and custom
   call detection and classification software. We compared the detection
   capability, time requirements, areal coverage and weather condition bias
   of these three methods using an established call monitoring programme
   for a nocturnal bird, the little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii).
   3. The autonomous recorder methods had very high precision (>98\%) and
   required <3\% of the time needed for the field survey. They were less
   sensitive, with visual spectrogram inspection recovering 80\% of the
   total calls detected and automated call detection 40\%, although this
   recall increased with signal strength. The areal coverage of the
   spectrogram inspection and automatic detection methods were 85\% and
   42\% of the field survey. The methods using autonomous recorders were
   more adversely affected by wind and did not show a positive association
   between ground moisture and call rates that was apparent from the field
   counts. However, all methods produced the same results for the most
   important conservation information from the survey: the annual change in
   calling activity.
   4. Autonomous monitoring techniques incur different biases to manual
   surveys and so can yield different ecological conclusions if sampling is
   not adjusted accordingly. Nevertheless, the sensitivity, robustness and
   high accuracy of automated acoustic methods demonstrate that they offer
   a suitable and extremely efficient alternative to field observer point
   counts for species monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Stage structures of populations can have a profound influence on their
   dynamics. However, not much is known about the transient dynamics that
   follow a disturbance in such systems. Here we combined chemostat
   experiments with dynamical modeling to study the response of the
   phytoplankton species Chlorella vulgaris to press perturbations. From an
   initially stable steady state, we altered either the concentration or
   dilution rate of a growth-limiting resource. This disturbance induced a
   complex transient response-characterized by the possible onset of
   oscillations-before population numbers relaxed to a new steady state.
   Thus, cell numbers could initially change in the opposite direction of
   the long-term change. We present quantitative indexes to characterize
   the transients and to show that the dynamic response is dependent on the
   degree of synchronization among life stages, which itself depends on the
   state of the population before perturbation. That is, we show how
   identical future steady states can be approached via different
   transients depending on the initial population structure. Our
   experimental results are supported by a size-structured model that
   accounts for interplay between cell-cycle and population-level processes
   and that includes resource-dependent variability in cell size. Our
   results should be relevant to other populations with a stage structure
   including organisms of higher order.}},

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Traditional upland livestock grazing is declining worldwide, leading to
   concerns about possible impacts on biodiversity. Although monitoring of
   protected areas often focuses on rare species, management changes also
   affect currently common species and vegetation structure.
   ``Biodiversity{''} is a concept rather than a simple variable, and
   monitoring it requires indicators that are widely applicable and
   appropriate to context. This paper presents a novel knowledge-driven
   approach to developing a selection of biodiversity indicators that can
   then be rapidly and objectively measured within rangeland environments.
   Stakeholder and professional opinion on likely changes in biodiversity
   following reductions in sheep grazing was elicited using a
   workshop-based process. Potential variables suitable for use as
   biodiversity indicators were developed and professional opinion on their
   usefulness sought. A number of indicators were then tested in a natural
   experiment field study on the impact of reduced sheep grazing in
   Scotland. In the field study, red deer abundance appeared to increase
   where sheep grazing was reduced. It was therefore necessary to use
   estimates of both sheep and deer abundance as explanatory variables. In
   agreement with the professionals' predictions, dwarf shrub abundance and
   vegetation height were greater where sheep grazing had been reduced,
   after taking into account differences in deer. In contrast to the
   professionals' predictions, the field results showed rough grasses and
   dead material were less abundant where sheep had been reduced, with deer
   also having an impact on dead material. The professionals were unsure of
   the effects of reduced sheep grazing on vegetation mosaic structure; the
   field results suggested that reduced sheep grazing leads to a reduction
   in structural heterogeneity, but that deer had the greater impact in
   this case. Several other predictions showed nonsignificant differences
   in relation to reduced sheep grazing. The participatory method and some
   of the field methods presented are cost effective and widely applicable.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental variability can destabilize communities by causing
   correlated interspecific fluctuations that weaken the portfolio effect,
   yet evidence of such a mechanism is rare in natural systems. Here, we
   ask whether the population dynamics of similar sympatric species of a
   seabird breeding community are synchronized, and if these species have
   similar exceptional responses to environmental variation. We used a
   24-year time series of the breeding success and population growth rate
   of a marine top predator species group to assess the degree of synchrony
   between species demography. We then developed a novel method to examine
   the species group - all species combined - response to environmental
   variability, in particular, whether multiple species experience similar,
   pronounced fluctuations in their demography. Multiple species were
   positively correlated in breeding success and growth rate. Evidence of
   exceptional years was found, where the species group experienced
   pronounced fluctuations in their demography. The synchronous response of
   the species group was negatively correlated with winter sea surface
   temperature of the preceding year for both growth rate and breeding
   success. We present evidence for synchronous, exceptional responses of a
   species group that are driven by environmental variation. Such species
   covariation destabilizes communities by reducing the portfolio effect,
   and such exceptional responses may increase the risk of a state change
   in this community. Our understanding of the future responses to
   environmental change requires an increased focus on the short-term
   fluctuations in demography that are driven by extreme environmental
   variability.}},

Abstract = {{An increasingly important practical application of the analysis of
   spatial genetic structure within plant species is to help define the
   extent of local provenance seed collection zones that minimize negative
   impacts in ecological restoration programs. Here, we derive seed
   sourcing guidelines from a novel range-wide assessment of spatial
   genetic structure of 24 populations of Banksia menziesii (Proteaceae), a
   widely distributed Western Australian tree of significance in local
   ecological restoration programs. An analysis of molecular variance
   (AMOVA) of 100 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers
   revealed significant genetic differentiation among populations (Phi(PT)
   = 0.18). Pairwise population genetic dissimilarity was correlated with
   geographic distance, but not environmental distance derived from 15
   climate variables, suggesting overall neutrality of these markers with
   regard to these climate variables. Nevertheless, Bayesian outlier
   analysis identified four markers potentially under selection, although
   these were not correlated with the climate variables. We calculated a
   global R-statistic using analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) to test the
   statistical significance of population differentiation and to infer a
   threshold seed collection zone distance of similar to 60 km (all
   markers) and 100 km (outlier markers) when genetic distance was
   regressed against geographic distance. Population pairs separated by >60
   km were, on average, twice as likely to be significantly genetically
   differentiated than population pairs separated by <60 km, suggesting
   that habitat-matched sites within a 30-km radius around a restoration
   site genetically defines a local provenance seed collection zone for B.
   menziesii. Our approach is a novel probability-based practical solution
   for the delineation of a local seed collection zone to minimize negative
   genetic impacts in ecological restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Tracking trends in the abundance of wildlife populations is a sensitive
   method for assessing biodiversity change due to the short time-lag
   between human pressures and corresponding shifts in population trends.
   This study tests for proposed associations between different types of
   human pressures and wildlife population abundance decline-curves and
   introduces a method to distinguish decline trajectories from natural
   fluctuations in population time-series. First, we simulated typical
   mammalian population time-series under different human pressure types
   and intensities and identified significant distinctions in population
   dynamics. Based on the concavity of the smoothed population trend and
   the algebraic function which was the closest fit to the data, we
   determined those differences in decline dynamics that were consistently
   attributable to each pressure type. We examined the robustness of the
   attribution of pressure type to population decline dynamics under more
   realistic conditions by simulating populations under different levels of
   environmental stochasticity and time-series data quality. Finally, we
   applied our newly developed method to 124 wildlife population
   time-series and investigated how those threat types diagnosed by our
   method compare to the specific threatening processes reported for those
   populations. We show how wildlife population decline curves can be used
   to discern between broad categories of pressure or threat types, but do
   not work for detailed threat attributions. More usefully, we find that
   differences in population decline curves can reliably identify
   populations where pressure is increasing over time, even when data
   quality is poor, and propose this method as a cost-effective technique
   for prioritizing conservation actions between populations.}},

Abstract = {{It is very common that only presence data are available in ecological
   niche modeling. However, most existing methods for evaluating the
   accuracy of presence-absence (binary) predictions of species require
   presence-absence data. The aim of this study is to present a new method
   for accuracy assessment that does not rely on absence data. Two new
   statistics Fpb and Fcpb were derived based on presence-background data.
   With generated six virtual species, we used DOMAIN, generalized linear
   modeling (GLM), and maximum entropy (MAXENT) to produce different
   species presence-absence predictions. To investigate the effectiveness
   of the new statistics in accuracy assessment, we used Fpb, Fcpb, the
   traditional F-measure (F), kappa coefficient, true skill statistic
   (TSS), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and
   the contrast validation index (CVI) to evaluate the accuracy of
   predictions, and the behaviors of these accuracy measures were compared.
   The effectiveness of Fpb for threshold selection and estimation of
   species prevalence was also investigated. Experimental results show that
   Fcpb is an estimate of F. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (COR)
   between Fcpb and F is 0.9882, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of
   0.0171. In general, Fpb, Fcpb, F, kappa coefficient, TSS, and CVI can
   sort models by the accuracy of binary prediction, but AUC is not
   appropriate to evaluate the accuracy of binary prediction. For DOMAIN,
   GLM, and MAXENT, finding the threshold by maximizing Fpb and by
   maximizing F result in similar accuracies. In addition, the estimation
   of species prevalence based on binary output with maximizing Fpb as the
   thresholding method is significantly more accurate than simply averaging
   the original continuous output. The best estimate of prevalence is
   provided by the binary output of MAXENT, with an RMSE of 0.0116.
   Finally, we conclude that the new method is promising in accuracy
   assessment, threshold selection, and estimation of species prevalence,
   all of which are important but challenging problems with presence-only
   data. Because it does not require absence data, the new method will have
   important applications in ecological niche modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Management of natural resources, particularly water, increasingly
   requires that likely benefits of particular actions (e.g., allocating an
   environmental flow) are quantified in advance. Therefore, new techniques
   are required that enable those potential benefits to be objectively
   compared among competing options for management (e.g., compared to a do
   nothing scenario). Scenario modeling is one method for developing such
   an objective comparison. We used existing hydrologic, hydrodynamic, and
   ecosystem response models for a case study location, the Coorong, an
   inverse estuary in South Australia, to illustrate the potential for such
   scenario modeling to inform natural resource management. We modeled a
   set of 12 scenarios that included different levels of water extraction,
   potential future climate change, and sea-level change, thereby enabling
   a comparison of the different drivers of possible future reductions in
   water availability in the Coorong. We discovered that potential future
   climate change combined with current extraction levels has the capacity
   to devastate the ecology of the Coorong, but also that much of the
   degradation could be averted by reducing upstream extractions of water.
   The inclusion of possible sea-level change had a surprising effect,
   whereby higher sea levels increased hydrodynamic connectivity between
   the Coorong's two lagoons. Increased hydrodynamic connectivity limited
   the occurrence of extremely low water levels and high salinities due to
   evapoconcentration that were simulated for dry future climates in the
   absence of sea-level rise. These findings strongly suggest that future
   ecological degradation in the Coorong is not a foregone conclusion, and
   that management decisions regarding water allocations upstream will
   determine the ecological future of this coastal lagoon.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Urbanization as a major global trend profoundly changes biodiversity
   patterns, and homogenization of urban biota due to expanding exotic
   species and declining native species is of increasing concern. Previous
   studies on this topic have mostly taken place at large scales that
   include high habitat heterogeneity. Here, we aimed at disentangling the
   effects of urbanization and plant invasion on species composition
   through the analysis of similarity patterns of urban plant assemblages
   at the community scale where species interact. Location Berlin, Germany.
   Methods We analysed how different levels of urbanization, specific
   components of the urban matrix and the dominance of a native (Betula
   pendula) versus an exotic tree species (Robinia pseudoacacia) affect
   alpha and beta diversity of urban woodland understorey vegetation in
   sixty-eight 100-m2 plots. Results Exotic dominance reduced alpha
   diversity, but not beta diversity of the total species pool. Comparing
   beta diversity among different species groups revealed significant but
   divergent effects of exotic dominance, habitat connectivity and levels
   of urbanization in native and non-native species assemblages. In
   particular, urbanity proved to homogenize the native species pool,
   whereas the beta diversity of the non-native species pool showed a more
   pronounced response to exotic dominance. Main conclusions Our data
   provide evidence that both the urban context and the dominance of exotic
   species can modify homogenization processes at the community level.
   These novel insights into the mechanisms of biotic homogenization of

   account for heterogeneous detectability (p<1) has been difficult to
   implement. We provide an application of current methods of occupancy
   estimation and modelling to account for imperfect detection in the
   analysis of atlas data. Location New York, USA. Methods We employed
   multiseason occupancy models substituting spatial replicates for
   temporally repeated surveys to examine changes in distribution of the
   Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis) using breeding bird atlases from
   1980-1985 and 2000-2005. We compared estimates from models accounting
   for p<1 versus those assuming p=1 in assessing statewide patterns of
   occupancy, colonization and extinction. Results We found forest cover,
   observer effort, information on previous detections and the sampling
   year were important predictors of detection. Environmental predictors of
   statewide occupancy dynamics were similar among models accounting for
   p<1 versus those assuming p=1. Despite these similarities, site-level
   estimates of occupancy from the model accounting for imperfect detection
   indicated 14\% and 19\% higher site occupancy in the 1980-1985 and
   2000-2005 Atlases, respectively. In addition, relative to the model
   accounting for p<1, the model assuming perfect detectability
   underestimated persistence and overestimated extinction between atlases.
   The model accounting for p<1 had 0.3\% and 7.9\% higher accuracy in
   predicting occupancy in the 1980-1985 and 2000-2005 Atlases,
   respectively, than the models assuming p=1. Main conclusions Occupancy
   modelling and estimation can be successfully applied to broad-scale
   surveys, such as atlases, that do not explicitly implement repeated
   visits to a survey block. Occupancy modelling allows for a more rigorous
   analysis of atlas data for exploring species-environmental relationships
   and modelling species distributions while accounting for imperfect
   detection.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A consistent methodology enabling the estimation of the economic losses
   associated with drought and the comparison of estimates between sites
   and across time has been elusive. In this paper, we develop an ecosystem
   service approach to fill this research gap. We apply this approach to
   analysis of the Millennium Drought in the South Australian portion of
   the Murray-Darling Basin which provided a natural experiment for the
   economic estimation of hydrological ecosystem service losses.
   cataloguing estimates of expenditures incurred by Commonwealth and state
   governments, communities and individuals, we find that nearly \$810
   million was spent during the drought to mitigate losses, replace
   ecosystem services and adapt to new ecosystem equilibria. The approach
   developed here is transferable to other drought prone regions, providing
   insights into the potentially unexpected consequences of drought and
   ecosystem thresholds and socioeconomic and political tipping points
   after which ecosystem restoration may become very costly. Our
   application to the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin demonstrates
   the potential of this approach for informing water, drought preparedness
   and mitigation policy, and to contribute to more robust decision-making.

Abstract = {{Visual standardised methods for census of reef fishes have long been
   used in fisheries management and biological surveys. However, these
   tools have inherent sources of bias and the SCUBA divers who perform
   them are highly constrained in terms of survey time, maximum depth and
   frequency of sampling. Alternatives like underwater video are thus being
   recommended in a wide range of configurations. Yet, all these techniques
   are still limited in field of view, particularly when compared to the
   ability of a SCUBA diver performing censuses. In this scope, we
   evaluated the potential of an underwater wide-angle camera (UWC) to
   survey fish assemblages by testing it against instantaneous underwater
   visual census (UVC). Our results showed minimal yet significant
   differences between methods, mainly because of the camera's loss of
   resolution when under extreme visibility conditions. Both approaches had
   the same consistency and ability to detect changes in fish assemblages
   but, to estimate total species richness, the UWC needed less field
   effort. Moreover, a SCUBA diver performing census had an effect on fish
   assemblages which introduced differences of greater magnitude than those
   found between methods. The removal of the diver effect, the proven
   ability to detect changes in fish assemblages and the verified gain in
   field effort, pointed the wide-angle camera as a promising tool to
   perform census of reef fishes. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Alpine ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate
   change. Although long-term and detailed monitoring is required to
   conserve alpine ecosystems, field surveillance and satellite remote
   sensing have difficulties in providing wide coverage or frequent
   observation in mountain areas. In this study, a new method for
   monitoring alpine ecosystems by digital cameras was developed in order
   to detect both snow-cover areas and vegetation phenology at the plant
   community or species level. We used images from cameras that have been
   installed at mountain lodges in the northern Japanese Alps (at
   elevations around 2350-3100 m). Red, green, and blue (RGB) digital
   numbers were derived from each pixel within the images. The snow-cover
   and snow-free pixels were statistically classified by analysis of
   variance of gray-level histograms. A flexible threshold was determined
   for each image to maximize the between-class variance. The temporal
   variations of the snowmelt rate showed site-specific characteristics and
   yearly variations. The snowmelt times reflected the local
   microtopography and differed among the habitats of various functional
   types of vegetation (i.e., evergreen dwarf pine, deciduous shrubs,
   evergreen Sasa, tall forbs, and snowbed plants). In addition, the
   vegetation phenology was quantified by using a vegetation index (green
   ratio) calculated from RGB digital numbers. An increase in the green
   ratio indicated the start of the growing period following snowmelt and a
   decrease indicated leaf senescence. By using pixel-based analysis of the
   temporal variations of the green ratio, local distributions of the start
   and end dates and length of the growing period were illustrated at the
   plant species level for the first time. The distribution of the start of
   the growing period strongly corresponded to the snowmelt gradient,
   whereas the end of the growing period was related to the vegetation
   type. Our results suggest that the length of the growing period mainly
   corresponded to the snowmelt gradient in relation to the local
   microtopography. Thus, commercially available digital time-lapse cameras
   enabled us to clarify the snow vegetation relationships and the growing
   period at high temporal and spatial resolutions. This monitoring method
   should greatly improve our understanding of alpine ecosystems and help
   to assess the influence of future climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The Illinois State Wildlife Action Plan targeted the Conservation
   Reserve Program (CRP) as important improvable acres for grassland and
   grassland-successional bird species of greatest need for conservation. A
   large portion of CRP grasslands in Illinois and elsewhere lack floristic
   and structural diversity because of the absence of management and the
   extensive planting of monotypic grasses such as tall fescue (Schedonorus
   phoenix). The 2006 Farm Bill included the mid-contract management (MCM)
   provision requiring landowners with new CRP enrollments to provide
   habitat improvement midway through the 10-15-year contract duration. We
   compared the effects of 3 approved MCM regimes (i.e., fall strip
   disking, fall glyphosate spraying, fall glyphosate spraying followed by
   spring legume drill-seeding) on grassland bird communities in 60 tall
   fescue-dominated CRP fields in south-central Illinois during 2006-2008.
   We modeled relative density of dickcissels (Spiza americana), Henslow's
   sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii), and eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella
   magna) as a function of microhabitat, patch-level patterns, and
   landscape composition using a multi-scale assessment approach. We
   detected 10 grassland-associated bird species (e.g., Henslow's sparrow,
   northern bobwhite {[}Colinus virginianus], sedge wren {[}Cistothrus
   platensis], Savannah sparrow {[}Passerculus sandwichensis], grasshopper
   sparrow {[}Ammodramus savannarum]) that are recognized as species of
   greatest need for conservation under the Illinois State Wildlife Action
   Plan. Mean total bird densities and species richness were greater in
   glyphosate-sprayed fields (5.0birds/ha; 11.5 species) and glyphosate
   drill-seeded fields (4.4bird/ha; 12.4 species) than in disked
   (3.4birds/ha; 8.7 species) and reference (3.1birds/ha; 7.5 species)
   fields. The avian conservation value of glyphosate sprayed and
   glyphosate drill-seeded fields increased 34.2\% and 32.6\%
   post-management, respectively, but we did not detect change in disked
   and reference fields. Our models indicate that density of each of the
   focal species is likely associated with changes in plant species
   diversity and habitat structure resulting from management actions but is
   also influenced by landscape composition. Despite an overall positive
   response of the grassland bird communities to glyphosate-based treatment
   regimes in tall fescue CRP fields in south-central Illinois, the
   response of Henslow's sparrow density to glyphosate was not consistently
   positive. (c) 2013 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Question Do soils impacted by Tamarix spp. affect the growth of plants
   used for restoration through altered soil chemistry and/or plant-soil
   feedbacks? Location The Bighorn River, the Yellowstone River and the
   Fort Peck Reservoir, Montana, western USA. Methods Soil was collected
   from paired subsites where Tamarix was either present or absent along
   three water bodies. To evaluate chemical and biological soil effects on
   plant growth, eight plant species (Achnatherum hymenoides, Astragalus
   cicer, Dalea candida, Elymus lanceolatus, Leymus cinereus, Pascopyrum
   smithii, Ratibida columnifera and Trifolium pratense) commonly used in
   restoration projects at Tamarix-invaded sites were grown in the
   collected soil. Plant-soil feedbacks were evaluated by growing two
   species (D.candida and P.smithii) in greenhouse soils inoculated with
   small amounts of the field soils. Germination, emergence and growth
   characteristics were compared between Tamarix-invaded and un-invaded
   subsites and across water bodies. Results Seedling emergence and plant
   relative growth rate, total biomass production and allocation of
   resources to roots and shoots were not negatively affected in field
   soils or in greenhouse soil inoculated with soil from areas where
   Tamarix was present. In fact, overall, plants emerged earlier and
   produced more biomass in soils affected by Tamarix than in soils from
   where Tamarix was not present. These results indicate that for sites in
   the northern range of Tamarix, restoration would not be inhibited by
   Tamarix-induced soil changes. Conclusions Tamarix is a relatively new
   invader in the northern USA, and little is known about its impacts in
   this area or the potential implications for restoration. However, our
   results indicate that neither altered soil chemistry nor plant-soil
   feedbacks negatively impact native plant growth, and restoration efforts
   would not be hindered by Tamarix-induced changes to soil chemistry or

Abstract = {{This review focuses on the impacts of climate change on population
   dynamics. I introduce the MUP (Measuring, Understanding, and Predicting)
   approach, which provides a general framework where an enhanced
   understanding of climate-population processes, along with improved
   long-term data, are merged into coherent projections of future
   population responses to climate change. This approach can be applied to
   any species, but this review illustrates its benefit using birds as
   examples. Birds are one of the best-studied groups and a large number of
   studies have detected climate impacts on vital rates (i.e., life history
   traits, such as survival, maturation, or breeding, affecting changes in
   population size and composition) and population abundance. These studies
   reveal multifaceted effects of climate with direct, indirect,
   time-lagged, and nonlinear effects. However, few studies integrate these
   effects into a climate-dependent population model to understand the
   respective role of climate variables and their components (mean state,
   variability, extreme) on population dynamics. To quantify how
   populations cope with climate change impacts, I introduce a new
   universal variable: the population robustness to climate change.' The
   comparison of such robustness, along with prospective and retrospective
   analysis may help to identify the major climate threats and
   characteristics of threatened avian species. Finally, studies projecting
   avian population responses to future climate change predicted by
   IPCC-class climate models are rare. Population projections hinge on
   selecting a multiclimate model ensemble at the appropriate temporal and
   spatial scales and integrating both radiative forcing and internal
   variability in climate with fully specified uncertainties in both
   demographic and climate processes.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change impacts tree species differentially by exerting unique
   pressures and altering their suitable habitats. We previously predicted
   these changes in suitable habitat for current and future climates using
   a species habitat model (DISTRIB) in the eastern United States. Based on
   the accuracy of the model, the species assemblages should eventually
   reflect the new quasi-equilibrium suitable habitats (similar to 2100)
   after accounting for the lag in colonization. However, it is an open
   question if and when these newly suitable habitats will be colonized
   under current fragmented landscapes and realistic migration rates. To
   evaluate this, we used a spatially explicit cell-based model (SHIFT)
   that estimates colonization potentials under current fragmented habitats
   and several estimates of historical migration rates at a 1km resolution.
   Computation time, which was previously the biggest constraint, was
   overcome by a novel application of convolution and Fast Fourier
   Transforms. SHIFT outputs, when intersected with future suitable
   habitats predicted by DISTRIB, allow assessment of colonization
   potential under future climates. In this article, we show how our
   approach can be used to screen multiple tree species for their
   colonization potentials under climate change. In particular, we use the
   DISTRIB and SHIFT models in combination to assess if the future dominant
   forest types in the north will really be dominated by oaks, as modelled
   via DISTRIB. Even under optimistic scenarios, we conclude that only a
   small fraction of the suitable habitats of oaks predicted by DISTRIB is
   likely to be occupied within 100years, and this will be concentrated in
   the first 10-20km from the current boundary. We also show how DISTRIB
   and SHIFT can be used to evaluate the potential for assisted migration
   of vulnerable tree species, and discuss the dynamics of colonization at
   range limits.}},

Abstract = {{Natural forest disturbance regimes are changing, as evidenced by
   expansion of the mountain pine beetle (MPB) north and east from British
   Columbia into pine forests east of the Canadian Rockies. Thus, research
   that examines potential impacts of shifting disturbance regimes on
   ecosystem properties and processes in these forests is needed. We
   examined short-term effects (up to one year after treatment) of three
   treatments that emulated MPB attack and associated forest management
   disturbance (i.e., moderate and high intensity simulated MPB attack,
   salvage harvest) on above-and below-ground properties and processes of
   mature lodgepole pine forests in MPB's recently expanded range east of
   the Rockies. While the salvage logging treatment showed dramatic effects
   on the understory plant community and downed woody material with several
   less dramatic below-ground responses, there were no effects of the
   moderate MPB attack, and only limited below-ground responses to the high
   intensity attack. The salvage logged stands showed decreases in species
   richness and understory plant cover, increases in small downed wood,
   litter cover, forest floor pH, and plant available Ca, Mg, and P, and
   differences in multiple microbial properties compared with the other
   treatments. The high intensity simulated MPB attack showed increased
   respiration rates of several carbon substrates compared with the salvage
   treatment. There was considerable variation among years for many
   below-ground variables (e.g., multiple soil nutrients, microbial
   respiration rates and phospholipid fatty acids), and these were
   unrelated to treatments. For the majority of below-ground response
   variables, differences among study years rather than differences due to
   the MPB treatments suggest that inter-annual variability exerts a
   stronger influence than does disturbance effects of MPB red attack. The
   lack of potential response to MPB attack in the short-term suggests
   these forests are resistant to change early after attack, and/or have
   high ecological inertia. In contrast, salvage logging had immediate and
   dramatic effects. We don't yet know how these pine forests will develop
   under this modified disturbance regime of partial canopy disturbance,
   but it appears likely that salvage logging will push these stands in a
   potentially very different direction than the modified natural
   disturbance regime due to MPB will.}},

Abstract = {{The application of functional approaches in understanding phytoplankton
   community-level responses to changes in the environment has become
   increasingly widespread in recent years. Eutrophication is known to
   cause profound modifications in ecosystem processes; however, the
   underlying relationships between environmental drivers and phytoplankton
   diversity and functioning are complex and largely unknown. Therefore, in
   the present study, we investigated and compared the temporal diversity
   patterns of phytoplankton functional groups in the mesotrophic eastern
   and eutrophic western basin of the shallow Lake Balaton situated in
   Hungary. Diversity data were derived from taxonomic composition and
   biomass data corresponding to the years 2005-2006 and 2008-2009. With
   the use of cluster analysis, phytoplankton species were classified into
   eight distinct groups representing different combinations of
   functionally relevant traits including greatest axial linear dimension;
   surface-to-volume ratio; photosynthetic pigment composition; N-2
   fixation; phagotrophic potential; growth form/complexity (unicell,

Abstract = {{As the consequence of complex interactions between different parts of an
   organ, shape can be used as a predictor of structural-functional
   relationships implicated in changing environments. Despite such
   importance, however, it is no surprise that little is known about the
   genetic detail involved in shape variation, because no approach is
   currently available for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that
   control shape. Here, we address this problem by developing a statistical
   model that integrates the principle of shape analysis into a
   mixture-model-based likelihood formulated for QTL mapping. One
   state-of-the-art approach for shape analysis is to identify and analyze
   the polar coordinates of anatomical landmarks on a shape measured in
   terms of radii from the centroid to the contour at regular intervals. A
   procrustes analysis is used to align shapes to filter out position,
   scale and rotation effects on shape variation. To the end, the accurate
   and quantitative representation of a shape is produced with aligned
   radius-centroid-contour (RCC) curves, that is, a function of radial
   angle at the centroid. The high dimensionality of the RCC data, crucial
   for a comprehensive description of the geometric feature of a shape, is
   reduced by principal component (PC) analysis, and the resulting PC axes
   are treated as phenotypic traits, allowing specific QTLs for global and
   local shape variability to be mapped, respectively. The usefulness and
   utilization of the new model for shape mapping in practice are validated
   by analyzing a mapping data collected from a natural population of
   poplar, Populus szechuanica var tibetica, and identifying several QTLs
   for leaf shape in this species. The model provides a powerful tool to
   compute which genes determine biological shape in plants, animals and
   humans.}},

Abstract = {{Species distribution model (SDMs) is increasingly used to determine the
   distribution range of individual species and identify biodiversity
   hotspots. Of many technical issues, model over-fitting or
   over-parameterization is a major concern, which can lead to severe
   under-prediction. However, under-fitting and over-prediction may also
   occur if species requirements for environment are inadequately modeled.
   We used the collection data of stoneflies (Plecoptera, Insecta) from
   Illinois, USA to examine how often and severely maximum entropy (Maxent)
   over- or under-predicts species richness and species-occurrence
   frequency. A recently proposed AICc-based method (Warren and Seifert,
   2011) was used for model-complexity control or regularization.
   Twenty-nine historically well-sampled watersheds were used to validate
   the predictions. The standard models, which used the default
   regularization (beta = 1), over- or under-predicted, depending on the
   watershed, species, and threshold used for converting suitability score
   into species presence-absence. The AICc-selected models (beta = 7-40)
   used 77\% less parameters, but often strongly and consistently
   over-predicted. Three thresholds, equal training sensitivity and
   specificity, maximizing training sensitivity and specificity (MTSS) and
   minimum training presence, yielded most accurate estimates. Accordingly,
   we developed standard models for 41 species and identified the
   historically species-rich watersheds in Illinois. Our results offer new
   insight into the effects of regularization and choices of thresholds on
   Maxent performances. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The drivers of species diversification and persistence are of great
   interest to current biogeography, especially in those global
   biodiversity hotspots' harbouring most of Earth's animal and plant life.
   Classical multispecies biogeographical work has yielded fascinating
   insights into broad-scale patterns of diversification, and DNA-based
   intraspecific phylogeographical studies have started to complement this
   picture at much finer temporal and spatial scales. The advent of novel
   next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provides the opportunity
   to greatly scale up the numbers of individuals, populations and species
   sampled, potentially merging intraspecific and interspecific approaches
   to biogeographical inference. Here, we outline these prospects and
   issues by using the example of an undisputed hotspot, the Cape of
   southern Africa. We outline the current state of knowledge on the
   biogeography of species diversification within the Cape, review the
   literature for phylogeographical evidence of its likely drivers and
   mechanisms, and suggest possible ways forward based on NGS approaches.
   We demonstrate the potential of these methods and current bioinformatic
   issues with the help of restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing
   data for three highly divergent species of the Restionaceae, an
   important plant radiation in the Cape. A thorough understanding of the
   mechanisms that facilitate species diversification and persistence in
   spatially structured, species-rich environments will require the

Abstract = {{We present the results of a full year of high-resolution monitoring of
   hydrologic event-driven export of stream dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   from the forested Bigelow Brook watershed in Harvard Forest,
   Massachusetts, USA. A combination of in situ fluorescent dissolved
   organic matter (FDOM) measurement, grab samples, and bioassays was
   utilized. FDOM was identified as a strong indicator of concentration for
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC, r (2) = 0.96), dissolved organic nitrogen
   (DON, r (2) = 0.81), and bioavailable DOC (BDOC, r (2) = 0.81).
   Relationships between FDOM and concentration were utilized to improve
   characterization of patterns of hydrological event-driven export and the
   quantification of annual export. This characterization was possible
   because DOM composition remained relatively consistent seasonally;
   however, a subtle shift to increased fluorescence per unit absorbance
   was observed for summer and fall seasons and percent BDOC did increase
   slightly with increasing concentrations. The majority of export occurred
   during pulsed hydrological events, so the greatest impact of
   bioavailable exports may be on downstream aquatic ecosystems. Export
   from individual events was highly seasonal in nature with the highest
   flow weighted mean concentrations (DOCFW) being observed in late summer
   and fall months, but the highest total export being observed for larger
   winter storms. Seasonal trends in DOC export coincide with weather
   driven changes in surface and subsurface flow paths, potential for
   depletion and rebuilding of a flushable soil organic matter pool, and
   the availability of terrestrial carbon sources such as leaf litter. Our
   approach and findings demonstrate the utility of high frequency FDOM
   measurement to improve estimates of intra-annual temporal trends of DOM

Abstract = {{Cuffney and Qian (2013) performed numerous simulations to demonstrate
   potential flaws in Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN), a method
   for interpreting taxon contributions to community change along novel
   environmental gradients. Based on their simulations, they concluded
   that: 1) TITAN is not an effective method for detecting different types
   of statistical thresholds in trend lines, 2) permutation results in
   highly significant p-values even for splits that are not thresholds, and
   3) coincident change points may arise as an artifact of inaccuracies,
   imprecision, and systematic bias in both change-point estimation and
   TITAN's bootstrap. The critique raises some important concerns, but
   because of significant misunderstanding, it is based on analyses that
   violate basic assumptions of both TITAN and indicator species analysis
   (IndVal), and thus, constitutes a straw man that cannot be used to
   evaluate their performance. We demonstrate that the critique: 1)
   fundamentally misrepresents TITAN's primary goals; 2) simulates taxon
   abundances based on unrealistic statistical models that fail to
   represent important empirical patterns present in Cuffney and Qian's own
   published data sets (i.e., negative binomial distributions, frequent
   absences a function of the predictor); 3) tests TITAN's ability to
   identify breaks in trend lines distorted by log-transformation that do
   not match the greatest change in the simulated response, leading to
   misinterpretation of expected and previously documented behavior by
   TITAN as errors; 4) misinterprets TITAN's use of p-values while ignoring
   diagnostic indices of purity and reliability for identifying robust
   indicator taxa; and 5) asserts that bootstrapped change-point quantiles
   in TITAN are too narrow despite published results to the contrary. Last,
   in contrast to the claim that change-point synchrony may be an artifact
   of the technique, we show that: 6) analysis of published data using
   completely independent methods (i.e., scatterplots of abundance data or
   generalized additive models) also reveals synchrony in the nonlinear
   decline of numerous taxa in corroboration of TITAN and its underlying
   conceptual model. Thus, Cuffney and Qian have not identified any serious
   limitations of TITAN because their critique is based on
   misinterpretation of TITAN's assumptions and primary objectives.
   However, their critique does highlight the need for clarification of the
   appropriate uses, potential misuses, and limitations of TITAN and other
   methods for ecological analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Since the collapse of Central and Eastern Europe's communist regimes in
   the early 1990s, the ensuing environmental, social and economic changes
   have permitted development of new forms of multi-level governance.
   However, a coherent participatory approach to environmental conservation
   is yet to emerge. This review examines the changing approaches in
   environmental conservation and protected area governance in Romania
   during the country's pre-communist, communist, transition and current
   European Union eras. Three case examples are examined in depth to assess
   how changing environmental governance is playing out in practice in
   Natura 2000 sites, in a national park, and on privately owned
   (unprotected) forest land. Similar to other countries in Central and
   Eastern Europe, Romania's environmental governance practices still face
   substantial challenges in consolidating an inclusive and integrated
   approach to environmental governance and conservation. A lack of
   historical involvement of communities in decision making, reluctance
   within government to drive forward more inclusive environmental
   governance approaches, and a lack of non-governmental organizations
   focusing on environmental conservation, have resulted in slow progress
   towards more inclusive environmental governance. Civil society and
   solutions for institutionalizing participation across all levels of

Abstract = {{Most lowland rivers in the southwestern United States have been
   impounded, diverted, or dewatered. Lack of flooding due to river
   impoundments on the Middle Rio Grande has contributed to the spread of
   exotic vegetation such as Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) and
   saltcedar (Tamarix) associated with fuel loads of dense understory.
   Management has largely focused on thinning of understory vegetation to
   remove nonnative species and reduce fire risk, but it is unclear how
   these actions impact avian populations. Using distance-sampling methods,
   we quantified densities of five groups of birds (birds nesting in
   canopy, midstory, and understory; water-obligates; and spring migrants)
   across 12 types of vegetation spanning managed and nonmanaged stands. We
   used a space-for-time substitution model to estimate changes in
   abundance of birds from scenarios that applied four possible options for
   management at the landscape scale. One option, mechanical clearing of
   cottonwood understory, had severe detrimental impacts for abundances of
   the three nesting guilds and spring migrants when applied across the
   study area. A hand-thinning method to remove most exotics but retain
   native shrubs and the ground layer also negatively impacted birds
   nesting in understory but had positive or no effect on the other four
   groups of birds. Over the short term (5-10 years), not clearing would
   increase the proportion of native and nonnative understory and generally
   increase abundances of birds. With application of `'no management'' over
   a longer period (50-75 years), we assumed transition of most cottonwood
   (Populus deltoides var. wislizeii) stands to shrublands of Russian olive
   and projected that canopy-nesting birds would decrease but other groups
   would increase. A scenario of wetland restoration that converted 25\% of
   open habitat to wetland increased abundances of understory-nesting birds
   slightly and water-obligate birds substantially. Our projections of
   changes in avian populations will help managers evaluate biological
   impacts of management being considered for the Middle Rio Grande.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{468-477}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 sets as an objective the
   restoration of 15\% of degraded ecosystems by 2020. This challenge
   raises at least two major questions: (i) How to restore and (ii) how to
   measure restoration success of said ecosystems? Measurement of
   restoration success is necessary to assess objective achievement and to
   adjust management with regard to objectives. Numerous studies are being
   conducted to try to work out synthetic indices to assess ecosystem
   diversity or integrity in the context of global change. Nevertheless, at
   the community level, there is no index that allows the assessment of
   community integrity regarding its restoration or resilience, despite the
   fact that a lot of indicators are used such as species richness, Shannon
   diversity, multivariate analyses or similarity indices. We have
   therefore developed two new indices giving new insights on community
   states: the first index, coined as the Community Structure Integrity
   Index, measures the proportion of the species abundance in the reference
   community represented in the restored or degraded community, and the
   second index, coined as the Higher Abundance Index, measures the
   proportion of the species abundance in the restored or degraded
   community which is higher than in the reference community. We illustrate
   and discuss the use of these new indices with three examples: (i)
   fictitious communities, (ii) a recent restoration (2 years) of a
   Mediterranean temporary wetland (Camargue in France) in order to assess
   restoration efficiency, and (iii) a recently disturbed pseudo-steppe
   plant community (La Crau area in France) in order to assess natural
   resilience of the plant community. The indices provide summarized
   information on the success of restoration or on the resilience of the
   plant community, which both appear less positive than with standard
   indicators already used. The indices also provide additional insights
   useful for management purposes: the Community Structure Integrity Index
   can indicate whether the improving target species abundance is needed or
   not while the Higher Abundance Index can indicate whether controlling
   the high abundance of some species is needed in order to approach a
   reference ecosystem. These relatively simple indices developed on
   community composition and structure state can provide a base to further
   indices focusing on ecosystem functioning or services not only
   calculating values as a static point but also its temporal or spatial
   dynamic. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Mayan of Mexico}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Background: New kinds of knowledge, usage patterns and management
   strategies of natural resources emerge in local communities as a way of
   coping with uncertainty in a changing world. Studying how human groups
   adapt and create new livelihoods strategies are important research
   topics for creating policies in natural resources management. Here, we
   study the adoption and development of lagartos (Crocodylus moreletii)
   commercial hunting by Mayan people from a communal land in Quintana Roo
   state. Two questions guided our work: how did the Mayan learn to hunt
   lagartos? And how, and in what context, did knowledge and management
   practices emerge? We believe that social structures, knowledge and
   preexisting skills facilitate the hunting learning process, but lagarto
   ecological knowledge and organizational practice were developed in a
   ``learning by doing{''} process.
   Methods: We conducted free, semi-structured and in-depth interviews over
   17 prestigious lagartos hunters who reconstructed the activity through
   oral history. Then, we analyzed the sources of information and routes of
   learning and investigated the role of previous knowledge and social
   organization in the development of this novel activity. Finally, we
   discussed the emergence of hunting in relation to the characteristic of
   natural resource and the tenure system.
   Results: Lagarto hunting for skin selling was a short-term activity,
   which represented an alternative source of money for some Mayans known
   as lagarteros. They acquired different types of knowledge and skills
   through various sources of experience (individual practice, or from
   foreign hunters and other Mayan hunters). The developed management
   system involved a set of local knowledge about lagartos ecology and a
   social organization structure that was then articulated in the formation
   of ``working groups{''} with particular hunting locations (rumbos and
   trabajaderos), rotation strategies and collaboration among them. Access
   rules and regulations identified were in an incipient state of
   development and were little documented.
   Conclusions: In agreement to the hypothesis proposed, the Mayan used
   multiple learning paths to develop a new activity: the lagarto hunting.
   On the one hand, they used their traditional social organization
   structure as well as their culturally inherited knowledge. On the other
   hand, they acquired new ecological knowledge of the species in a
   learning-by-doing process, together with the use of other sources of
   external information. The formation of working groups, the exchange of
   information and the administration of hunting locations are similar to
   other productive activities and livelihood practiced by these Mayan.
   Skills such as preparing skins and lagartos ecological knowledge were
   acquired by foreign hunters and during hunting practice, respectively.
   We detected a feedback between local ecological knowledge and social
   organization, which in turn promoted the emergence of Mayan hunting
   management practices.}},

   Erythropitta erythrogaster usingmolecular, phylogeographic and
   population genetics methods, as well as morphometric and plumage
   analyses. Our results suggest that E. erythrogaster colonized the
   Indo-Pacific during the Pleistocene in an eastward direction following a
   stepping stone pathway, and that sea-level fluctuations during the
   Pleistocene may have promoted gene flow only locally. A molecular
   species delimitation test suggests that several allopatric island
   populations of E. erythrogaster may be regarded as species. Most of
   these putative new species are further characterized by diagnostic
   differences in plumage. Our study reconfirms the E. erythrogaster
   complex as a `great speciator': it represents a complex of up to 17
   allopatrically distributed, reciprocally monophyletic and/or
   morphologically diagnosable species that originated during the
   Pleistocene. Our results support the view that observed latitudinal
   gradients of genetic divergence among avian sister species may have been
   affected by incomplete knowledge of taxonomic limits in tropical bird
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Comparative analyses of primate brain evolution have highlighted changes
   in size and internal organization as key factors underlying species
   diversity. It remains, however, unclear (i) how much variation in mosaic
   brain reorganization versus variation in relative brain size contributes
   to explaining the structural neural diversity observed across species,
   (ii) which mosaic changes contribute most to explaining diversity, and
   (iii) what the temporal origin, rates and processes are that underlie
   evolutionary shifts in mosaic reorganization for individual branches of
   the primate tree of life. We address these questions by combining novel
   comparative methods that allow assessing the temporal origin, rate and
   process of evolutionary changes on individual branches of the tree of
   life, with newly available data on volumes of key brain structures
   (prefrontal cortex, frontal motor areas and cerebro-cerebellum) for a
   sample of 17 species (including humans). We identify patterns of mosaic
   change in brain evolution that mirror brain systems previously
   identified by electrophysiological and anatomical tract-tracing studies
   in non-human primates and functional connectivity MRI studies in humans.
   Across more than 40 Myr of anthropoid primate evolution, mosaic changes
   contribute more to explaining neural diversity than changes in relative
   brain size, and different mosaic patterns are differentially selected
   for when brains increase or decrease in size. We identify
   lineage-specific evolutionary specializations for all branches of the
   tree of life covered by our sample and demonstrate deep evolutionary
   roots for mosaic patterns associated with motor control and learning.}},

Title = {{Modeling biopore effects on root growth and biomass production on soils
   with pronounced sub-soil clay accumulation}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{256}},
Pages = {{6-15}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Soils with subsoil clay accumulation account for more than 20\% of the
   global land surface. These soils are characterized by vertical
   differences with respect to soil texture and increasing bulk density
   below the topsoil, which in turn affects root penetration into the
   subsoil. Biopores are preferential pathways for roots and assist in
   overcoming physical barriers like high density soil layers. An
   integration of these relationships into cropping systems models at the
   field scale is on-going. This paper presents a new approach to model the
   effect of biopores on root development in soils with clay accumulation
   at the plot scale. In this approach, the effect of biopores on root
   elongation rate depends on bulk density and on a biopore-root growth
   threshold (MPRT), which is the biopore volume at which the resistance of
   soil strength to root penetration is completely offset by the density of
   the biopores. The approach was integrated into a model solution of the
   model framework SIMPLACE (Scientific Impact assessment and Modeling
   PLatform for Advanced Crop and Ecosystem management). MPRT was
   parameterized for spring wheat using the inverse modeling approach based
   on root observations from a multi-factorial field experiment on a Haplic
   Luvisol. The observed biopore densities (>2 mm diameter) were between
   300 and 660 pores m(-2) (equivalent to a volumetric proportion of
   0.38-0.83\%) depending on the preceding crop. Observed soil bulk
   densities ranged between 1.31 and 1.62 g cm(-3). For spring wheat, the
   best fit between simulated and observed root densities in different
   layers was obtained with a MPRT of 0.023 m(3) m(-3) (equivalent to 2.3\%
   of soil volume). The mean simulated total above ground biomass was
   sensitive to MPRT and had the best agreement with observed values when a
   MPRT between 0.023 and 0.032 m(3) m(-3) was used in the simulations.
   Scenario simulations with the parameterized model at the same site
   demonstrate the importance of biopores for biomass production of
   short-cycle spring wheat when prolonged dry spells occur. The
   simulations allow a rough quantification of the biopore effects with
   respect to root elongation rate and biomass production at the plot scale
   with the potential to be extended to the field scale. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{58-66}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Traditional management practiced over centuries in Mediterranean
   cultural landscapes has led to singular agrosilvopastoral ecosystems
   such as dehesas. Recent abandonment of dehesa management has resulted in
   shrub encroachment, habitat homogenisation and increased fire risk.
   Mechanical shrub cutting to decrease biomass load creates novel cleared
   dehesas with yet unknown consequences for the ecosystem function. We
   investigated the effects of these land use changes on ground dwelling
   beetles (carabids and staphylinids) as model organisms by comparing
   traditionally grazed, long-time abandoned and newly cleared dehesas.
   Land use changes affected beetle species composition by altering habitat
   structure (e.g., litter layer) and the availability of feeding
   resources. Grazed dehesas held the highest number of exclusive species
   and particular functional guilds of carabid seed eaters and staphylinid
   coprophiles, utilizing food resources related to the presence of grazing
   livestock (annual herbs and coprophagous insects). Beetle assemblages of
   abandoned dehesas, resembling those known from surrounding human
   disturbed oak forests, exhibited the lowest abundance and greatly
   differed from beetle assemblages of grazed dehesas. Shrub clearance
   after dehesa abandonment benefited opportunistic beetle predators
   feeding on decomposers associated with cutting slash left on the ground.
   The habitat structure and beetle species composition of cleared dehesas
   slightly approached those of grazed dehesas, therefore suggesting shrub
   cutting as a first step towards restoration of abandoned dehesas.
   However, since livestock grazing is an essential driver of ground
   dwelling beetle composition, it should be promoted after shrub cutting
   in cleared dehesas to restore the characteristic assemblages, species
   interactions and ecosystem function of grazed dehesas. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{While numerous scientific publications have used biological data and
   sometimes decision theory to identify where conservation funds should be
   invested, studies that examine where money for conservation actually has
   been spent and how investment patterns have changed through time are
   scarce. We analyze changing spatial patterns of spending on land
   protection, using investments by a major conservation organization, The
   Nature Conservancy (TNC), in the conterminous United States as a case
   study. We focus on investments in land protection made by TNC in four
   decades (1970-2009) using fee simple and easement acquisitions. During
   this period, TNC expanded and accelerated its investments in land
   conservation. We compare patterns of conservation investment in
   different states via two metrics: (1) the amount TNC spent to acquire
   land for protection, and (2) the overall area protected. The two
   metrics, while correlated, reveal different information about TNC's
   investment patterns. The amount of conservation activity TNC undertook
   in different states shows pronounced variation when measured either by
   the overall area protected or the cost of acquiring that area. We used a
   regression approach to relate variation in investment levels across
   states in each decade to a suite of biological and socioeconomic factors
   relevant to the effectiveness of conservation resource allocation
   decisions. Through time, these variables are able to explain greater
   spatial variation in the levels of investment into different states. The
   richness of native species per state showed the strongest association
   with overall investment levels. However, land costs also influenced
   investment patterns in recent decades but in ways that differed when
   measured by the overall area protected and by the money spent to protect
   it. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Population viability analysis (PVA) is used to quantify the risks
   faced by species under alternative management regimes. Bayesian PVAs
   allow uncertainty in the parameters of the underlying population model
   to be easily propagated through to the predictions. We developed a
   Bayesian stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) and used this model to
   assess the viability of a metapopulation of the growling grass frog
   (Litoria raniformis) under different urbanization scenarios. Location
   Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Methods We fitted a Bayesian model that
   accounted for imperfect detection to a multiseason occupancy dataset for
   L.raniformis collected across northern Melbourne. The probability of
   extinction was modelled as a function of effective wetland area, aquatic
   vegetation cover and connectivity, using logistic regression. The
   probability of colonization was modelled as a function of connectivity
   alone. We then simulated the dynamics of a metapopulation of
   L.raniformis subject to differing levels of urbanization and
   compensatory wetland creation. Uncertainty was propagated by conducting
   simulations for 5000 estimates of the parameters of the models for
   extinction and colonization. Results There was considerable uncertainty
   in both the probability of quasi-extinction and the minimum number of
   occupied wetlands under most urbanization scenarios. Uncertainty around
   the change in quasi-extinction risk and minimum metapopulation size
   increased with increasing habitat loss. For our focal metapopulation,
   the analysis revealed that significant investment in new wetlands may be
   required to offset the impacts of urbanization. Main conclusions
   Bayesian approaches to PVA allow parametric uncertainty to be propagated
   and considered in management decisions. They also provide means of
   identifying parameters that represent critical uncertainties, and,
   through the use of informative priors, can easily assimilate new data to
   reduce parametric uncertainty. These advantages, and the ready
   availability of software to run Bayesian analyses, will ensure that
   Bayesian approaches are used increasingly for PVAs.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{99-113}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Plant-soil feedbacks can have important implications for the
   interactions among plants. Understanding these effects is a major
   challenge since it is inherently difficult to measure and manipulate
   highly diverse soil communities. Mathematical models may advance this
   understanding by making the interplay of the various processes affecting
   plant-soil interaction explicit and by quantifying the relative
   importance of the factors involved. The aim of this paper is to provide
   a complete analysis of a pioneering plant-soil feedback model developed
   by Bever and colleagues (J Ecol 85: 561-573, 1997; Ecol Lett 2: 52-62,
   1999; New Phytol 157: 465-473, 2003) to fully understand the range of
   possible impacts of plant-soil feedbacks on plant communities within
   this framework. We analyze this model by means of a new graphical method
   that provides a complete classification of the potential effects of soil
   communities on plant competition. Due to the graphical character of the
   method, the results are relatively easy to obtain and understand. We
   show that plant diversity depends crucially on two key parameters that
   may be viewed as measures of the intensity of plant competition and the
   direction and strength of plant-soil feedback, respectively. Our
   analysis provides a formal underpinning of earlier claims that
   plant-soil feedbacks, especially when they are negative, may enhance the
   diversity of plant communities. In particular, negative plant-soil
   feedbacks can enhance the range of plant coexistence by inducing
   competitive oscillations. However, these oscillations can also
   destabilize plant coexistence, leading to low population densities and
   extinctions. In addition, positive feedbacks can allow locally stable
   forms of plant coexistence by inducing alternative stable states. Our
   findings highlight that the inclusion of plant-soil interactions may
   fundamentally alter the predictions on the structure and functioning of
   above-ground ecosystems. The scenarios presented in this study can be
   used to formulate hypotheses about the ways soil community effects may
   influence plant competition that can be tested with empirical studies.
   This will advance our understanding of the role of plant-soil feedback
   in ecological communities.}},

Abstract = {{We used two-dimensional hydrodynamic models for the assessment of water
   diversion effects on benthic macroinvertebrates and associated habitat
   in a montane stream in Yosemite National Park, Sierra Nevada Mountains,
   CA, USA. We sampled the macroinvertebrate assemblage via Surber
   sampling, recorded detailed measurements of bed topography and flow, and
   coupled a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model with macroinvertebrate
   indicators to assess habitat across a range of low flows in 2010 and
   representative past years. We also made zero flow approximations to
   assess response of fauna to extreme conditions. The fauna of this
   montane reach had a higher percentage of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and
   Trichoptera (\%EPT) than might be expected given the relatively low
   faunal diversity of the study reach. The modeled responses of wetted
   area and area-weighted macroinvertebrate metrics to decreasing discharge
   indicated precipitous declines in metrics as flows approached zero.
   Changes in area-weighted metrics closely approximated patterns observed
   for wetted area, i.e., area-weighted invertebrate metrics contributed
   relatively little additional information above that yielded by wetted
   area alone. Loss of habitat area in this montane stream appears to be a
   greater threat than reductions in velocity and depth or changes in
   substrate, and the modeled patterns observed across years support this
   conclusion. Our models suggest that step function losses of wetted area
   may begin when discharge in the Merced falls to 0.02 m(3)/s;
   proportionally reducing diversions when this threshold is reached will
   likely reduce impacts in low flow years. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Markov decision processes have become the standard tool for modeling
   sequential decision-making problems in conservation. In many real-world
   applications, however, it is practically infeasible to accurately
   parameterize the state transition function. In this study, we introduce
   a new way of dealing with ambiguity in the state transition function. In
   contrast to existing methods, we explore the effects of uncertainty at
   the level of the policy, rather than at the level of decisions within
   states. We use information-gap decision theory to ask the question of
   how much uncertainty in the state transition function can be tolerated
   while still delivering a specified expected value given by the objective
   function. Accordingly, the goal of the optimization problem is no longer
   to maximize expected value, but to maximize local robustness to
   uncertainty (while still meeting the desired level of performance). We
   analyze a simple land acquisition problem, using info-gap decision
   theory to propagate uncertainties and rank alternative policies. Rather
   than requiring information about the extent of parameter uncertainty at
   the outset, info-gap addresses the question of how much uncertainty is
   permissible in the state transition function before the optimal policy

   changes in four case study systems: tropical coastal floodplains,
   temperate streams, high mountain streams and urban riparian zones. We
   concentrate on functional groups rather than individual species and
   consider dispersal constraints and the capacity for genetic adaptation.
   Our scenarios suggest that climatic changes will reduce indigenous
   diversity, facilitate non-indigenous invasion (especially C4
   graminoids), increase fragmentation and result in simplified and less
   distinctive riparian ecosystems. Compared to models based on
   biota-environment correlations, process models built on mechanistic
   understanding (like Bayesian belief networks) are more likely to remain
   valid under novel climatic conditions. We posit that predictions based
   on species' functional traits will facilitate regional comparisons and
   can highlight effects of climate change on ecosystem structure and
   function. Ecosystems that have experienced similar modification to that
   expected under climate change (for example, altered flow regimes of
   regulated rivers) can be used to help inform and evaluate predictions.
   By manipulating attributes of these system models (for example,
   magnitude of climatic changes or adaptation strategies used),
   implications of various scenarios can be assessed and optimal management
   strategies identified.}},

Abstract = {{Declining soil productivity is one of the greatest challenges facing
   smallholder agriculture. This study assessed effects of reduced tillage
   and mulching on soil organic carbon, bulk density, infiltration and

   ploughing, ripping and planting basins) combined factorially with mulch
   levels (0, 0.5, I, 2, 4, 8 and 10 t ha(-1)). The experiment was run for
   four growing seasons allowing for a rotation of maize, cowpea and
   sorghum in some of the fields. A new experimental field was opened each
   year and maintained in subsequent seasons until the end of the
   experiment.
   Soil organic carbon increased with time in all tillage systems and more
   SOC gained in planting basins. Soil bulk density decreased with time in
   all tillage systems irrespective of mulch quantity applied. Ripping
   loosened the soil much deeper than the other tillage methods. Total
   infiltration in all treatments was similar over the four seasons. Soil
   structural changes resulted in increased unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity and sorptivity of the clay loam soil. Maize yield increased
   with time in all treatments. Long term studies need to be conducted to

Abstract = {{Most evaluations of the economic impacts of invasive species are done

   the effects of invasive species on non-market services such as
   biodiversity and landscapes can be considerable. A proactive approach of
   assessing the expected economic impact of invasive species prior to
   their occurrence may contribute to greater efficiency of policy makers.
   Here we used a stated preference method for a priori evaluating the
   willingness of the population to pay for different control programs of a
   new invasive bee species in Israel, the dwarf honey bee, Apis florea. We
   evaluated possible economic impacts of A. florea using two model plant
   species expected to be adversely affected by its invasion due to
   decreased pollination. The plants have no market value but they add
   aesthetic value to the open landscape. Using a mixed logit model we
   found that the mean willingness to pay (WTP) differed between the model
   plants, and increased with the extent of plant loss. Respondents
   differentiated between levels of damage to the plants and between
   control methods in their preferences for a specific program. Our results
   provide means for informed proactive decision making in preventing the

Abstract = {{We present a new model system, which facilitates scaling of ecosystem
   processes from the site to regional simulation domains. The new
   framework LandscapeDNDC-partly based on the biogeochemical site scale
   model DNDC-inherits a series of new features with regard to process
   descriptions, model structure and data I/O functionality. LandscapeDNDC
   incorporates different vegetation types and management systems for
   simulating carbon, nitrogen and water related
   biosphere-atmosphere-hydrosphere fluxes in forest, arable and grassland
   ecosystems and allows the dynamic simulation of land use changes. The
   modeling concept divides ecosystems into six substates (canopy air
   chemistry, microclimate, physiology, water cycle, vegetation structure,
   and soil biogeochemistry) and provides alternative modules dealing with
   these substates. The model can be applied on the site scale, as well as
   for three-dimensional regional simulations. For regional applications
   LandscapeDNDC integrates all grid cells synchronously forward in time.
   This allows easy coupling to other spatially distributed models (e.g.
   for hydrology or atmospheric chemistry) and efficient two-way exchange
   of states. This paper describes the fundamental design concept of the
   model and its object-oriented software implementation. Two example
   applications are presented. First, calculation of a nitrous oxide
   emission inventory from agricultural soils for the State of Saxaony
   (Germany), including data preprocessing of the regional model input
   data. The computational effort for the LandscapeDNDC preprocessing and
   simulation could be speed up by a factor of almost 100 compared to the
   approach using the original DNDC version 9.3. Calculated N2O emissions
   for Saxony with LandscapeDNDC (2693 t N2O-N/a) were compared with the
   original DNDC model (2725 t N2O-N/a), the IPCC Tier I methodology (1107
   t N2O-N/a), and the German National Inventory Report (equal to IPCC Tier
   II, 2100 t N2O-N/a). The second example illustrates the capabilities of
   LandscapeDNDC for building a fully coupled three-dimensional model
   system on the landscape scale. Therefore we coupled the biogeochemical
   and plant growth calculations to a hydrological transport model and
   demonstrate the transport of nitrogen along a virtual hillslope and
   associated formation of indirect nitrous oxide emissions.}},

Abstract = {{In common with human speech, song is culturally inherited in oscine
   passerine birds (songbirds'). Intraspecific divergence in birdsong, such
   as development of local dialects, might be an important early step in
   the speciation process. It is therefore vital to understand how songs
   diverge, especially in founding populations. The northward expansion of
   the Light-vented Bulbul Pycnonotus sinensis (J. F. Gmelin, 1789) into
   north China in the last 30years provides an excellent opportunity to
   study birdsong evolution. We compared similar to 4400 songs from newly
   established northern populations with similar to 2900 songs from
   southern populations to evaluate song divergence after recent expansion.
   The total pool of syllables and especially song types was considerably
   smaller in the north than in the south, indicating founder effects' in
   the new population. The ancestral pattern of mosaic song dialects
   changed into a pattern of wide geographical sharing of a few song types
   and syllables, likely the result of fewer geographical barriers to meme
   flow', and the recent spread across a large area in the north. Our
   results suggest that song evolution and vocal trait shifts can arise
   rapidly after range expansion, and that in the Light-vented Bulbul
   founder effects', geographical isolation, and recent rapid expansions
   played important roles in the evolution of song dialects.}},

Abstract = {{In 2012, the United States Forest Service (USFS) promulgated new
   planning regulations in accordance with the National Forest Management
   Act (NFMA). These regulations represent the most significant change in
   federal forest policy in decades and have sweeping implications for
   wildlife populations. We provide a brief overview of the history of the
   NFMA planning regulations and their wildlife provisions and review the
   current science on planning for effective wildlife conservation at the
   landscape scale. We then discuss the approach to wildlife conservation
   planning in the 2012 rule and compare it to alternatives that were not
   selected and previous iterations of the planning rule. The new planning
   rule is of concern because of its highly discretionary nature and the
   inconsistency between its intent on the one hand and operational
   requirements on the other. Therefore, we recommend that the USFS include
   in the Directives for implementing the rule commitments to directly
   monitor populations of selected species of conservation concern and
   focal species and to maintain the viability of both categories of
   species. Additional guidance must be included to ensure the effective
   selection of species of conservation concern and focal species, and
   these categories should overlap when possible. If the USFS determines
   that the planning unit is not inherently capable of maintaining viable
   populations of a species, this finding should be made available for
   scientific review and public comment, and in such cases the USFS should
   commit to doing nothing that would further impair the viability of such
   species. In cases where extrinsic factors decrease the viability of
   species, the USFS has an increased, not lessened, responsibility to
   protect those species. Monitoring plans must include trigger points that
   will initiate a review of management actions, and plans must include
   provisions to ensure monitoring takes place as planned. If wildlife
   provisions in forest plans are implemented so that they are enforceable
   and ensure consistency between intent and operational requirements, this
   will help to prevent the need for additional listings under the
   Endangered Species Act and facilitate delisting. Although the
   discretionary nature of the wildlife provisions in the planning rule
   gives cause for concern, forward-thinking USFS officials have the
   opportunity under the 2012 rule to create a robust and effective
   framework for wildlife conservation planning. (c) 2013 The Wildlife

Abstract = {{Biological inventory is a crucial activity in life sciences field
   research. However, it is sometimes time-consuming and laborious to take
   representative samplings of communities, especially in the case of
   invertebrates. In this paper, we address the issue of sampling
   efficiency and its influence on obtained results. As a study system, we
   used data on epigeic carabid beetles (Carabidae) collected in 1999-2001
   in the Warta River valley of western Poland. We trapped a total of
   17,722 individuals belonging to 108 species. However, due to rarefaction
   methods, the expected number of species was estimated at 134-140,
   suggesting that from 26 to 32 species are missing from the material,
   even expressed as a huge number of collected specimens. The estimated
   probability that another captured individual will represent a new
   species (i.e. a species that was not already recorded) is 0.0010. In
   order to record all the species present in the study area, another
   193,338 individuals need to be sampled (abundance-based approach) or
   another 1,871 samples need to be collected (incidence-based approach).
   This means that the collected material should be 10.9 times greater (or
   7.9 times greater for incidence-based data) than what was actually
   collected in order to record all the species present in the study area.
   The results show that, in practice, full inventory is simply nearly
   impossible to achieve, and this knowledge should be included in
   inventory planning. Therefore, we argue that species accumulation curves
   and unseen species estimators need to be carefully examined and
   threshold probability of detecting a new species should be built into
   the design of inventory science. The ratio between recorded and
   estimated species richness and the estimated efficiency of further
   sampling can be easily computed with available freeware software and
   should be incorporated when performing biological inventories.}},

Abstract = {{Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are heavily dependent on marine prey, in
   particular ice-associated seals, which they hunt on landfast sea ice or
   free-floating pack ice. Dramatic current (and predicted) losses of sea
   ice habitat make it increasingly important to gain more knowledge of the
   relative use by bears of all types of prey from the marine food web as
   well as from terrestrial sources. This study uses frequency of
   occurrence of food items in 119 polar bear scats sampled on the sea ice
   as well as on shore in coastal areas in the Svalbard Archipelago, mainly
   in spring, between 2003 and 2010 to explore the diet of bears in the
   region. Ringed seals (Pusa hispida) occurred in 62.2 \% (CI 52.8-70.9
   \%) of the scat samples examined. Various terrestrial plants (32.8 \%,
   CI 24.4-42.0 \%) and marine algae (21.8 \%, CI 14.8-30.4 \%) also
   occurred frequently in the scats; the significance of this high
   occurrence of plants and algae is not clear. Bearded seals (Erignathus
   barbatus) and various bird species constituted only minor components of
   the diet, while Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus)
   occurred in 9.2 \% (CI 4.7-15.9 \%) of the scats, indicating that this
   species may play a more important role than previously reported. The
   novel combination of genetic analyses of material in the fecal samples
   along with detailed exploration of the physical-structural properties of
   prey hairs and plant parts provided a much fuller picture of the diet of
   polar bears than would have been possible from observational studies of
   polar bear predation behavior alone. This approach may provide an
   important tool for monitoring the responses of polar bears to ongoing
   ecosystem changes that will result from continued warming in the Arctic.}},

   cement plant, northern Estonia (59 degrees 30N, 26 degrees 32E), which
   has been continuously polluted last 140 years. Methods We sampled 20
   forest stands on sandy gleyic podzols at various distances from the
   pollution source, leeward and windward of prevailing winds. Data
   processing: principal components analysis for gradient generalization,
   indicator species analysis for grouping species along the pollution
   gradient and generalized linear model analyses to estimate species
   reaction to pollution, considering covariates. Results The impact of
   alkaline dust accumulated over a century persisted despite resolute
   reductions of pollution. Forest soil conditions changed 10km leeward and
   5km windward from the source: the litter pH level changed from 3.6 to
   4.5 in unpolluted forests to 7.17.4 in the heavily polluted forests, and
   soil Ca content increased ten-fold. Soil alkalization has induced a
   remarkable succession from typical boreal vegetation toward vegetation
   of boreo-nemoral or calcareous habitats. We detected a linear increase
   of species richness from habitats on acidic soils (unpolluted) to newly
   formed alkaline soils (polluted habitats), reflecting the species pool
   composition and size, which is known to be large for calcicolous
   species. The establishment of several endangered calcicolous species
   shows the lack of dispersal limitation and points on their narrow soil
   pH niche. The niche breadth of species along the pH gradient varied
   among species, but only a few species appeared to be pH generalists.
   Conclusions Species ranking along the pH and/or Ca gradients indicates
   (1) the existence of different ecological guilds in terms of ecological
   niche use, and (2) the formation of a new community is dictated by the
   tolerance level of each species. This supports the individualistic
   community assembly rule suggested by Gleason. We find that such polluted
   regions with disturbed communities have high scientific value as
   long-term ecological experiments, but this might lead to conflict
   between the peculiar biodiversity complex and human well-being.}},

   franciscanus within barrens less valuable to a fishery. We investigated
   the potential of kelp forest habitat restoration, which may be
   achievable primarily by removing S. purpuratus from barrens, to
   positively impact the local S. franciscanus fishery and offset the
   losses in fishing grounds within recently established MPAs in our study
   area. Generalized linear modeling of the relationship between gonad
   weight and length (test diameter) demonstrated clear size-specific
   differences in gonad production between urchins collected in barrens and
   kelp forests. These relationships varied over time, with the maximum
   observed mean gonad biomass at length being 484\% greater in kelp forest
   than barren habitat for S. franciscanus just above the legal size limit.
   The variability in S. franciscanus density (5.2 times greater in urchin
   barrens), size structure (mean test diameters were approximately 50\%
   greater in kelp forest) and gonad production were then incorporated
   using Monte Carlo simulations. Results indicated that restoration could
   potentially result in an 864\% increase in S. franciscanus gonad biomass
   available to the fishery, and a 132\% increase in reproductive potential
   per unit area of urchin barren restored to kelp forest. If all 36 ha of
   urchin barren habitat mapped outside of the new MPAs in the study area
   were restored, the increase in gonad biomass available to the fishery
   could potentially offset 52\% of which is now protected within the 109
   ha of rocky reef in the new MPAs. Kelp restoration has the potential to
   play a valuable role as one of many integrated tools in an
   ecosystem-based management approach.}},

Title = {{Chasing a moving target: projecting climate change-induced shifts in

Abstract = {{1. The geographic distributions of plant species show marked
   correlations with the current climate, suggesting that they are likely
   to shift if climate changes. However, before projecting any such shifts,
   it is important to establish whether distributions are at equilibrium
   with the current climate. If they are not, distributional shifts could
   occur even without climate change, making it difficult to tease apart
   climate-induced shifts from shifts occurring naturally without climate
   change.
   2. We forecast the geographical distributions of the 10 most common
   trees occurring in the Iberian Peninsula using a new method that relaxes
   the species-climate equilibrium assumption implicit in most species
   distributions models. For each species, we developed a spatially
   explicit patch occupancy model (SPOM) with climate-dependent extinction
   rates and with colonization rates that depend on both climate and local
   seed dispersal. Bayesian methods were used to estimate the colonization,
   extinction and seed dispersal functions against observed colonization
   and extinction events recorded in repeat surveys of 46 596 forest plots
   in the Spanish Forest Inventories (1986-96 and 1997-2007). We then
   simulated distributional changes between the years 2000-2100.
   3. Without climate change, 9 of the 10 species substantially increased
   in regional frequency. These increases occurred primarily within current
   ranges, although some species also expanded across their range edges.
   With climate change, one temperate conifer species and two
   sub-Mediterranean species would reduce their frequency of occurrence
   across the studied region, whereas temperate broad-leaved species were
   unaffected and Mediterranean species were either unaffected or increased
   their frequency of occurrence.
   4. Synthesis. The analysis suggests that these species are substantially
   out of equilibrium, such that abundances and ranges would increase
   without climate change. Climate change may increase, decrease, stabilize
   or shift distributions, in a way that can only be understood by
   comparing predictions against baseline scenarios that account for these
   non-equilibrium range dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{. 1.Physical structure and species composition of vegetation determine

   first time, the role of plant structure on spider communities in New
   Zealand native alpine tussock grasslands. We investigate the specific
   associations between spider assemblages and plant communities and test
   the hypothesis that spider diversity increases with plant diversity and
   tussock cover. 2.Spiders were sampled using density- and
   abundance-activity-dependent methods. Data on physical characteristics
   and species composition of plants revealed gradients in vegetation,
   driven by distinct intra-ecosystem plant communities. Effects of
   vegetation on spider diversity and composition were assessed through
   linear mixed-effects models. Redundancy analysis was used to determine
   and visualise the spider specieslevel response to gradients in plant
   compositions. 3.There was a positive relationship between plant
   diversity and spider diversity, while the effects of tussock cover
   varied with spider taxa. Overall, physical structure and species
   composition of vegetation had effects on the abundance of a similar
   number of spider species and families. 4.Gradients in vegetation were
   matched to gradients in spider communities, whose diversity and
   composition varied according to their habitat preference. The family
   Orsolobidae was associated with wetland vegetation, and Linyphiidae with
   shrubs. The abundance of certain spider families and species, such as
   Lycosidae and Anoteropsis hilaris, was consistently affected by
   vegetation. 5.Environmental factors, such as soil moisture, may affect
   plant species composition and physical structure in tussock grasslands,
   which in turn determine spider assemblages. Lycosidae were identified as
   potential indicators of structural changes in tussock grassland plants

Abstract = {{Improving our knowledge of pre-anthropogenic landscapes is vital for
   understanding landscape-scale heterogeneity and for setting goals and

   highly modified landscapes that contain few remnants of pre-impact
   ecosystems. This study aims to develop new methodology to improve
   understanding of historical vegetation, using the now-degraded inhabited
   highlands of the Galapagos Islands as a case study. Our
   multidisciplinary approach innovatively combines data from interviews
   with residents who were familiar with the vegetation before most
   degradation occurred with the more traditional sources of historical
   aerial photography and information from early explorer and scientist
   reports. We reconstruct historical vegetation across the landscape by
   mapping it in the year 1960 and discussing this map in the historical
   context of anthropogenic change. Our results confirm published
   vegetation types but also define some other types not previously
   described, and suggest much greater spatial, temporal and structural
   heterogeneity than commonly understood. This result can be used by
   Galapagos land managers to better match species assemblages with sites
   and plan restoration actions that will maximise resilience against the
   ongoing and future threats of climate change and species invasions. Our
   methodology can be applied in extensive areas of the world where the

Abstract = {{In the last few years, improved analytical tools and the integration of
   genetic data with multiple sources of information have shown that
   temperate species exhibited more complex responses to ice ages than
   previously thought. In this study, we investigated how Pleistocene
   climatic changes affected the current distribution and genetic diversity
   of European populations of the tick Ixodes ricinus, an ectoparasite with
   high ecological plasticity. We first used mitochondrial and nuclear
   genetic markers to investigate the phylogeographic structure of the
   species and its Pleistocene history using coalescent-based methods; then
   we used species distribution modelling to infer the climatic niche of
   the species at last glacial maximum; finally, we reviewed the literature
   on the I.ricinus hosts to identify the locations of their glacial
   refugia. Our results support the scenario that during the last glacial
   phase, I.ricinus never experienced a prolonged allopatric divergence in
   separate glacial refugia, but persisted with interconnected populations
   across Southern and Central Europe. The generalist behaviour in host
   choice of I.ricinus would have played a major role in maintaining
   connections between its populations. Although most of the hosts
   persisted in separate refugia, from the point of view of I.ricinus, they
   represented a continuity of bridges' among populations. Our study
   highlights the importance of species-specific ecology in affecting
   responses to Pleistocene glacialinterglacial cycles. Together with other
   cases in Europe and elsewhere, it contributes to setting new hypotheses
   on how species with wide ecological plasticity coped with Pleistocene

Abstract = {{The conservation of wild fisheries resources in the face of an
   ever-increasing world demand for seafood requires the use of a number of
   management tools, including no-take zones, and gear, species, and
   temporal restrictions. One way of enforcing some of these regulations is
   through the use of Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data that provides
   enforcement officers with the position of fishing vessels in the
   management area. The increasing volume of movement data collected using
   VMS calls for new methods that could help analysts extract useful
   knowledge from these large data sets. Various approaches have been
   proposed for visualizing and exploring movement data and detecting
   patterns within these data, but those approaches have generally not been
   tested in a real-world context or compared together, making their actual
   usability and utility unclear. This paper describes, compares, and
   assesses three such approaches in the context of fisheries enforcement:
   an existing system used for fisheries enforcement operations in Canada
   (VUE), a novel Hybrid Spatio-temporal Filtering (HSF) system developed
   by the authors, and an automated Behavioural Change Point Analysis
   (BCPA) system. A field trial was conducted with experienced fisheries
   enforcement officers to compare and contrast the benefits and drawbacks
   of the three approaches. While all three presented advantages and
   disadvantages, the interactivity of VUE and HSF were identified as
   desirable features, as they provide analysts with more control over the
   data, while allowing flexible data exploration. BCPA, while providing an
   automated approach to the data analysis, was pointed out as being too
   much of a ``black box{''}, causing unease among the experts who require
   a level of transparency similar to that of legally admissible evidence.
   In the end, the experts suggested that the best approach would be to
   merge the analytical power of their existing VUE system with the
   exploratory power of the HSF system. This study provides insight into
   the value of using interactive mapping and filtering approaches in
   support of data analysis in the context of fisheries enforcement.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Ecological indicators of fishing pressure in space are an important part
   of the Data Collection Framework (DCF) established by the European
   Commission in its attempt to apply an ecosystem approach to fisheries.
   These indicators are devised to use the information provided by the
   Vessel Monitoring System, a mandatory tool for EU fishing vessels which
   allows to record fishing activity in space and time. This study reports
   and analyzes trends of DCF fishing pressure indicators in the years
   2007-2010 for the Italian trawlers in seven Mediterranean geographic
   sub-areas and the related trends of landing per unit effort. In
   addition, new versions of these indicators are developed and their
   performances compared to the DCF ones by a simulation approach. The
   rationale for these new version of indicators is based on: (i) the
   development of a formal definition of ``fishing ground{''}, allowing for
   innovative statistical analyses of fishing patterns in space and time;
   (ii) the revision of issues affecting DCF indicators. Results provide:
   (i) the first extensive documentation of space use by fisheries through
   time; (ii) evidences of subtle yet significant changes in fishing
   pattern which, in agreement to other studies, indirectly support a
   decline of fisheries resources in the Mediterranean; (iii) improved
   versions of DCF fishing pressure indicators, obtained via the
   identification and analysis of fishing grounds and the assessment of
   aggregation by Gini's G index. The latter point could mark an important
   progress in order to overcome some critical weakness evidenced by DCF
   indicators. Moreover, the statistical identification and analysis of
   fishing grounds could represent a valuable insight in quantitative
   investigations of fisheries impacts and effects, even beyond indicators

Abstract = {{The impact of global changes on food security is of serious concern.
   Breeding novel crop cultivars adaptable to climate change is one
   potential solution, but this approach requires an understanding of
   complex adaptive traits for climate-change conditions. In this study,
   plant growth, nitrogen (N) uptake, and yield in relation to climatic
   resource use efficiency of nine representative maize cultivars released
   between 1973 and 2000 in China were investigated in a 2-year field
   experiment under three N applications. The Hybrid-Maize model was used
   to simulate maize yield potential in the period from 1973 to 2011.
   During the past four decades, the total thermal time (growing degree
   days) increased whereas the total precipitation and sunshine hours
   decreased. This climate change led to a reduction of maize potential
   yield by an average of 12.9\% across different hybrids. However, the
   potential yield of individual hybrids increased by 118.5 similar to kg
   similar to ha-1 similar to yr-1 with increasing year of release. From
   1973 to 2000, the use efficiency of sunshine hours, thermal time, and
   precipitation resources increased by 37\%, 40\%, and 41\%, respectively.
   The late developed hybrids showed less reduction in yield potential in
   current climate conditions than old cultivars, indicating some
   adaptation to new conditions. Since the mid-1990s, however, the yield
   impact of climate change exhibited little change, and even a slight
   worsening for new cultivars. Modern breeding increased ear fertility and
   grain-filling rate, and delayed leaf senescence without modification in
   net photosynthetic rate. The trade-off associated with delayed leaf
   senescence was decreased grain N concentration rather than increased
   plant N uptake, therefore N agronomic efficiency increased
   simultaneously. It is concluded that modern maize hybrids tolerate the
   climatic changes mainly by constitutively optimizing plant productivity.
   Maize breeding programs in the future should pay more attention to cope
   with the limiting climate factors specifically.}},

Abstract = {{Questions What is the relative importance of direct herbivory compared

   secondary forest (Betula celtiberica and Fagus sylvatica), Bizkaia,
   Northern Spain. Methods We conducted a detailed spatial analysis of 216
   permanent 1-m2 subplots that were distributed among six plots, of which
   three were fenced (each plot was 3600-m2) and three were unfenced (each
   plot was 1296-m2). Within each subplot, the emergence and survival rates
   of all tree, shrub and vine species were monitored. In total, 21
   censuses of the subplots were conducted across 4 yr (19982001). Ungulate
   abundance was measured by using the pellet counting method. Structural
   equation models were applied to model the entire recruitment process.
   Results Emergence and survival rates differed between small- and
   large-seeded species, and the effect of domestic ungulates (primarily
   sheep) on these rates depended on seed traits. Sheep did not affect the
   emergence of large-seeded species (e.g. beech and ivy), but did result
   in a decline in their survival. In contrast, the emergence of
   small-seeded species (e.g. birch) was promoted through an increase in
   bare soil cover because of trampling by the ungulates, but no
   significant effect on survival was observed. Interestingly, the sheep
   prompted differences in the role of the understorey vegetation: the
   understorey composition was able to promote the survival of large-seeded
   species growing in unfenced conditions by reducing the risk of herbivore
   predation, but had a negative effect on the survival of small-seeded
   species because of low light availability under the shaded shrub
   canopies. Conclusions Our results clearly highlight that sheep can
   change the seedling bank structure in a secondary temperate forest,
   thereby affecting the dynamics and structure of forest remnants. This
   impact should be included as a critical driver in current predictive
   models of forest dynamics in temperate regions, since herbivore pressure
   is increasing in forests across Europe due to an increase in wild
   ungulate populations and livestock.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new individual-based approach to model populations of
   largely inhomogeneous densities. By monitoring different populations at
   a spatial scale which is inversely proportional to the maximum expected
   concentration, the Scaled Subspaces Method solves the problem of
   demographic explosion of the most numerous species. It is intuitively
   similar to the experimental practice of changing the magnification of a
   microscope depending on the size-class of organisms inspected, and
   retains the possibility for uniform biological descriptions across
   scales. We use this method to simulate a pelagic microbial mixotrophic
   food web, where the most abundant species has population densities up to
   five orders of magnitude higher than the rarest species. The model
   generates biologically plausible and highly consistent predictions of
   biomass distribution across this density spectrum. Individual-based
   community models are affected by the possibility of artificial
   extinctions. We discuss theoretically and confirm experimentally this
   possibility, and show that this problem can be overcome through the use
   of large populations, genetic mutations, and periodical random
   reintroduction of lost species or traits. We also show that the proposed
   individual-based model produces the same solutions as a state-variable
   model of the same ecological scenario. This indicates that the
   predictions of the two models are independent of implementation issues,
   and allows using them interchangeably according to convenience. Overall,
   the study proves the viability of the Scaled Subspaces Method, and
   provides useful insights on its functioning and parameterization. (C)

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{250}},
Pages = {{287-293}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{The maximum entropy production principle (MEPP) is an important and
   growing area of research with significant implications for many fields
   of study, including ecology. Thermodynamically, an ecosystem operates in
   such a way as to maximize entropic production, in accordance with the
   second law of thermodynamics. This paper presents a general model of the
   observed changes in entropic production during ecological succession,
   beginning with emerging evidence that the climax community represents a
   state of maximum entropy production. We then examine the outcome of this
   model, which provides a new insight into the driving process, direction
   and seral progression observed in succession. We suggest that succession
   moves towards an energetic rather than a structural climax, which
   represents a dynamic rather than a static state. Using the maximum
   entropy production principle, we propose that entropic generation across
   a succession follows a logistic model, initially undergoing rapid
   increase in entropy production, before approaching an asymptote, called
   S-max. The underlying changes in entropy production are suggested to
   control seral change. This is in agreement with a growing body of
   literature, and provides a framework for a new understanding of
   succession. These findings also have significant implications for
   assessing anthropological impacts on ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{We present here and in the companion papers an analysis of
   sustainability in the Middle Rio Grande region of the U.S.-Mexico border
   and propose an interdisciplinary research agenda focused on the coupled
   human and natural dimensions of water resources sustainability in the
   face of climate and social change in an international border region. Key
   threats to water sustainability in the Middle Rio Grande River region
   include: (1) increasing salinization of surface and ground water, (2)
   increasing water demand from a growing population in the El Paso/Ciudad
   Juarez area on top of an already high base demand from irrigated
   agriculture, (3) water quality impacts from agricultural, municipal, and
   industrial discharges to the river, (4) changing regional climate that
   portends increased frequency and intensity of droughts interspersed with
   more intensive rainfall and flooding events, and (5) disparate water
   planning and management systems between different states in the U. S.
   and between the U. S. and Mexico. In addition to these challenges, there
   is an increasing demand from a significant regional population who is
   (and has been historically) underserved in terms of access to affordable
   potable water. To address these challenges to water resources
   sustainability, we have focused on: (1) the determinants of resilience
   and transformability in an ecological/social setting on an international
   border and how they can be measured and predicted; and (2) the drivers
   of change ... what are they (climate, social, etc.) and how are they
   impacting the coupled human and natural dimensions of water
   sustainability on the border? To tackle these challenges, we propose a
   research agenda based on a complex systems approach that focuses on the
   linkages and feedbacks of the natural, built/managed, and social
   dimensions of the surface and groundwater budget of the region. The
   approach that we propose incorporates elements of systems analysis,
   complexity science, and the use of modeling tools such as scenario
   planning and back-casting to link the quantitative with the qualitative.
   This approach is unique for our region, as are our bi-national focus and
   our conceptualization of ``water capital''. In particular, the concept
   of water capital provides the basis for a new interdisciplinary paradigm
   that integrates social, economic, and natural sectors within a systems
   framework in order to understand and characterize water resources
   sustainability. This proposed approach would not only provide a
   framework for water sustainability decision making for our bi-national
   region at the local, state, and federal levels, but could serve as a
   model for similar border regions and/or international rivers in arid and
   semi-arid regions in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Latin America.}},

Volume = {{158}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Active and dynamic management of biodiversity is of utmost importance in
   the face of increasing human pressures on nature. Current approaches for
   site selection of protected areas often assume that both conservation
   features and management actions are fixed in space and time. However,
   this approach should be revised to allow for spatio-temporal shifts of
   biodiversity features, threats and management options. Our aim here was
   to demonstrate a novel approach for systematic conservation planning at
   a fine scale that incorporates dynamic ecological processes (e.g.,
   succession), biodiversity targets and management costs. We used the new
   `Marxan with Zones' decision support tool to spatially redistribute the
   major structural types of vegetation within a privately-owned nature
   park in Israel and facilitate the achievement of multiple conservation
   targets for minimum cost. The park is located in the Mediterranean
   climate region of the eastern Mediterranean Basin, one of Earth's
   richest biodiversity hotspots. This small park alone (4.5 km(2)) holds
   660 species of native plants and six structural types of vegetation. The
   region has been subject to manifold human pressures such as grazing,
   clearing and fire for millennia and is currently threatened by a range
   of modern human-related activities (e.g., invasive alien species). By
   spatially redistributing the six structural vegetation types under three
   scenarios, representing different conservation objectives (no change,
   equal distribution - evenness of structural types, preference to early
   succession stages) within three budget frameworks, we identified a set
   of near-optimal conservation strategies that can be enacted over time.
   The current spatial distribution of structural types and the cost of
   changing one structural type into another via management actions had a
   major impact on the spatial prioritization outcomes and management
   recommendations. Notably, an advanced successional stage (dense
   Mediterranean garrigue) tended to dominate a large portion of the
   landscape when the available budgets were low because it is a relatively
   inexpensive structural type to maintain. The approach presented here can
   be further applied to spatially prioritize conservation goals in the
   face of shifting environments and climates, allowing dynamic
   conservation planning at multiple spatial scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{274-284}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The paper demonstrates how ecosystem services can be viewed and studied
   as a social practice of value articulation. With this follows that when
   ecosystem services appear as objects of calculated value in
   decision-making they are already tainted by the social and cannot be
   viewed as merely reflecting an objective biophysical reality. Using
   urban case studies of place-based struggles in Stockholm and Cape Town,
   we demonstrate how values are relationally constructed through social
   practice. The same analysis is applied on ecosystem services. Of special
   interest is the TEEB Manual that uses a consultancy report on the
   economic evaluation of Cape Town's `natural assets' to describe a
   step-by-step method to catalog, quantify and price certain aspects of
   urban nature. The Manual strives to turn the ecosystem services approach
   into a transportable method, capable of objectively measuring the values
   of urban nature everywhere, in all cities in the world. With its gesture
   of being universal and objective, the article suggests that the
   ecosystem services approach is a technology of globalization that
   de-historicizes and de-ecologizes debates on urbanized ecologies,
   effectively silencing other and often marginalized ways of knowing and
   valuing. The paper inscribes ecosystem services as social practice, as
   part of historical process, and as inherently political. A call is made
   for critical ethnographies of how ecosystem services and urban

Abstract = {{There has been a dramatic shift in dominance from Stipa grandis
   communities to S. krylovii communities in the Inner Mongolia steppe of
   China, in recent decades due to climate change and human activity. We
   examined the growth and carbohydrate allocation pattern of S. grandis
   and S. krylovii under controlled conditions. The experimental approach
   involved a drought stress treatment and a simulated defoliation
   (clipping) treatment of both species. Growth (above ground biomass and
   root biomass) and carbon allocation (concentration of leaf total
   phenolics and pool of total non-structural carbohydrate) variables were
   evaluated at the end of the experiment. Responses to drought stress
   differed significantly between S. grandis and S. krylovii. For S.
   krylovii, growth and the pool of total non-structural carbohydrate were
   more negatively affected by drought stress, whereas concentration of
   total phenolics was positively affected. Drought stress reinforced
   responses to defoliation, and drought stress x defoliation interaction
   was significant for all of the variables. There was a distinct
   defoliation response level for growth after drought stress between the
   two species. For aboveground biomass, both species responded positively
   to drought stress, which changed from responses equivalence to S.
   krylovii being superior; for root biomass, the two species responded
   oppositely to drought stress, which changed from S. grandis being
   superior to S. krylovii being superior. There was a weak and reverse
   defoliation response level for the carbon allocation pattern after
   drought stress between the two species, with S. krylovii changing from
   superior in defense to superior in storage. These results suggested that
   S. grandis utilized an avoidance strategy (investment in defense
   compounds) and S. krylovii utilized a tolerance strategy (investment in
   storage for regrowth) in response to defoliation under drought stress,
   supporting the idea that stress-tolerant species may become the new
   dominant species because of their ability to re-grow after disturbance.
   This provided a possible explanation for the replacement of S. grandis
   communities from the view point of adaptive strategy.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{65-76}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The increasing degradation of marine ecosystems as a result of
   increasing impact caused by anthropogenic pressures, urges for
   well-founded knowledge to develop efficient tools to appraise the
   quality status of fish assemblages, as required by the ``Marine Strategy
   Framework Directive{''}. This study analyzed the structural and
   functional response of rocky fish assemblages to several pressures on
   the Portuguese coast, i.e. fishing, sewage discharges, port activities
   and thermal effluent, by selecting fish-based metrics that best
   distinguished disturbed from control areas. One of the novel aspects of
   this research is the integrated assessment made through the analysis of
   several metrics representing numerous attributes of fish assemblages
   (namely diversity, abundance, trophic structure, mobility, resilience,
   habitat association, nursery function), which contrasts with the most
   commonly used approaches that in general focus on fish species/families.
   PERMANOVA results showed significant differences on metrics composition
   for all pressures with the exception of the thermal effluent. Moreover,
   two major patterns of stress were identified: (1) selective pressure,
   which affects differentially the fish assemblages (fishing): (2)
   broad-range pressure, which affects the entire fish assemblage with
   metrics of several attributes (e.g. structure, resilience, trophic
   guilds, nursery function) responding to its presence (sewage discharges,
   port activities). Taking into account the sensitivity results
   (discriminant analysis and Mann-Whitney test), biological meaning and
   redundancy with other metrics (Spearman correlations), the following
   metrics were selected as the most suitable to detect changes on
   temperate reef fish assemblages: ``density of generalist
   individuals{''}, ``density of territorial individuals{''}, ``density of
   large individuals with medium to high commercial value (>20 cm){''}.
   ``density of juveniles{''} and metrics relative to trophic guild (except
   zoo-planktivores). Since metrics grouped species that have some degree
   of functional overlap, the present approach was useful to understand
   human-induced changes at the assemblage level, contributing for the
   future use of marine fishes as biological indicators. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{420-430}},

Abstract = {{Global climate warming is predicted to lead to global and regional
   changes in the distribution of organisms. One influential approach to
   test this prediction using temporally repeated mapping surveys of
   organisms was suggested in a seminal paper by Thomas \& Lennon (1999,
   Nature). The Thomas \& Lennon approach corrects observed changes in the
   range margin for changes in the range size, and thus potentially
   controls for other broad-scale environmental changes between surveys,
   however the approach does not necessarily account for potential biases
   in sampling effort. To verify whether the issue of variation in sampling
   effort affects empirical estimates of shifts in range margin, we
   reanalyzed all three published studies exploring range margin changes of
   breeding birds in Great Britain (GB), Finland, and New York State (NY).
   Accounting for changes in survey effort on range margins lowered the
   estimated shift for breeding birds in New York, but the shift remained
   statistically significant. For Great Britain and Finland, for which no
   direct estimate of survey effort is available, we used species richness
   (a strong correlate of survey effort in New York) as a proxy and found
   that in both cases the estimated shift in range margin was significantly
   reduced and became nonsignificant. To understand how robust the approach
   is to sampling biases, we use a simulation model to show that the Thomas
   \& Lennon approach is, under certain conditions, sensitive to changes in
   detection probability (probability to detect true occupancy) which in
   turn may be affected by changes in surveying effort between surveys. We
   thus found evidence that temporal changes in the distribution of
   breeding birds based on repeated mapping surveys may be inflated by
   changes in survey effort along range boundaries. We discuss possible
   approaches to deal with this issue in the analysis and design of
   national or regional surveys.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms by which algae disperse across space on coral reefs are
   poorly known. We investigated the ability of four common Caribbean
   herbivorous fish species to disperse viable algal fragments through
   consumption of macroalgae and subsequent defecation. Fragments of all
   major algal taxa (Phaeophyta, Rhodophyta, and Chlorophyta) were found in
   98.7 \% of the fecal droppings of all fish species; however, the ability
   to survive gut passage and reattach to a substrate differed between
   algal taxa. While survival and reattachment approached zero for
   Phaeophyta and Chlorophyta, 76.4 \% of the fragments belonging to the
   group Rhodophyta (mostly species in the order Gelidiaceae) survived gut
   passage, and were able to grow and reattach to the substrate by forming
   new rhizoids. Our results thus show that Gelidid algal species are
   dispersed by swimming herbivores. While the relative contribution of
   this mechanism to overall algal dispersal and recruitment in a wider
   ecological context remains unknown, our findings illustrate a previously
   undescribed mechanism of algal dispersal on coral reefs which is

Title = {{Protecting Biodiversity Through Strategic Alien Plant Management: An
   Approach for Increasing Conservation Outcomes in Protected Areas}},

Pages = {{507-528}},
Abstract = {{Despite wide acknowledgement of the significant threat posed by invasive
   alien plants to biodiversity, management strategies have not yet
   adequately addressed the problem. Among the reasons for this are the
   lack of knowledge of the biodiversity at risk from invasive alien
   plants, an emphasis on control rather than the outcome of such control
   actions, ineffective monitoring programmes, a lack of resources,
   institutional barriers to change, and mismatches between policy and
   management. To resolve this situation, strategies for managing invasive
   alien plants need to focus on specific biodiversity conservation
   outcomes and put in place a range of measures to ensure that the aims
   are achieved. One area where such a change would have significant
   conservation outcomes is the management of invasive alien plants in
   protected areas, given the threat posed to high-value biodiversity. Such
   a system would also enable conservation outcomes to be reported on. The
   lack of outcome reporting has been highlighted as a significant problem
   in numerous studies, including the recent assessment of progress towards
   the Convention of Biological Diversity targets. Here I present an
   overview of one approach that has been developed to ensure that invasive
   alien plant management delivers desired conservation outcomes. To
   achieve this, each step in the planning and management process was
   evaluated and modified to ensure that it could deliver the desired
   outcome. The potential application of this approach within protected
   areas to improve the management of invasive alien plants and increase
   the protection of biodiversity is discussed. Adoption of these processes
   by managers of protected areas will have long lasting benefits for both
   invasive alien plant control and biodiversity conservation as it
   prioritises management to areas where control is likely to have the
   greatest outcomes; something that is critical given the lack of
   resources currently available to manage invasive alien plants in many
   protected areas across the globe.}},

Title = {{Distribution, habitat preferences and management of the yellow-bellied
   glider, Petaurus australis, on the Bago Plateau, New South Wales: a
   reassessment of the population and its status}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{599-614}},
Abstract = {{Context. A population of yellow-bellied glider on the Bago Plateau, near
   Tumbarumba, was listed as an Endangered Population in 2008 under
   theNewSouth Wales (NSW) Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The
   listing was based on limited data that suggested that the population is
   geographically and genetically distinct and its habitat in decline.
   Aims. To review the validity of the endangered-population listing
   following the collection of new data on its distribution, habitat
   preferences and responses to logging.
   Methods. Surveys for the yellow-bellied glider were conducted at a
   subset of sites established in 1995 on the Bago Plateau as well as
   across parts of the neighbouring Kosciuszko National Park, which had not
   been surveyed previously. The distribution of suitable habitat
   throughout these areas was evaluated.
   Key results. The yellow-bellied glider was recorded at 29\% of 48 sites
   resurveyed in 2010, 54\% of which were previously occupied in 1995. Most
   changes in glider occupancy occurred at sites that had not been logged
   during the intervening period. The gliders preferred forest types
   dominated by montane gums (Eucalyptus dalrympleana, E. viminalis, E.
   camphora, E. pauciflora and E. stellulata) and used forest types of
   montane gums mixed with E. robertsonii or E. delegatensis in proportion
   to their availability across the landscape. The gliders were not
   observed to use monospecific stands of E. delegatensis. The
   yellow-bellied glider was also recorded frequently in Kosciuszko
   National Park. E. dalrympleana was consistently represented in the
   distribution of this species across the NSW Snowy Mountains.
   Conclusions. Yellow-bellied glider site occupancy was not related to
   timber harvesting. Its habitat was not restricted by elevation or
   confined within Bago and Maragle State Forests by the Tumut River Gorge,
   Blowering and Talbingo Dams, as previously thought. We estimated that
   there is a large population of the gliders occupying up to 440 000 ha of
   contiguous habitat across the broader Snowy Mountains region of NSW,
   extending also into ACT and Victoria.
   Implications. The listing of the Bago Plateau portion of this population
   as an endangered population appears inconsistent with relevant listing
   criteria and requires review.}},

Title = {{Captive husbandry and veterinary care of northern New Zealand dotterels
   (Charadrius obscurus aquilonius) during the CV Rena oil-spill response}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{624-632}},
Abstract = {{Context. Oil spills cause significant detrimental impacts on many
   shoreline species. There is limited information in the scientific
   literature about the management and response of shorebirds to oil
   spills. Northern New Zealand dotterels (Charadrius obscurus aquilonius)
   were pre-emptively captured as part of the oiled wildlife response to
   the container vessel Rena oil spill, to ensure the survival of a
   regional population should there be a catastrophic release of oil.
   Previous attempts to hold dotterels in captivity have resulted in high
   mortality.
   Aims. To describe the captive husbandry and veterinary management of
   wild-caught adult dotterels, to outline the common problems encountered,
   and make recommendations for future captive management.
   Methods. The dotterels were caught by noose mat on beaches at risk of
   further contamination by oil. Initially, dotterels were kept
   individually indoors and force-fed until they converted to self-feeding
   on a diet of an artificial insect analogue, ox heart and mealworms. Once
   self-feeding, the birds were shifted to individual outdoor aviaries.
   Key results. Sixty dotterels were caught. About half of birds had oil
   contamination of the legs, nine birds had light oil staining of feathers
   and only three of these birds required washing. The degree of oiling and
   washing did not affect survival. Dotterels took a median of 5 days
   (range 1-15 days) to convert to the captive diet. Common problems
   encountered in captivity included carpal and beak abrasions (61.7\%) and
   pododermatitis (75\%); however, these did not affect survival. Seven
   birds (11.7\%) developed respiratory disease and six of these died from
   aspergillosis. The incidence of aspergillosis increased with length of
   time in captivity and was largely refractory to treatment. The 54
   surviving birds were released at their capture sites after a median time
   of 49 days in captivity (with a range of 39-61 days).
   Conclusions. The captive management of the dotterels achieved a 90\%
   survival rate over a period of about 2 months. Deaths were solely due to
   respiratory aspergillosis, but intensive captive husbandry was required
   to convert the birds to a captive diet, to minimise traumatic injuries
   and to manage pododermatitis.
   Implications. Although the captive management of shorebird species as a
   pre-emptive strategy to minimise the effects of oil spills carries
   significant costs and risks to the birds, it should be considered in the
   emergency management of high-priority species.}},

Abstract = {{New Zealand's 1.72 million hectares of planted forests constitute a
   productive ecosystem mainly recognised for the provision of wood and
   fibre. This ecosystem is increasingly being recognised for providing
   other services such as recreation, climate change mitigation, habitat
   provision, improved water quality, bioenergy, erosion control, and flood
   mitigation. This chapter describes several ecosystem services provided
   by planted forests and reports some of the estimated economic values for
   these services. Findings from this study suggest that the estimated
   economic values for emerging services, such as recreation and
   biodiversity, remain very limited and in many cases out of date. More

Title = {{EROSION PROCESSES AND THEIR CONTROL IN NEW ZEALAND}},
Booktitle = {{ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN NEW ZEALAND: CONDITIONS AND TRENDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Pages = {{363-374}},
Abstract = {{Erosion control is an important regulating ecosystem service in New
   Zealand because of the diversity and extent of erosion processes.
   Erosion rates in New Zealand are naturally very high by world standards
   as a consequence of the dominance of steep slopes, erodible rocks,
   generally high rainfall and common high-intensity rainstorms. Recent and
   extensive deforestation and the introduction of large numbers of grazing
   animals have increased erosion rates. The most widespread and active
   type of erosion is rainfall-triggered shallow landslides, but other mass
   movements (earthflows and slumps), gully, surface (sheet, rill, wind)
   and streambank erosion are locally significant. Temporal trends in
   erosion in New Zealand are poorly known because there is no
   comprehensive monitoring programme and many of the widespread types of
   erosion, such as shallow landslides, are triggered by storm events that
   have high temporal variability. Biological methods of erosion control
   are by far the most widely used, with structural methods used locally
   for earthworks and bank erosion. Although a large range of vegetation
   types and species have been used to control erosion, space-planted
   poplars and willows have been the most widely used soil conservation
   plants in New Zealand since they can be established as poles in the
   presence of grazing animals, and are appropriate for the control of
   landslide, earthflow, gully and streambank erosion. Afforestation is
   also used for erosion control in the worst eroding areas. Closed-canopy
   tall woody vegetation typically reduces landsliding in large storms by
   70-90\%. Space-planted trees can reduce landsliding by a similar amount
   so long as the tree establishment/survival is adequate. Trees have also
   been shown to reduce rates of earthflow movement and gully erosion.
   Maintaining good ground cover is the key to reducing rates of sheet,
   rill and wind erosion. Few studies have assessed the value of erosion
   control in an ecosystem services context, and most of the available
   research focuses on the value of afforestation with little information
   on other erosion control technologies. Forests have significant benefits
   for erosion control and carbon storage, but reduction in water yield
   neutralises these benefits in water-short areas. Afforestation affects
   other ecosystem services by improving water quality and aquatic habitat,
   reducing greenhouse gases by sequestering carbon and nitrogen,
   protecting biodiversity, and contributing to soil and nutrient
   retention.}},

Abstract = {{An ecosystem approach to understanding the effects of biological
   invaders and pests can shed new light on the state of ecosystem services

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Successional phases describe changes in ecological communities that
   proceed in steps rather than continuously. Despite their importance for
   the understanding of ecosystem development, there still exists no
   reliable definition of phases and no quantitative measure of phase
   transitions. In order to obtain these data, we investigated primary
   succession in an artificial catchment (6 ha) in eastern Germany over a
   period of 6 years. The data set consists of records of plant species and
   their cover values, and initial substrate properties, both from plots in
   a regular grid (20 m x 20 m) suitable for spatial data analysis.
   Community assembly was studied by analyses of species co-occurrence and
   nestedness. Additionally, we correlated lognormal and log series
   distributions of species abundance to each community. We here introduce
   a new general method for detection of successional phases based on the
   degree of transient spatial homogeneity in the study system. Spatially
   coherent vegetation patterns revealed non-overlapping partitions within
   this sequence of primary succession and were characterized as two
   distinct ecological phases. Patterns of species co-occurrence were
   increasingly less random, and hence the importance of demographic
   stochasticity and neutral community assembly decreased during the study
   period. Our findings highlight the spatial dimension of successional
   phases and quantify the degree of change between these steps. They are
   an element for advancing a more reliable terminology of ecological
   successions.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the potential of trait-based parameters of taxa for linking
   above- and below-ground ecological networks (hereafter `green' and
   `brown' worlds) to understand and predict community dynamics. This
   synthesis considers carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus-related traits, the
   abundance of component species and their size distribution across
   trophic levels under different forms of management. We have analysed
   existing and novel databases on plants, microbes and invertebrates that
   combine physico-chemical and biological information from
   (agro)ecosystems spanning the globe. We found (1) evidence that traits
   from above- and below-ground systems may be integrated in the same model
   and (2) a much greater than expected stoichiometric plasticity of plants
   and microbes which has implications for the entire food-web mass
   abundance scaling. Nitrogen and phosphorus are primary basal resources
   (hence, drivers) and more retranslocation of P than of N from leaves
   will lead to higher N:P in the litter and soil organic matter. Thus,
   under nutrient-rich conditions, higher foliar concentrations of N and P
   are reflected by lower N:P in the brown litter, suggesting less P
   retranslocated than N. This apparent stoichiometric dichotomy between
   green and brown could result in shifts in threshold elemental ratios
   critical for ecosystem functioning. It has important implications for a
   general food-web model, given that resource C:N:P ratios are generally
   assumed to reflect environmental C:N:P ratios. We also provide the first
   evidence for large-scale allometric changes according to the
   stoichiometry of agroecosystems. Finally, we discuss insights that can
   be gained from integrating carbon and nitrogen isotope data into
   trait-based approaches, and address the origin of changes in Delta C-13
   and Delta N-15 fractionation values in relation to consumer-resource
   body-mass ratios.}},

Abstract = {{The resilience of small-scale fisheries in developed and developing
   countries has been used to provide lessons to conventional managers
   regarding ways to transition toward a social-ecological approach to
   understanding and managing fisheries. We contribute to the understanding
   of the relationship between management and the resilience of small-scale
   fisheries in developed countries by looking at these dynamics in the
   wake of the shock of stock collapse and fisheries closures in two
   contexts: Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and northern Norway. We
   revisit and update previous research on the gendered effects of the
   collapse and closure of the Newfoundland and Labrador northern cod
   fishery and the closure of the Norwegian cod fishery in the early 1990s
   and present new research on young people in fisheries communities in
   both contexts. We argue that post-closure fishery policy and industry
   responses that focused on downsizing fisheries through
   professionalization, the introduction of quotas, and other changes
   ignored the gendered and intergenerational household basis of
   small-scale fisheries and its relationship to resilience. Data on
   ongoing gender inequities within these fisheries and on largely failed
   recruitment of youth to these fisheries suggest they are currently at a
   tipping-point that, if not addressed, could lead to their virtual

Title = {{Do Adaptive Comanagement Processes Lead to Adaptive Comanagement
   Outcomes? A Multicase Study of Long-term Outcomes Associated with the
   National Riparian Service Team's Place-based Riparian Assistance}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Adaptive comanagement (ACM) is a novel approach to environmental
   governance that combines the dynamic learning features of adaptive
   management with the linking and network features of collaborative
   management. There is growing interest in the potential for ACM to
   resolve conflicts around natural resource management and contribute to
   greater social and ecological resilience, but little is known about how
   to catalyze long lasting ACM arrangements. We contribute to knowledge on
   this topic by evaluating the National Riparian Service Team's (NRST)
   efforts to catalyze ACM of public lands riparian areas in seven cases in
   the western U. S. We found that the NRST's approach offers a relatively
   novel model for integrating joint fact-finding, multiple forms of
   knowledge, and collaborative problem solving to improve public lands
   riparian grazing management. With this approach, learning and dialogue
   often helped facilitate the development of shared understanding and
   trust, key features of ACM. Their activities also influenced changes in
   assessment, monitoring, and management approaches to public lands
   riparian area grazing, also indicative of a transition to ACM. Whereas
   these effects often aligned with the NRST's immediate objectives, i.e.,
   to work through a specific issue or point of conflict, there was little
   evidence of long-term effects beyond the specific issue or intervention;
   that is, in most cases the initiative did not influence longer term
   changes in place-based governance and institutions. Our results suggest
   that the success of interventions aimed at catalyzing the transformation
   of governance arrangements toward ACM may hinge on factors external to
   the collaborative process such as the presence or absence of (1) dynamic
   local leadership and (2) high quality agreements regarding next steps
   for the group. Efforts to establish long lasting ACM institutions may
   also face significant constraints and barriers, including existing laws
   and regulations associated with public land management.}},

Abstract = {{Since the advancement in CH4 gas analyser technology and its
   applicability to eddy covariance flux measurements, monitoring of CH4
   emissions is becoming more widespread. In order to accurately determine
   the greenhouse gas balance, high quality gap-free data is required.
   Currently there is still no consensus on CH4 gap-filling methods, and
   methods applied are still study-dependent and often carried out on low
   resolution, daily data.
   In the current study, we applied artificial neural networks to six
   distinctively different CH4 time series from high latitudes, explain the
   method and test its functionality. We discuss the applicability of
   neural networks in CH4 flux studies, the advantages and disadvantages of
   this method, and what information we were able to extract from such
   models.
   Three different approaches were tested by including drivers such as air
   and soil temperature, barometric air pressure, solar radiation, wind
   direction (indicator of source location) and in addition the lagged
   effect of water table depth and precipitation. In keeping with the
   principle of parsimony, we included up to five of these variables
   traditionally measured at CH4 flux measurement sites. Fuzzy sets were
   included representing the seasonal change and time of day. High Pearson
   correlation coefficients (r) of up to 0.97 achieved in the final
   analysis are indicative for the high performance of neural networks and
   their applicability as a gap-filling method for CH4 flux data time
   series. This novel approach which we show to be appropriate for CH4
   fluxes is a step towards standardising CH4 gap-filling protocols.}},

Title = {{Simulating boreal forest carbon dynamics after stand-replacing fire
   disturbance: insights from a global process-based vegetation model}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{Stand-replacing fires are the dominant fire type in North American
   boreal forests. They leave a historical legacy of a mosaic landscape of
   different aged forest cohorts. This forest age dynamics must be included
   in vegetation models to accurately quantify the role of fire in the
   historical and current regional forest carbon balance. The present study
   adapted the global process-based vegetation model ORCHIDEE to simulate
   the CO2 emissions from boreal forest fire and the subsequent recovery
   after a stand-replacing fire; the model represents postfire new cohort
   establishment, forest stand structure and the self-thinning process.
   Simulation results are evaluated against observations of three clusters
   of postfire forest chronosequences in Canada and Alaska. The variables
   evaluated include: fire carbon emissions, CO2 fluxes (gross primary
   production, total ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem exchange),
   leaf area index, and biometric measurements (aboveground biomass carbon,
   forest floor carbon, woody debris carbon, stand individual density,
   stand basal area, and mean diameter at breast height). When forced by
   local climate and the atmospheric CO2 history at each chronosequence
   site, the model simulations generally match the observed CO2 fluxes and
   carbon stock data well, with model-measurement mean square root of
   deviation comparable with the measurement accuracy (for CO2 flux similar
   to 100 g C m(-2) yr(-1), for biomass carbon similar to 1000 g C m(-2)
   and for soil carbon similar to 2000 g C m(-2)). We find that the current
   postfire forest carbon sink at the evaluation sites, as observed by
   chronosequence methods, is mainly due to a combination of historical CO2
   increase and forest succession. Climate change and variability during
   this period offsets some of these expected carbon gains. The negative
   impacts of climate were a likely consequence of increasing water stress
   caused by significant temperature increases that were not matched by
   concurrent increases in precipitation. Our simulation results
   demonstrate that a global vegetation model such as ORCHIDEE is able to
   capture the essential ecosystem processes in fire-disturbed boreal
   forests and produces satisfactory results in terms of both carbon fluxes
   and carbon-stock evolution after fire. This makes the model suitable for
   regional simulations in boreal regions where fire regimes play a key
   role in the ecosystem carbon balance.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Earth system models (ESMs) are increasing in complexity by incorporating
   more processes than their predecessors, making them potentially
   important tools for studying the evolution of climate and associated
   biogeochemical cycles. However, their coupled behaviour has only
   recently been examined in any detail, and has yielded a very wide range
   of outcomes. For example, coupled climate-carbon cycle models that
   represent land-use change simulate total land carbon stores at 2100 that
   vary by as much as 600 Pg C, given the same emissions scenario. This
   large uncertainty is associated with differences in how key processes
   are simulated in different models, and illustrates the necessity of
   determining which models are most realistic using rigorous methods of
   model evaluation. Here we assess the state-of-the-art in evaluation of
   ESMs, with a particular emphasis on the simulation of the carbon cycle
   and associated biospheric processes. We examine some of the new advances
   and remaining uncertainties relating to (i) modern and palaeodata and
   (ii) metrics for evaluation. We note that the practice of averaging
   results from many models is unreliable and no substitute for proper
   evaluation of individual models. We discuss a range of strategies, such
   as the inclusion of pre-calibration, combined process- and system-level
   evaluation, and the use of emergent constraints, that can contribute to
   the development of more robust evaluation schemes. An increasingly
   data-rich environment offers more opportunities for model evaluation,
   but also presents a challenge. Improved knowledge of data uncertainties
   is still necessary to move the field of ESM evaluation away from a
   ``beauty contest{''} towards the development of useful constraints on
   model outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling and monitoring plankton functional types (PFTs) is challenged
   by the insufficient amount of field measurements of ground truths in
   both plankton models and bio-optical algorithms. In this study, we
   combine remote sensing data and a dynamic plankton model to simulate an
   ecologically sound spatial and temporal distribution of phyto-PFTs. We
   apply an innovative ecological indicator approach to modeling PFTs and
   focus on resolving the question of diatom-coccolithophore coexistence in
   the subpolar high-nitrate and low-chlorophyll regions. We choose an
   artificial neural network as our modeling framework because it has the
   potential to interpret complex nonlinear interactions governing complex
   adaptive systems, of which marine ecosystems are a prime example. Using
   ecological indicators that fulfill the criteria of measurability,
   sensitivity and specificity, we demonstrate that our diagnostic model
   correctly interprets some basic ecological rules similar to ones
   emerging from dynamic models. Our time series highlight a dynamic
   phyto-PFT community composition in all high-latitude areas and indicate
   seasonal coexistence of diatoms and coccolithophores. This observation,
   though consistent with in situ and remote sensing measurements, has so
   far not been captured by state-of-the-art dynamic models, which struggle
   to resolve this ``paradox of the plankton{''}. We conclude that an
   ecological indicator approach is useful for ecological modeling of
   phytoplankton and potentially higher trophic levels. Finally, we
   speculate that it could serve as a powerful tool in advancing
   ecosystem-based management of marine resources.}},

Title = {{A neural network-based estimate of the seasonal to inter-annual
   variability of the Atlantic Ocean carbon sink}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{7793-7815}},
Abstract = {{The Atlantic Ocean is one of the most important sinks for atmospheric
   carbon dioxide (CO2), but this sink has been shown to vary substantially
   in time. Here we use surface ocean CO2 observations to estimate this
   sink and the temporal variability from 1998 through 2007 in the Atlantic
   Ocean. We benefit from (i) a continuous improvement of the observations,
   i. e. the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) v1.5 database and (ii) a newly
   developed technique to interpolate the observations in space and time.
   In particular, we use a two-step neural network approach to reconstruct
   basin-wide monthly maps of the sea surface partial pressure of CO2
   (pCO(2)) at a resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees From those, we compute
   the air-sea CO2 flux maps using a standard gas exchange parameterization
   and high-resolution wind speeds. The neural networks fit the observed
   pCO(2) data with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 10 mu atm and
   with almost no bias. A check against independent time-series data and
   new data from SOCAT v2 reveals a larger RMSE of 22.8 mu atm for the
   entire Atlantic Ocean, which decreases to 16.3 mu atm for data south of
   40 degrees N. We estimate a decadal mean uptake flux of -0.45 +/- 0.15
   PgC yr(-1) for the Atlantic between 44 ffi S and 79 ffi N, representing
   the sum of a strong uptake north of 18 degrees N (-0.39 +/- 0.10 PgC
   yr(-1)), outgassing in the tropics (18 degrees S-18 degrees N, 0.11 +/-
   0.07 PgC yr(-1)), and uptake in the subtropical/temperate South Atlantic
   south of 18 degrees S (-0.16 +/- 0.06 PgC yr(-1)), consistent with
   recent studies. The strongest seasonal variability of the CO2 flux
   occurs in the temperature-driven subtropical North Atlantic, with uptake
   in winter and outgassing in summer. The seasonal cycle is antiphased in
   the subpolar latitudes relative to the subtropics largely as a result of
   the biologically driven winter-to-summer drawdown of CO2. Over the 10 yr
   analysis period (1998 through 2007), sea surface pCO(2) increased faster
   than that of the atmosphere in large areas poleward of 40 degrees N,
   while in other regions of the North Atlantic the sea surface pCO(2)
   increased at a slower rate, resulting in a barely changing Atlantic
   carbon sink north of the Equator (-0.01 +/- 0.02 PgC yr(-1) decade(-1)).
   Surface ocean pCO(2) increased at a slower rate relative to atmospheric
   CO2 over most of the Atlantic south of the Equator, leading to a
   substantial trend toward a stronger CO2 sink for the entire South
   Atlantic (-0.14 +/- 0.02 PgC yr(-1) decade(-1)). In contrast to the 10
   yr trends, the Atlantic Ocean carbon sink varies relatively little on
   inter-annual timescales (+/- 0.04 PgC yr(-1); 1 sigma).}},

   Experiences at Las Cienegas National Conservation Area}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{There is growing recognition that public lands cannot be managed as
   islands; rather, land management must address the ecological, social,
   and temporal complexity that often spans jurisdictions and traditional
   planning horizons. Collaborative decision making and adaptive management
   (CAM) have been promoted as methods to reconcile competing societal
   demands and respond to complex ecosystem dynamics. We detail the
   experiences of land managers and stakeholders in using CAM at Las
   Cienegas National Conservation Area (LCNCA), a highly valued site under
   the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The CAM process
   at Las Cienegas is marked by strong stakeholder engagement, with four
   core elements: (1) shared watershed goals with measurable resource
   objectives; (2) relevant and reliable scientific information; (3)
   mechanisms to incorporate new information into decision making; and (4)
   shared learning to improve both the process and management actions. The
   combination of stakeholder engagement and adaptive management has led to
   agreement on contentious issues, more innovative solutions, and more
   effective land management. However, the region is now experiencing rapid
   changes outside managers' control, including climate change, human
   population growth, and reduced federal budgets, with large but
   unpredictable impacts on natural resources. Although the CAM experience
   provides a strong foundation for making the difficult and contentious
   management decisions that such changes are likely to require, neither
   collaboration nor adaptive management provides a sufficient structure
   for addressing the externalities that drive uncontrollable and
   unpredictable change. As a result, LCNCA is exploring two specific
   modifications to CAM that may better address emerging challenges,
   including: (1) creating nested resource objectives to distinguish
   between those objectives that may be crucial to maintaining ecological
   resilience from those that may hinder a flexible response to climate
   change, and (2) incorporating scenario planning into CAM to explore how
   climate change may interact with other drivers and alter options for the
   future, to identify robust management actions, and to prioritize
   ecological monitoring efforts. The experiences at LCNCA demonstrate how
   collaboration and adaptive management can be used to improve social and
   environmental outcomes and, with modifications, may help address the
   full range of complexity and change that threatens to overwhelm even the
   best efforts to sustain public lands.}},

Title = {{Demonstration Restoration Measures in Tributaries of the Vindel River
   Catchment}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Some ecological restoration projects include elements of trial and error
   where new measures are repeatedly tried, evaluated, and modified until
   satisfactory results are achieved. Thereafter, the resulting methods may
   be applied on larger scales. A difficult step is judging whether
   developed ``best-practice{''} methods have become reasonably
   ecologically functional or whether further experimentation
   ``demonstration{''} methods can lead to yet better results. Here, we use
   a stream restoration project as a case study for evaluating methods and
   abiotic effects and outlining stakeholder support for demonstration
   restoration measures, rather than only using best-practice methods. Our
   work was located in the Vindel River system, a free-flowing river that
   is part of the Natura 2000 network. The river was exploited for timber
   floating from 1850-1976, and rapids in the main channel and tributaries
   below timberline were channelized to increase timber transport capacity.
   Several side channels in multi-channeled rapids were blocked and the
   flow was concentrated to a single channel from which boulders and large
   wood were removed. Hence, previously heterogeneous environments were
   replaced by more homogeneous systems with limited habitat for riverine
   species. The restoration project strives to alleviate the effects of
   fragmentation and channelization in affected rapids by returning coarse
   sediment from channel margins to the main channel. However, only
   smaller, angular sediment is available given blasting of large boulders,
   and large (old-growth) wood is largely absent; therefore, original
   levels of large boulders and large wood in channels cannot be achieved
   with standard restoration practices. In 10 demonstration sites, we
   compensated for this by adding large boulders and large wood (i.e.,
   entire trees) from adjacent upland areas to previously best-practice
   restored reaches and compared their hydraulic characteristics with 10
   other best-practice sites. The demonstration sites exhibited
   significantly reduced and more variable current velocities, and wider
   channels, but with less variation than pre-restoration. The ecological
   response to this restoration has not yet been studied, but potential
   outcomes are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Cultural ecosystem services constitute a growing field of research that

   publications explicitly dealing with cultural ecosystem services. Our
   aims were: (1) to provide an overview of the current state of research,
   (2) to classify the diversity of research approaches by identifying
   clusters of publications that address cultural ecosystem services in
   similar ways, and (3) to highlight some important challenges for the
   future of cultural ecosystem services research. We reviewed 107
   publications and extracted 20 attributes describing their type and
   content, including methods, scales, drivers of change, and trade-offs
   between services. Using a cluster analysis on a subset of attributes we
   identified five groups of publications: Group 1, conceptual focus, deals
   with theoretical issues; Group 2, descriptive reviews, consists mostly
   of desktop studies; Group 3, localized outcomes, deals with case studies
   coming from different disciplines; Group 4, social and participatory,
   deals mainly with assessing preferences and perceptions; and Group 5,
   economic assessments, provides economic valuations. Emerging themes in
   cultural ecosystem services research relate to improving methods for
   cultural ecosystem services valuation, studying cultural ecosystem
   services in the context of ecosystem service bundles, and more clearly
   articulating policy implications. Based on our findings, we conclude
   that: (1) cultural ecosystem services are well placed as a tool to
   bridge gaps between different academic disciplines and research
   communities, (2) capitalizing on the societal relevance of cultural
   ecosystem services could help address real-world problems, and (3)
   cultural ecosystem services have the potential to foster new conceptual
   links between alternative logics relating to a variety of social and

Title = {{Measuring Household Resilience to Floods: a Case Study in the Vietnamese
   Mekong River Delta}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{The flood is a well-known phenomenon in the Vietnamese Mekong River
   Delta (MRD). Although people have experienced the impact of floods for
   years, some adapt well, but others are vulnerable to floods. Resilience
   to floods is a useful concept to study the capacity of rural households
   to cope with, adapt to, and benefit from floods. Knowledge of the
   resilience of households to floods can help disaster risk managers to
   design policies for living with floods. Most researchers attempt to
   define the concept of resilience; very little research operationalizes
   it in the real context of ``living with floods{''}. We employ a
   subjective well-being approach to measure households' resilience to
   floods. Items that related to households' capacity to cope with, adapt
   to, and benefit from floods were developed using both a five-point
   Likert scale and dichotomous responses. A factor analysis using a
   standardized form of data was employed to identify underlying factors
   that explain different properties of households' resilience to floods.
   Three properties of households' resilience to floods were found: (1)

Title = {{The Relevance of Local Participatory Scenario Planning for Ecosystem
   Management Policies in the Basque Country, Northern Spain}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{As part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in Biscay, Basque
   Country, we described scenarios for Biscay through 2050 in an integrated
   and participatory way by downscaling the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment
   (MA) global scenarios, analyzed how ecosystem services and human
   well-being might change in a range of plausible futures, identified
   management strategies for the territory through a backcasting process,
   and explored the relevance of scenarios to policy making. Our intention
   was to strengthen the link to policy making and to achieve a real
   implementation of our research results in ecosystem management policies.
   We also aimed to provide more insights on how large-scale scenario
   developments can be translated to the local level. In doing so, we
   emphasized specific local characteristics and used highly participatory
   methods focusing on novel elements, such as organizing back-to-back
   workshops, creating coherent scenarios across scales, using visual
   elements to present exploratory scenarios, and combining exploratory
   scenarios with normative backcasting using a World Cafe methodology. The
   outcome scenarios and management proposals are relevant for decision
   making and planning processes at local scale and at the same time, they
   are comparable to other assessment scenarios. This local participatory
   scenario process and tool for landscape planning is already having a
   policy impact thanks to the involvement of public administration
   technicians and policy makers. In the recently renewed strategic policy
   plan for sustainability of the county, this assessment is considered a
   high priority. Therefore, for the next steps of the assessment, detailed
   guidelines for ecosystem management policies are planned.}},

Abstract = {{The Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) program

   This article suggests that REDD+ can become a successful vehicle for
   advancing SFM if it is re-conceived to include support for adaptation as
   one of its primary goals. Some degree of adaptation is necessary to
   effectively implement any form of REDD+, and SFM practices offer the
   core toolkit for securing forest adaptation in the context of REDD+.
   Re-envisioning REDD+ as a dual-focus program aimed at mitigation and
   adaptation builds upon the potential synergies between these two climate
   regime goals and calls upon experiences with SFM to provide the means of
   achieving them. Operationalizing this vision will require development of
   novel arrangements of authority and incentives across scales of
   governance that can provide opportunities for learning in support of a
   larger need for new approaches to governance of global environmental

   diverse approach to representing terrestrial biogeography and
   biogeochemistry based on plant functional trade-offs}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{4137-4177}},
Abstract = {{Terrestrial biosphere models typically abstract the immense diversity of
   vegetation forms and functioning into a relatively small set of
   predefined semi-empirical plant functional types (PFTs). There is
   growing evidence, however, from the field ecology community as well as
   from modelling studies that current PFT schemes may not adequately
   represent the observed variations in plant functional traits and their
   effect on ecosystem functioning. In this paper, we introduce the Jena
   Diversity-Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (JeDi-DGVM) as a new approach
   to terrestrial biosphere modelling with a richer representation of
   functional diversity than traditional modelling approaches based on a
   small number of fixed PFTs.
   JeDi-DGVM simulates the performance of a large number of randomly
   generated plant growth strategies, each defined by a set of 15 trait
   parameters which characterize various aspects of plant functioning
   including carbon allocation, ecophysiology and phenology. Each trait
   parameter is involved in one or more functional trade-offs. These
   trade-offs ultimately determine whether a strategy is able to survive
   under the climatic conditions in a given model grid cell and its
   performance relative to the other strategies. The biogeochemical fluxes
   and land surface properties of the individual strategies are aggregated
   to the grid-cell scale using a mass-based weighting scheme.
   We evaluate the simulated global biogeochemical patterns against a
   variety of field and satellite-based observations following a protocol
   established by the Carbon-Land Model Intercomparison Project. The land
   surface fluxes and vegetation structural properties are reasonably well
   simulated by JeDi-DGVM, and compare favourably with other
   state-of-the-art global vegetation models. We also evaluate the
   simulated patterns of functional diversity and the sensitivity of the
   JeDi-DGVM modelling approach to the number of sampled strategies.
   Altogether, the results demonstrate the parsimonious and flexible nature
   of a functional trade-off approach to global vegetation modelling, i.e.
   it can provide more types of testable outputs than standard PFT-based
   approaches and with fewer inputs.
   The approach implemented here in JeDi-DGVM sets the foundation for
   future applications that will explore the impacts of explicitly
   resolving diverse plant communities, allowing for a more flexible
   temporal and spatial representation of the structure and function of the
   terrestrial biosphere.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{A next-generation in-water profiler designed to measure the apparent
   optical properties (AOPs) of seawater was developed and validated across
   a wide dynamic range of in-water properties. The new free-falling
   instrument, the Compact-Optical Profiling System (C-OPS), was based on
   sensors built with a cluster of 19 state-of-the-art microradiometers
   spanning 320-780 nm and a novel kite-shaped backplane. The new backplane
   includes tunable ballast, a hydrobaric buoyancy chamber, plus pitch and
   roll adjustments, to provide unprecedented stability and vertical
   resolution in near-surface waters. A unique data set was collected as
   part of the development activity plus the first major field campaign
   that used the new instrument, the Malina expedition to the Beaufort Sea
   in the vicinity of the Mackenzie River outflow. The data were of
   sufficient resolution and quality to show that errors - more correctly,
   uncertainties - in the execution of data sampling protocols were
   measurable at the 1\% and 1 cm level with C-OPS. A theoretical
   sensitivity analysis as a function of three water types established by
   the peak in the remote sensing reflectance spectrum, R-rs(lambda),
   revealed which water types and which parts of the spectrum were the most
   sensitive to data acquisition uncertainties. Shallow riverine waters
   were the most sensitive water type, and the ultraviolet and
   near-infrared spectral end members, which are critical to
   next-generation satellite missions, were the most sensitive parts of the
   spectrum. The sensitivity analysis also showed how the use of data
   products based on band ratios significantly mitigated the influence of
   data acquisition uncertainties. The unprecedented vertical resolution
   provided high-quality data products, which supported an alternative
   classification capability based on the spectral diffuse attenuation
   coefficient, K-d(lambda). The K-d(320) and K-d(780) data showed how
   complex coastal systems can be distinguished two-dimensionally and how
   near-ice water masses are different from the neighboring open ocean.
   Finally, an algorithm for predicting the spectral absorption due to
   colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), denoted a(CDOM)(lambda), was
   developed using the K-d(320) /K-d(780) ratio, which was based on a
   linear relationship with respect to a(CDOM)(440). The robustness of the
   approach was established by expanding the use of the algorithm to
   include a geographically different coastal environment, the Southern
   Mid-Atlantic Bight, with no significant change in accuracy
   (approximately 98\% of the variance explained). Alternative spectral end
   members reminiscent of next-generation (340 and 710 nm) as well as
   legacy satellite missions (412 and 670 nm) were also used to accurately
   derive a(CDOM)(440) from K-d(lambda) ratios.}},

Abstract = {{National and international networks and observatories of
   terrestrial-based sensors are emerging rapidly. As such, there is demand
   for a standardized approach to data quality control, as well as
   interoperability of data among sensor networks. The National Ecological
   Observatory Network (NEON) has begun constructing their first

   automated sensors recording more than > 100 Tb of data per year. These
   data are then used to create other datasets and subsequent
   ``higher-level{''} data products. In anticipation of this challenge, an
   overall data quality assurance plan has been developed and the first
   suite of data quality control measures defined. This data-driven
   approach focuses on automated methods for defining a suite of
   plausibility test parameter thresholds. Specifically, these plausibility
   tests scrutinize the data range and variance of each measurement type by
   employing a suite of binary checks. The statistical basis for each of
   these tests is developed, and the methods for calculating test parameter
   thresholds are explored here. While these tests have been used
   elsewhere, we apply them in a novel approach by calculating their
   relevant test parameter thresholds. Finally, implementing automated

Abstract = {{China's grassland has been undergoing rapid changes in the recent past
   owing to increased climate variability and a shift in grassland
   management strategy driven by a series of ecological restoration
   projects. This study investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of Inner
   Mongolia grassland, the main grassland region in China and part of the
   Eurasia Steppe, to detect the interactive nature of climate, ecosystems
   and society. Land-use and landscape patterns for the period from 1985 to
   2009 were analysed based on TM- and MODIS-derived land-use data. Net
   Primary Productivity (NPP) estimated by using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford
   Approach model was used to assess the growth status of grassland.
   Furthermore, the factors related to the dynamics of grassland were
   analysed from the perspectives of two driving factors, climate change
   and human activities. The results indicated that higher temperatures and
   lower precipitation may generally have contributed to grassland
   desertification, particularly in arid regions. During the period from
   1985 to 2000, a higher human population and an increase in livestock
   numbers were the major driving forces responsible for the consistent
   decrease in NPP and a relatively fragmented landscape. From 2000 to
   2009, the implementation of effective ecological restoration projects
   has arrested the grassland deterioration in some ecologically fragile
   regions. However, a rapid growth of livestock numbers has sparked new
   degradation onnon-degraded or lightly degraded grassland, which was
   initially neglected by these projects. In spite of some achievement in
   grassland restoration, China should take further steps to develop
   sustainable management practices for climate adaptation and economic
   development to bring lasting benefits.}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{3109-3125}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies on the impacts of ocean acidification on pelagic
   communities have identified changes in carbon to nutrient dynamics with
   related shifts in elemental stoichiometry. In principle, mesocosm
   experiments provide the opportunity of determining temporal dynamics of
   all relevant carbon and nutrient pools and, thus, calculating elemental
   budgets. In practice, attempts to budget mesocosm enclosures are often
   hampered by uncertainties in some of the measured pools and fluxes, in
   particular due to uncertainties in constraining air-sea gas exchange,
   particle sinking, and wall growth. In an Arctic mesocosm study on ocean
   acidification applying KOSMOS (Kiel Off-Shore Mesocosms for future Ocean
   Simulation), all relevant element pools and fluxes of carbon, nitrogen
   and phosphorus were measured, using an improved experimental design
   intended to narrow down the mentioned uncertainties. Water-column
   concentrations of particulate and dissolved organic and inorganic matter
   were determined daily. New approaches for quantitative estimates of
   material sinking to the bottom of the mesocosms and gas exchange in 48 h
   temporal resolution as well as estimates of wall growth were developed
   to close the gaps in element budgets. However, losses elements from the
   budgets into a sum of insufficiently determined pools were detected, and
   are principally unavoidable in mesocosm investigation. The comparison of
   variability patterns of all single measured datasets revealed analytic
   precision to be the main issue in determination of budgets.
   Uncertainties in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and
   particulate organic phosphorus (POP) were much higher than the summed
   error in determination of the same elements in all other pools. With
   estimates provided for all other major elemental pools, mass balance
   calculations could be used to infer the temporal development of DOC, DON
   and POP pools.
   Future elevated pCO(2) was found to enhance net autotrophic community
   carbon uptake in two of the three experimental phases but did not
   significantly affect particle elemental composition. Enhanced carbon
   consumption appears to result in accumulation of dissolved organic
   carbon under nutrient-recycling summer conditions. This carbon
   over-consumption effect becomes evident from mass balance calculations,
   but was too small to be resolved by direct measurements of dissolved
   organic matter. Faster nutrient uptake by comparatively small algae at
   high CO2 after nutrient addition resulted in reduced production rates
   under future ocean CO2 conditions at the end of the experiment. This CO2
   mediated shift towards smaller phytoplankton and enhanced cycling of
   dissolved matter restricted the development of larger phytoplankton,
   thus pushing the system towards a retention type food chain with overall
   negative effects on export potential.}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{2219-2228}},
Abstract = {{The role of the ocean has been pivotal in modulating rising atmospheric
   CO2 levels since the industrial revolution, sequestering nearly half of
   all fossil-fuel derived CO2 emissions. Net oceanic uptake of CO2 has
   roughly doubled between the 1960s (similar to 1 PgC yr(-1)) and 2000s
   (similar to 2 PgC yr(-1)), with expectations that it will continue to
   absorb even more CO2 with rising future atmospheric CO2 levels. However,
   recent CO2 observational analyses along with numerous model predictions
   suggest the rate of oceanic CO2 uptake is already slowing, largely as a
   result of a natural decadal-scale outgassing signal. This recent CO2
   outgassing signal represents a significant shift in our understanding of
   the oceans role in modulating atmospheric CO2. Current tracer-based
   estimates for the ocean storage of anthropogenic CO2 assume the ocean
   circulation and biology is in steady state, thereby missing the new and
   potentially important ``non-steady state{''} CO2 outgassing signal. By
   combining data-based techniques that assume the ocean is in a steady
   state, with techniques that constrain the net oceanic CO2 uptake signal,
   we show how to extract the non-steady state CO2 signal from
   observations. Over the entire industrial era, the non-steady state CO2
   outgassing signal (similar to 13 +/- 10 Pg C) is estimated to represent
   about 9\% of the total net CO2 inventory change (similar to 142 Pg C).
   However, between 1989 and 2007, the non-steady state CO2 outgassing
   signal (similar to 6.3 Pg C) has likely increased to be similar to 18\%
   of net oceanic CO2 storage over that period (similar to 36 Pg C). The
   present uncertainty of our data-based techniques for oceanic CO2 uptake
   limit our capacity to quantify the non-steady state CO2 signal, however
   with more data and better certainty estimates across a range of diverse
   methods, this important and growing CO2 signal could be better
   constrained in the future.}},

Title = {{Importance of getting the numbers right: quantifying the rapid and

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{169-183}},
Abstract = {{Context. A reliable measure of population size is fundamental to ecology
   and conservation but is often difficult to obtain. The woylie, Bettongia
   penicillata, provides an example where `getting the numbers right' has
   important implications in verifying and quantifying the recent
   unexpected, rapid and substantial declines across much of its range.
   Initial estimates prompted a conservation-status upgrade for the species
   to Endangered by the Australian Government. The present paper
   constitutes the foundational paper addressing the first steps of a
   decline diagnosis framework intended to identify the causes of the
   recent declines.
   Aims. To verify whether the declines in woylie trap-capture rates are
   representative of population change; better quantify the size of the
   largest woylie populations; and review what is understood about the
   ecology of the woylie and identify key knowledge gaps that may be
   relevant to identifying the causes of the recent declines.
   Methods. Monitoring data from live-cage trapping (transects and grids),
   sandpads, woylie diggings and nest-density surveys and spotlighting were
   collated. Population measures derived from trapping data included
   capture rates, number of individuals, abundance estimates based on
   capture-mark-recapture modelling and density using spatially explicit
   capture-recapture models (SECR).
   Key results. The declines in woylie trap-capture rates were verified as
   real population declines and corresponded closely with other measures of
   abundance derived from the same trapping data as well as with
   independent measures. A 95\% decline occurred in the largest extant
   woylie populations (in the Upper Warren region, Western Australia)
   between 2002 and 2008. At a species level, woylies declined similar to
   90\% (1999-2006), from a peak of similar to 200 000 individuals in 1999.
   Conclusions. An accurate formal conservation status is an important
   factor in promoting the conservation of a species. It is recommended
   that the woylie be considered for Critically Endangered status under the
   Australian EPBC Act.
   Implications. Adequate and effective monitoring of species is critical
   to detecting and quantifying population changes in a timely manner.
   Having an accurate measure of population size can have a significant
   impact on the effectiveness of conservation and management efforts.}},

Title = {{Spatial analysis of North Sea cod recruitment: concurrent effects of
   changes in spawning stock biomass, temperature and herring abundance}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{480}},
Pages = {{263+}},
Abstract = {{The decline of the North Sea cod Gadus morhua has been attributed to
   both overfishing and ocean warming. However, another hypothesis is that
   overfishing of piscivorous cod has caused an increased abundance of
   formerly predatory-controlled pelagic fish including herring Clupea
   harengus, which in turn has suppressed the recruitment of cod through
   predation on the early life stages of cod. Here we analyze 40 yr of
   trawl survey data in order to explore how the abundance of young herring
   affects cod recruitment, and how cod biomass affects the abundance of
   herring. In both cases we also take into account the effects of spawner
   biomass (of cod and herring, respectively) and sea temperature. We take
   a novel, explicitly spatial, approach by analyzing these effects on a
   local (185 x 167 km) scale. Our results indicate large spatial
   variability in ecological mechanisms. In the German Bight, high cod
   recruitment is associated with low herring abundance, low temperatures
   and high overall cod spawner biomass. This area used to contain a large
   portion of the cod recruits, and there is a strong correlation between
   the fraction of cod recruits found in this area and overall recruitment.
   In this area, herring recruitment is also negatively associated with the
   abundance of large cod. Thus, for this part of the North Sea, our
   findings are consistent with a reversal of dominance between cod and
   herring; however, herring may affect the cod by competition rather than
   by predation.}},

   strength}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the relative contribution of light and temperature
   on net ecosystem CO2 uptake during the 2006 growing season in a
   polygonal tundra ecosystem in the Lena River Delta in Northern Siberia
   (72 degrees 22'N, 126 degrees 30'E). The occurrence and frequency of
   warm periods may be an important determinant of the magnitude of the
   ecosystem's carbon sink function, as they drive temperature-induced
   changes in respiration. Hot spells during the early portion of the
   growing season, when the photosynthetic apparatus of vascular plants is
   not fully developed, are shown to be more influential in creating
   positive mid-day surface-to-atmosphere net ecosystem CO2 exchange fluxes
   than those occurring later in the season. In this work we also develop
   and present a multi-step bulk flux partition model to better account for
   tundra plant physiology and the specific light conditions of the arctic
   region. These conditions preclude the successful use of traditional
   partition methods that derive a respiration-temperature relationship
   from all nighttime data or from other bulk approaches that are
   insensitive to temperature or light stress. Nighttime growing season
   measurements are rare during the arctic summer, however, so the new
   method allows for temporal variation in the parameters describing both
   ecosystem respiration and gross uptake by fitting both processes at the
   same time. Much of the apparent temperature sensitivity of respiration
   seen in the traditional partition method is revealed in the new method
   to reflect seasonal changes in basal respiration rates. Understanding
   and quantifying the flux partition is an essential precursor to
   describing links between assimilation and respiration at different
   timescales, as it allows a more confident evaluation of measured net
   exchange over a broader range of environmental conditions. The growing
   season CO2 sink estimated by this study is similar to those reported
   previously for this site, and is substantial enough to withstand the
   long, low-level respiratory CO2 release during the rest of the year to
   maintain the site's CO2 sink function on an annual basis.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables,
   usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any
   descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter
   estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and
   hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant
   predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when
   a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to
   another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To
   demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show
   how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over
   spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different
   approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed,
   ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection,
   through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using
   simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing
   complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address
   collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning
   approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its
   impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the
   methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a
   training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance
   on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods
   specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods
   and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and
   threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in
   combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and
   threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in
   the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded
   degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the folk
   lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables
   of |r| >0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to
   severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of
   ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable
   selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches
   reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.}},

Abstract = {{Resource depletion and associated increases in interspecific competition
   are likely to influence differential habitat usage amongst a guild. We
   tested some prominent theoretical concepts using observed differences in
   seasonal habitat use amongst the savanna browser guild (elephant,
   giraffe, impala, kudu and nyala) in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South
   Africa. Herbivore locations (n = 3108) were recorded over 2 y using
   repeated road transects and, for elephant, GPS collars (187 254
   downloads). Densities were calculated using a novel GIS approach
   designed to be a cost-effective method for annual censuses, but also
   able to cope with abrupt changes in visibility. Selectivity for (Manly's
   a) vegetation types, and overlap (Schoener's index) in vegetation type
   usage were calculated. Resource depletion in the dry season resulted in
   all members of the guild increasing selectivity for vegetation types
   (sum of absolute values away from the neutral value for Manly's alpha
   for the guild: dry seasons 3.97, 5.16; corresponding wet seasons 3.12,
   3.68), but decreasing interspecific overlap (80\% of Schoener's indices
   lower in dry season versus wet season). These effects were more marked
   over the second, more severe, dry season. We found support for the niche
   overlap hypothesis and the niche compression hypothesis. The Jarman-Bell
   principle was generally supported, although unexpectedly during the
   severe dry season elephant showed the most selectivity for vegetation
   type. The greater the resource depletion, the more relevant
   interspecific differences in habitat usage become in relation to the
   differential impacts of guild members.}},

Abstract = {{Given the accelerating rate of urbanization worldwide, the sustainable
   provision of urban ecosystem services becomes increasingly important for
   the growing number of city dwellers. Attempts to increase a single
   ecosystem service however often lead to reduction or losses of others.
   For making sound decisions about sustainable urban development,
   knowledge and awareness of the interactions between ecosystem services
   are thus necessary. In this paper, we show how interactive rulers
   embedded in a 3D GIS-based procedural modeling environment can assist in
   making urban ecosystem services trade-offs explicit for sustainable
   urban planning. The interactive rulers are slider bars that offer
   stakeholders the possibility to explore trade-offs in ecosystem services
   reflected in different urban designs. The approach is illustrated in a
   case study in Abu Dhabi, Masdar City, a new city designed from scratch.
   An interactive 3D visualization approach links parametric shape grammars
   for the design of generative urban patterns and the reporting of urban
   ecosystem services. We show how various urban design scenarios can be
   generated in an interactive manner allowing a balance between the
   esthetics of the urban designs and a set of indicators describing the
   provision of relevant ecosystem services. With this approach, the space
   for actions and behavioral alternatives become explicit - a crucial step
   for sustainable urban planning which calls for innovative strategies to
   adapt to these uncertain and rapid changes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The frequency and magnitude of drought is expected to increase in the US
   Great Plains under future climate regimes. Although semiarid systems are

   could alter linkages among biogeochemical processes, and result in new
   feedbacks that influence the timescale of ecosystem recovery. We
   examined changes in carbon and nitrogen cycling in the last 2 years of
   an 11-year drought manipulation in the shortgrass steppe, and under the
   first 2 years of recovery from drought. We measured plant production,
   plant tissue chemistry, soil trace gas flux, and soil inorganic nitrogen
   dynamics to test the extent that this magnitude of drought altered
   carbon and nitrogen fluxes and how these changes affected post-drought
   dynamics. We found that soil inorganic nitrogen was up to five times
   higher under severe drought than under control conditions, but that this
   nitrogen may not have been accessible to plants and microbial
   communities during drought due to diffusion limitations. Drought plots
   had higher N2O flux when they received equal rainfall pulses, showing
   that this accumulated N may be vulnerable to loss. In addition, plants
   in drought plots had higher tissue nitrogen for 2 years following
   drought. These results show that decadal-length droughts that may occur
   under future precipitation regimes are likely to alter ecosystem
   properties through interactions among precipitation, vegetation, and N
   cycling. Shifts in plant N, vulnerability of nitrogen to loss, and
   rainfall use efficiency that we observed are likely to affect the
   recovery time of semiarid systems subject to droughts of this magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic studies of social behaviour have currently received new impetus
   from models including indirect genetic effects (IGEs) of social
   partners. This study aimed at investigating the contribution of
   conspecifics in social dominance, considered as response of dyadic
   interaction that is, winning (dominant individual) or losing
   (subordinate). A genetic correlation of -1 is expected between the
   attitude to win and the attitude to loose, and because a population
   always accounts for half winners and half losers, the heritability of
   the dominant status should be close to zero. Specifically, social
   dominance was studied in Aosta Chestnut and Aosta Black Pied (Bos
   taurus) breeds, alpine rustic cattle famous for traditional tournaments
   where pairs of cows assess dominant status in bloodless fights. The
   outcomes of 25 590 dyadic interactions performed by 8159 individuals in
   11 years were analysed by applying a classical quantitative model and
   models including indirect effects. Data were analysed via Bayesian
   approach on a threshold trait. The assessment of variances revealed a
   genetic correlation of -0.976 between direct and indirect genetic
   components. The heritability measured on a liability scale was 0.122 for
   direct phenotype, but decreased to 0.014 when the total heritable
   variance (TBV) was considered. The trend of estimated breeding values
   showed that the total TBV was constant over the years, even though its
   direct component increased and the indirect part decreased. This result
   confirms the relevance of IGEs on social behaviour and the assumption
   that the mean individual social dominance cannot evolve within a

   Three areas of high molecular diversity were identified: one in southern

Abstract = {{Aim We test the hypothesis that the European destruction of western
   Tasmanian Aboriginal society, and consequent changes in burning
   patterns, resulted in succession towards rain forest near the coast, and
   an increase in the area of more fire-resistant sedgeland in inland
   areas. Location South-western and western Tasmania, Australia. Methods
   Attributes of organic soils (surface and underlying dominant horizons)
   beneath rain forest and sedgeland were described and measured from 559
   soil pits in areas with highly siliceous surface geology. Multiple
   logistic regression was used to discriminate the dominant horizons of
   rain forest and sedgeland soils. This equation was used to derive scores
   for all soil pits. The hypothesis that change was greater near existing
   boundaries was tested using correlation. The hypothesis that change was
   greater at coastal than inland locations was tested using ANOVA. Results
   Both upper horizons of the soils under the fire-sensitive rain forest
   (14C-dated to be younger than 60 years) and dominant horizons of these
   soils had significantly higher organic contents, lower bulk density and
   more nitrogen than the soils under the fire-requiring sedgeland.
   Twenty-nine per cent of the soils under sedgeland had dominant horizons
   that indicated past rain forest. One-quarter of the soils under rain
   forest had dominant horizons characteristic of sedgeland soils. Although
   results were heterogeneous in both locations, the former difference was
   more common inland and the latter near the coast. Change was not higher
   close to present boundaries. Main conclusions The characteristics of the
   dominant horizons and the post-colonial surface horizon give a strong
   indication of the vegetation that formed them. Changes in fire regimes,
   caused by the displacement of Tasmanian Aborigines by Europeans, appear
   to have caused vegetation changes that differed within and between the

   injury to the bole cambium due to differences in bark investment
   patterns, but were all very exposed to scorching and crown injury.
   Overall, most of sampled individuals are likely top-killed by low
   intensity fires (<1000 kW.m-1), which are frequent according to our
   simulations.
   Conclusions The early secondary successional forest species growing in
   New Caledonian savannas are poorly adapted to fire, in comparison with
   literature on worldwide trees in savannas. As a result, their juveniles
   are unlikely to reach adult size in fire-prone areas. Restoration using
   the most fire-tolerant species and fire prevention may be complementary
   strategies to manage such tropical landscapes in order to conserve
   biodiversity and ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{After decades of whaling, Oceania humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae
   have such a low rate of recovery that a trend is not currently
   measurable. They are listed as Endangered by the IUCN, and any possible
   threat to the whales needs to be carefully monitored and mitigated.
   Whale-watching activities represent an important economic development
   throughout the South Pacific but also carry a potential risk of impact
   for these recovering populations. New Caledonia is among the leading
   countries for humpback whale watching in Oceania. Land-based theodolite
   observations were conducted between 2005 and 2007 to assess the effect
   of boats on humpback whale behaviour in New Caledonia. Natural
   experiments were used to investigate the response of whales to boat
   approaches, and opportunistic observations were used to assess which
   variables best described variability in behaviour. Over 80\% of whales
   approached by boats significantly changed their behaviour. Changes in
   path predictability (directness and deviation index) were most commonly
   affected and are likely to represent an efficient and low-cost avoidance
   strategy. Linear models showed that as boats get closer, humpback whales
   significantly increased the sinuosity of their path. The threshold for
   such a response corresponded to an approach distance of 335 m. Based on
   these results and considering the vulnerability of the humpback whale
   population in New Caledonia, we suggest reinforcing management measures
   to increase the likelihood that the whale-watching industry is
   sustainable.}},

   approach, local stakeholders were interviewed to identify potential
   tools to facilitate ICZM in the Department. The in-depth interviews
   highlighted a multitude of conflicting land uses (urbanization, farming,
   natural areas, etc.) resulting from the sectorial management put in
   place during the 1960. In response, the project implemented a Land and
   Ecosystem Accounting technique (LEAC). This tool aimed to identify how
   conflicting land use issues have evolved over the years and the
   consequences that this has on the site. Ecosystem accounts recorded the
   state of natural resources and ecosystem components in terms of quality
   (e. g. land-cover); quantity (e. g.volume of biomass, area of certain
   land-cover, number of species etc.) and changes in quality and quantity
   in time and space. The first results were presented to the stakeholders
   in the form of maps during a participative workshop, opening discussion
   for possible improvements. This pilot test demonstrates the importance
   of implicating local stakeholders in the development process in order to

Abstract = {{For the environmental conservation in enclosed coastal seas, Japan has
   implemented such measures as effluent regulations to achieve ``clean
   seas.{''} But some areas such as the Seto Inland Sea, where the water
   quality has been comparatively improved, entered the next phase, and the
   new goal is a ``beautiful, bio-diverse, bustling-with-people and
   bountiful ocean.{''}
   In this context, we are working on Environmental Quality Standards for
   bottom-layer dissolved oxygen, which is one of the important elements
   for inhabitation of aquatic creatures, and water transparency, a factor
   which affects the growth of aquatic creatures and the familiarity of
   waters.
   Some enclosed coastal sea areas in our country are still suffering from
   frequent generation of algae blooms and oxygen deficient water masses
   due to eutrophication. In other areas, however, the reduction of
   nutrient loads, hindering the circulation of nutrients to organisms of
   higher trophic levels in food chain, is considered to have changed the
   balance of ecosystem and caused a decline in fishery resources. For such
   areas, it is necessary to rebalance the circulation of nutrients through
   the entire cycle from land to sea areas.
   To deal with these problems, efficient and effective management policies
   for a smooth circulation of nutrients through land and sea areas should
   be specifically established for respective coastal sea areas. For this
   purpose, the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) has had discussions to
   develop ``Action Plan for Healthy Material Circulation in Ocean{''} for
   three years since 2010. The plan, by integrating management of land and
   sea areas for a smooth material circulation, aims to improve not only
   water quality but also biodiversity and biological productivity and to
   conserve habitats of aquatic creatures. This will bring about richer and
   healthier oceans in the future. The plans are drawn up per region
   selected as a model, and the plans are being implemented one by one upon
   completion.
   In addition, MOE supports the restoration efforts of the regions
   affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11th of 2011. The
   environments of such areas were greatly damaged by landform changes in
   coastal lines and sea bottoms as well as disappearance of seaweed beds.
   We are assisting the environmental recovery, using the method and the
   knowhow of Sato-umi Creation. Sato-umi is defined as a coastal zone
   where the livelihood of human beings and the blessings of nature coexist
   harmoniously with coastal area eco-systems. We apply this approach to
   disaster-affected sea areas in hope of accelerating the recovery and
   promoting Sato-umi creation.}},

Volume = {{247}},
Pages = {{71-82}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Wind is the dominant agent of damage in forests in Western Europe.
   Traditional wind-damage models calculate a probability for damage or a
   critical wind speed at which damage occurs. However, in a dynamic
   vegetation model actual damage to stands and individual trees is needed
   to get a dynamical progression of the vegetation. We present a prototype
   for a new approach to modelling forest wind damage at the regional
   scale, which we incorporate within a dynamic vegetation model. The
   approach is based on knowledge from both empirical and mechanical models
   and calculates the damaged fraction of a cohort based on wind load and a
   sensitivity that depends on the current physical state and history of
   the cohort in relation to the ecosystem. The modelling concept has been
   developed, calibrated and evaluated for Swedish conditions but can be
   applicable to other similar areas with minor modification. Because of
   the stochastic nature of local wind load and the difficulty of
   describing the stand-level exposure, the ability to explain observed
   damage at stand level was low. Regional level variation in damage, which
   more depends on the wind load, was however explained reasonably well
   (R-2 = 0.43). We suggest that this is a useful concept for evaluating
   alternatives of forest management under different climate scenarios in
   the process of adaptation to future storm-damage risks. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Within the ecosystem services framework, this study explores local
   population preferences for different land-use management options in the
   Nacimiento watershed (south-eastern Spain). To this end, we analysed the
   benefits generated by the watershed through a choice experiment. We
   selected two ecological (river quality and protected area), three
   socio-economic (traditional agriculture, ecotourism facilities and wind
   farms) and one monetary (tax reallocation) attributes associated with
   various ecosystem services in the area, where changes in land-use are
   occurring. The data were first analysed using a multinomial logit model.
   Then, a mixed logit model was used to account for heterogeneity across
   respondent preferences. Our results indicated that the respondents would
   support a new management plan, focussing on traditional farming and
   river quality. Fostering traditional agriculture and ecotourism were
   also supported by those who consider the preservation of local identity
   to be important; however, greater priority should be given to
   integrating the protected area with the preservation of local identity
   and the priorities of the local population. Furthermore, future stated
   preference studies to explore the trade-offs among rural-area-management
   policies should consider using tax reallocation as payment vehicle.

Abstract = {{Habitat suitability (HS) maps are widely used tools in wildlife science
   and establish a link between wildlife populations and landscape pattern.
   Although HS maps spatially depict the distribution of optimal resources
   for a species, they do not reveal the population size a landscape is
   capable of supporting-information that is often crucial for decision
   makers and managers. We used a new approach, ``maximum clique
   analysis,'' to demonstrate how HS maps for territorial species can be
   used to estimate the carrying capacity, N-k, of a given landscape. We
   estimated the N-k of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) and bobcats (Lynx
   rufus) in an 1153-km(2) study area in Vermont, USA. These two species
   were selected to highlight different approaches in building an HS map as
   well as computational challenges that can arise in a maximum clique
   analysis. We derived 30-m(2) HS maps for each species via occupancy
   modeling (Ovenbird) and by resource utilization modeling (bobcats). For
   each species, we then identified all pixel locations on the map (points)
   that had sufficient resources in the surrounding area to maintain a home
   range (termed a ``pseudo-home range''). These locations were converted
   to a mathematical graph, where any two points were linked if two
   pseudo-home ranges could exist on the landscape without violating
   territory boundaries. We used the program Cliquer to find the maximum
   clique of each graph. The resulting estimates of N-k = 236 Ovenbirds and
   N-k = 42 female bobcats were sensitive to different assumptions and
   model inputs. Estimates of N-k via alternative, ad hoc methods were 1.4
   to >30 times greater than the maximum clique estimate, suggesting that
   the alternative results may be upwardly biased. The maximum clique
   analysis was computationally intensive but could handle problems with
   <1500 total pseudo-home ranges (points). Given present computational
   constraints, it is best suited for species that occur in clustered
   distributions (where the problem can be broken into several, smaller
   problems), or for species with large home ranges relative to grid scale
   where resampling the points to a coarser resolution can reduce the
   problem to manageable proportions.}},

Abstract = {{The literature on speciation has expanded dramatically in recent years,
   catalyzed by the emergence of new conceptual frameworks, new theoretical
   approaches, and new methods for characterizing pattern and inferring
   process. As a consequence, the language used to describe the speciation
   process has become more complex. Increasing complexity may be an
   accurate reflection of current thinking with respect to how phenotypic
   differences limit gene flow, how selection results in the evolution of
   reproductive isolation, and genetic changes that contribute to
   speciation. However, increased language complexity has come at a cost;
   old definitions have been reconfigured and new terms have been
   introduced. In some instances, the introduction of new terminology has
   failed to recognize historical usage, leading to unnecessary ambiguity
   and redundancy. Although the writings of Mayr and Dobzhansky remain a
   reference point in the language of speciation, the last decades of the
   20th century saw substantial changes in our thinking about the
   speciation process. During that period, the language of speciation
   remained relatively stable. In contrast, the first decade of the 21st

Abstract = {{Conspicuous innovations in the history of life are often preceded by
   more cryptic genetic and developmental precursors. In many cases, these

   permits estimation of precursor locations. We apply it to the evolution
   of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), an ecologically significant trait
   mediating a widespread mutualism between plants and ants. In legumes, a
   species-rich clade with morphologically diverse EFNs, the precursor
   model fits the data on EFN occurrences significantly better than

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Population ecologists often use telemetry to estimate the probability
   that an animal is available for sampling (availability probability).
   Such estimates are paramount for generating reliable estimates of animal
   abundance and are sometimes of biological interest in their own right
   (e.g. for characterizing pinniped haul-out behaviour or landbird singing
   frequency). We consider the estimation of availability probability from
   telemetry data when there are missing records. When records are
   missing-completely-at-random (i.e. not influenced by whether an animal
   is available for sampling or other covariates), approaches that censor
   missing records result in unbiased estimates of availability
   probability. However, censoring such records can result in bias when
   data are not missing-completely-at-random. We present a novel Bayesian
   temporal availability model that can be used to explicitly account for
   the process by which missing data arise. Our approach couples an
   underlying model for the partially observed availability process
   together with an observation model that allows state-dependent
   probabilities of missingness. This approach provides relatively unbiased
   estimates of availability probability even in the face of violations of
   the missing-at-random assumption. A new R package, TempOcc, is
   introduced to automate estimation. We demonstrate the utility of our
   approach by analysing both simulated data and hourly satellite telemetry
   records for 157 ice-associated seals in the Bering Sea, for which 27\%
   of records were missing. In this case, we were interested in generating
   unbiased estimates of haul-out probabilities. Such probabilities are
   necessary when estimating abundance from aerial survey counts and
   assessing possible changes in seal phenology. Our analysis indicates
   that the missing-at-random assumption is indeed violated in telemetry
   studies of phocid seals in the Bering Sea. However, estimates of
   availability probability do not depend critically on this assumption. We
   recommend that ecologists routinely consider the implications of
   violating the missing-at-random assumption when estimating availability
   probabilities. Where possible, the modelling framework articulated in
   this study can be used to diagnose and correct for violations of the
   missing-at-random assumption.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a first approach on the risk assessment in port
   navigation using GUIOMAR, an integrated system for port and coastal
   engineering modelling developed at the National Civil Engineering
   Laboratory (LNEC), Portugal, using a GIS software environment. A set of
   automatic procedures was designed to include a new methodology based on
   the amplitude of the wave-induced vertical movement of a ship along its
   trajectory. In this methodology, the risk in port navigation is assessed
   on the basis of a combination of the probability of exceedance of a
   pre-set threshold for the ship's vertical movements and its
   consequences. To test the new procedures, a set of sea wave records
   obtained at the Sines wave-buoy from 1988 to 2002 was transferred into
   Sines Port using two numerical models of sea wave propagation and
   deformation (SWAN and DREAMS), included in the GUIOMAR system. The
   numerical model WAMIT was used for estimating the wave-induced ship's
   vertical movements inside the port. By applying the new procedures,
   automatic generation of risk maps was carried out for navigation in the
   vicinity of the West breakwater of the Port of Sines. The recent
   developments contribute towards a more versatile and efficient GUIOMAR
   system, which results in a more adequate tool to support decision-making

Abstract = {{The genetic theory of morphological evolution postulates that form
   evolves largely by changing the expression proteins that are
   functionally conserved. It follows that understanding the function of
   proteins during different phases of development as well as the
   mechanisms by which the functions are modified is a prerequisite for
   understanding evolutionary change. Male pied flycatchers exhibit marked
   phenotypic variation in their breeding plumage. This variation has
   repeatedly been shown to have adaptive significance, but the molecular
   basis of this variation is not known. Here, we characterize the proteome
   of developing pied flycatcher feathers from differently pigmented males
   and also introduce a new method for examining the effect sizes of
   expression differences in protein interaction networks. Approximately
   300 proteins were identified in the developing feathers of males. Gene
   products associated with cellular transport, cell metabolism and protein
   synthesis formed a large part of the developing feather proteome.
   Sixty-five proteins associated with the development of the epidermis
   and/or pigmentation were detected in the data. The examination of
   expression level differences of proteinprotein interaction networks
   revealed an immunological signallingrelated network to exhibit
   significantly higher expression in black compared to brown males.
   Additionally, indications of differences in energy balance and oxidative
   stress related characteristics were detected. Together, these results
   provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary
   significance of plumage colour variation.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how natural communities confront different types of
   natural and anthropogenic stressors has gained much more attention as
   global climate change imposes nearly unpredictable ecosystem states or
   regimes. In the Humboldt Current ecosystem this seems to be a priority
   task due to the complex dynamics caused by the El Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO). Herein a 17-year (1991-2007) time-series data-set of
   macrobenthic community structure and environmental parameters from
   seasonal sampling from four fixed stations off Punta Coloso (23 degrees
   45S, 70 degrees 28W northern of Chile) is analyzed. The aim of this
   study was to assess benthic responses to ENSO-associated anomalies. nMDS
   analysis revealed changes in community structure associated to El Nino
   (1997-1998) and La Nina (1999-2000). From 1991, communities gradually
   increased in dissimilarity up to 1998 but after 2000 dissimilarity
   decreased, thus approaching the early community structure in a
   counterclockwise like direction. This suggested a cyclical pattern
   throughout time, which was tested with a cyclicity analysis. The test
   showed a significant correlation between the dissimilarity biotic matrix
   and a perfect cyclicity model matrix. The finding of a 17-year cycle in
   the variation of community structure adds new insights and contrast to
   previous observations of increments in diversity and alternation of
   dominant taxa associated to environmental forcing. It needs to be
   revealed if this cycle forms part of a major decadal oscillation in the
   benthic subsystem. Nevertheless, this result is in line with the decadal
   pattern of variability observed for pelagic communities associated to
   warm and cold phases of ENSO.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial exploitation and abrupt changes of the natural conditions may
   have severe impacts on the Arctic deep-sea ecosystem. The present
   recolonisation experiment mimicked a situation after a catastrophic
   disturbance (e.g. by turbidites caused by destabilised continental
   slopes after methane hydrate decomposition) and investigated whether the
   recolonisation of a deep-sea habitat by meiobenthic organisms is
   fostered by variations in nutrition and/or sediment structure. Two
   ``Sediment Tray Free Vehicles{''} were deployed for 1 year in summer
   2003 at 2,500 m water depth in the Arctic deep-sea in the eastern Fram
   Strait. The recolonisation trays were filled with different artificial
   and natural sediment types (glass beads, sand, sediment mixture, pure
   deep-sea sediment) and were enriched with various types of food (algae,
   yeast, fish). After 1 year, meiobenthos abundances and various
   sediment-related environmental parameters were investigated.
   Foraminifera were generally the most successful group: they dominated
   all treatments and accounted for about 87 \% of the total meiobenthos.
   Colonising meiobenthos specimens were generally smaller compared to
   those in the surrounding deep-sea sediment, suggesting an active
   recolonisation by juveniles. Although experimental treatments with
   fine-grained, algae-enriched sediment showed abundances closest to
   natural conditions, the results suggest that food availability was the
   main determining factor for a successful recolonisation by meiobenthos,
   and the structure of recolonised sediments was shown to have a
   subordinate influence.}},

Abstract = {{Global climate change has raised important questions about ecosystem

   we review data from comparative studies of kettle lakes along a

Abstract = {{Intense harvesting and slash fires during the late 1800s and early 1900s
   led to homogenization throughout the Great Lakes region via the
   conversion from tamarack, pine, and spruce forests to aspen forests,
   which are supported by the forest products industry. Subsequently,
   mesophication occurred in the eastern United States due to fire
   suppression, transforming oak woodlands to mixed mesophytic forests. We
   explored both homogenization and mesophication at a regional scale by
   quantifying changes in community composition and density between
   historical General Land Office survey points and current USDA Forest
   Analysis and Inventory plots for Minnesota's Laurentian Mixed and
   Eastern Broadleaf Forest provinces. We used the Morisita plotless
   density estimator and applied corrections for surveyor bias to estimate
   density for historical forests and we used known densities of FIA plots
   to predict current densities with random forests, an ensemble regression
   tree method, and terrain and soil predictor variables. Of the 43
   ecological units used in the analysis, only one current community was
   similar to its historical counterpart. Within the Laurentian Mixed
   Forest province, forest density of primarily mature aspen stands is
   reduced slightly today compared to the tamarack-dominated forests of the
   past. Conversely, in the Eastern Broadleaf Forest province, forest
   densities have increased compared to historical pine and oak woodlands,
   due to increases of densely growing, fire-sensitive species. Ordinations
   of functional traits and structure showed substantial changes between
   current and historical communities as well as reduced differentiation
   among current communities compared to their historical counterparts.
   Homogenization in the Laurentian Mixed Forest is occurring by transition
   from early-successional to late-successional species, with associated
   changes in forest ecosystems, and homogenization and mesophication in
   the Eastern Broadleaf Forest are occurring by transition from
   disturbance-stabilized genera of open forest ecosystems to
   non-disturbance-dependent genera of dense forests. Despite different
   starting points of historical forest ecosystems in the Laurentian Mixed
   Forest and Eastern Broadleaf Forest, we found homogenization and
   mesophication to be interrelated in the convergence of composition and
   densities along a common trajectory to dense forests composed of
   late-successional species in Minnesota.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{189-201}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To improve the sustainability of agricultural systems of the Lombardia
   region (northern Italy), a mixed indicator-model-expert approach was
   used. Starting from the results of a previous assessment of current
   management (ACT) in dairy and arable farms, alternative management
   scenarios at field level were designed in order to reduce nitrogen (N)
   losses whilst maintaining or improving the environmental and economic
   sustainability at the farming system level. By working with a group of
   experts supported by a mechanisation model and a cropping system model,
   two alternative N management scenarios were defined following a
   step-by-step decision procedure. The first scenario (FERT) is an
   improvement of the current fertiliser management scheme, applied at the
   same crops as in ACT and aimed at maintaining the same yields. The
   second scenario (ROT) is based on changes in crop rotations by
   introducing new crops to reduce N losses and to maintain economic
   profitability. The sustainability of the two scenarios was assessed and
   compared with agro-ecological and economic indicators. The results of
   FERT, indicate that the application of adequate N management plans tuned
   to the production target and the promotion of best management practices
   may help to reduce N surplus and consequently to save fossil energy and
   to decrease the costs of production. In the ROT scenario, the
   introduction of alfalfa cultivation reduces N surplus on maize, whereas
   intensive double cropping systems (two crops harvested in 12 months)
   increase N surplus and require higher energy consumptions and production
   costs compared to cultivating a summer crop only. However, in rotational
   systems more favourable weed population dynamics are expected compared
   to ACT. Both alternative scenarios were not implemented in practice, but
   they are realistic and are consistent with results of experiments where
   management options similar to those introduced in FERT and ROT were
   tested.
   This work indicates that the rational integration between scientific
   tools (indicators and models) and expert knowledge is adequate to deal
   with complex farming and cropping systems, which require a
   multidisciplinary approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{563-568}},

Abstract = {{In this article we test the notion that adaptation to climate change in
   grazed rangelands requires little more effort than current approaches to
   risk management because the inherent climate variability that
   characterizes rangelands provides a management environment that is
   preadapted to climate change. We also examine the alternative hypothesis
   that rangeland ecosystems and the people they support are highly
   vulnerable to climate change. Past climate is likely to become an
   increasingly poor predictor of the future, so there is a risk in relying
   on adaptation approaches developed solely in response to existing
   variability. We find incremental, autonomous adaptation will be
   sufficient to deal with most of the challenges provided by the gradual
   expression of climate change in the next decade or two. However,
   projections of greater climate change in the future means that the
   responses required are qualitatively as well as quantitatively different
   and are beyond the existing suite of adaptation strategies and coping
   range. The proactive adaptation responses required go well beyond
   incremental on-farm or local actions. New policies will be needed to
   deal with transformational changes associated with land tenure issues
   and challenges of some displacement and migration of people in
   vulnerable parts of rangelands. Even where appropriate adaptation
   actions can be framed, issues of when to act and how much to act in a
   proactive way remain a challenge for research, management, and policy.
   Whether incremental or transformational involving system changes, a
   diversity of adaptation options will be required in different rangeland
   regions to enhance social and ecological resilience.}},

Abstract = {{A critical challenge for range scientists is to provide input to

   disciplines of range science, basic ecology, and global ecology use
   different perspectives and approaches with different levels of detail to
   extrapolate information and understanding from well-studied locations to
   other land units. However, these traditional approaches are expected to
   be insufficient in the future as both human and climatic drivers change
   in magnitude and direction, spatial heterogeneity in land cover and its
   use increases, and rangelands become increasingly connected at local to
   global scales by flows of materials, people, and information. Here we
   argue that to overcome limitations of each individual discipline, and to
   address future rangeland problems effectively, scientists will need to
   integrate these disciplines successfully and in novel ways. The
   objectives of this article are 1) to describe the background, historical
   development, and limitations of current approaches employed by these

Abstract = {{Adapting what we currently know about ecosystems to a future where

   Current tools for knowledge discovery and application are limited

   to specific situations. We propose development of integrated knowledge
   systems (KSs)-collections of resources (e.g., data, analytical tools,
   literature) drawn from disparate domains and organized around topics by
   process-based conceptual models. An integrated KS would define relevance
   by ecological attributes (e.g., soils, climate, vegetation) and location
   as a flexible mechanism for organizing, finding, and applying knowledge
   to rangeland management. A KS provides knowledge sources within a
   decision-making framework that defines what knowledge is needed and how
   it will be used to make decisions. Knowledge from a KS can identify
   appropriate spatial and temporal scales to address specific resource
   questions or objectives. Several factors currently limit KS development
   and implementation. These include limited interoperability of disparate
   information and knowledge systems; lack of consistent geographic
   referencing of knowledge; incomplete and inconsistent documentation of
   the origin, history and meaning of data and information; underexploited
   application of remote sensing products; limited ability to extrapolate

   the collective knowledge of rangeland professionals to address changing

Abstract = {{Metapopulations function and persist through a combination of processes
   acting at a variety of spatial scales. Although the contributions of
   stage structure, spatially correlated processes, and the rescue effect
   to metapopulation dynamics have been investigated in isolation, there is
   no empirical demonstration of all of these processes shaping dynamics in
   a single system. Dispersal and settlement differ according to the life
   stage involved; therefore, stage-specific population size may outperform
   total population size when predicting colonization-extinction dynamics.
   Synchrony in patch dynamics can lead to accelerated metapopulation
   extinction, although empirical evidence of the interplay between
   correlated colonization events and correlated extinctions is lacking.
   Likewise, few empirical examples exist that provide compelling evidence
   of migration acting to reduce extinction risk (the rescue effect). We
   parameterized a hierarchy of metapopulation models to investigate these
   predictions using a seven-year study of a naturally occurring water vole
   (Arvicola amphibius) metapopulation. Specifically, we demonstrated the
   importance of local stage structure in predicting both colonization and
   extinction events using juvenile and adult population sizes,
   respectively. Using a novel approach for quantifying correlation in
   extinction events, we compared the scale of synchrony in colonization
   and extinction. Strikingly, the scale of dispersal acting to synchronize
   colonization was an order of magnitude larger than that of correlated
   extinctions (halving distance of the effect: 12.40 km and 0.89 km,
   respectively). Additionally, we found compelling evidence for the
   existence of a nontrivial rescue effect. Here we provide a novel
   empirical demonstration of a variety of metapopulation processes
   operating at multiple spatial scales, further emphasizing the need to
   consider stage structure and local synchrony in the dynamics of
   spatially dependent, stage-structured (meta) populations.}},

Abstract = {{The tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) is the only living representative of
   Rhynchocephalia, a group of small vertebrates that originated about 250
   million years ago. The tuatara has been referred to as a living fossil;
   however, the group to which it belongs included a much greater diversity
   of forms in the Mesozoic. We explore the morphological diversity of
   Rhynchocephalia and stem lepidosaur relatives (Sphenodon plus 13 fossil
   relatives) by employing a combination of geometric morphometrics and
   comparative methods. Geometric morphometrics is used to explore cranium
   size and shape at interspecific scale, while comparative methods are
   employed to test association between skull shape and size and tooth
   number after taking phylogeny into account. Two phylogenetic topologies
   have been considered to generate a phylomorphospace and quantify the
   phylogenetic signal in skull shape data, the ancestral state
   reconstruction as well as morphological disparity using disparity
   through time plots (DTT). Rhynchocephalia exhibit a significant
   phylogenetic signal in skull shape that compares well with that computed
   for other extinct vertebrate groups. A consistent form of allometry has
   little impact on skull shape evolution while the number of teeth
   significantly correlates with skull shape also after taking phylogeny
   into account. The ancestral state reconstruction demonstrates a dramatic
   shape difference between the skull of Sphenodon and its much larger
   Cretaceous relative Priosphenodon. Additionally, DTT demonstrates that
   skull shape disparity is higher between rather than within clades while
   the opposite applies to skull size and number of teeth. These results
   were not altered by the use of competing phylogenic hypotheses.
   Rhynchocephalia evolved as a morphologically diverse group with a
   dramatic radiation in the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic about 200
   million years ago. Differences in size are not marked between species
   whereas changes in number of teeth are associated with co-ordinated
   shape changes in the skull to accommodate larger masticatory muscles.
   These results show that the tuatara is not the product of evolutionary
   stasis but that it represents the only survivor of a diverse Mesozoic
   radiation whose subsequent decline remains to be explained.}},

Abstract = {{Much effort has been devoted to understanding the function of
   extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) for antplantherbivore interactions.
   However, the pattern of evolution of such structures throughout the
   history of plant lineages remains unexplored. In this study, we used
   empirical knowledge on plant defences mediated by ants as a theoretical
   framework to test specific hypotheses about the adaptive role of EFNs
   during plant evolution. Emphasis was given to different processes
   (neutral or adaptive) and factors (habitat change and trade-offs with
   new trichomes) that may have affected the evolution of antplant
   associations. We measured seven EFN quantitative traits in all 105
   species included in a well-supported phylogeny of the tribe Bignonieae
   (Bignoniaceae) and collected field data on antEFN interactions in 32
   species. We identified a positive association between ant visitation (a
   surrogate of ant guarding) and the abundance of EFNs in vegetative plant
   parts and rejected the hypothesis of phylogenetic conservatism of EFNs,
   with most traits presenting K-values < 1. Modelling the evolution of EFN
   traits using maximum likelihood approaches further suggested adaptive
   evolution, with static-optimum models showing a better fit than purely
   drift models. In addition, the abundance of EFNs was associated with
   habitat shifts (with a decrease in the abundance of EFNs from forest to
   savannas), and a potential trade-off was detected between the abundance
   of EFNs and estipitate glandular trichomes (i.e. trichomes with sticky
   secretion). These evolutionary associations suggest divergent selection
   between species as well as explains K-values < 1. Experimental studies
   with multiple lineages of forest and savanna taxa may improve our
   understanding of the role of nectaries in plants. Overall, our results
   suggest that the evolution of EFNs was likely associated with the
   adaptive process which probably played an important role in the
   diversification of this plant group.}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Aim Abrupt tree lines are relatively rare world-wide and are poorly
   understood. We studied demographic processes at abrupt tree lines to
   better understand the factors governing their dynamics. Location Five
   Nothofagus-dominated tree line sites across the South Island, New
   Zealand. Methods All Nothofagus stems at or above the tree line were
   tagged and their spatial locations and heights recorded on three
   occasions over 15 years at each site. We estimated rates of stem height
   growth, recruitment and mortality, and used these data to develop a
   demographic model to project stem numbers into the future. Results Stem
   numbers had increased above the tree line at most sites over the last 15
   years, but with little evidence of tree line advance. Growth, mortality
   and recruitment rates, modelled as a function of stem size, showed
   variation through time and among sites. Using a demographic model to
   project the numbers of stems above tree line 15 years into the future
   suggests that stem number will continue to increase, but that these tree
   lines are unlikely to advance at the rate predicted by recent climate
   warming. Across sites, variation in the rate of change in the number of
   stems above the tree line was most strongly related to variation in
   recruitment rates. Main conclusions Forest expansion at the abrupt
   Nothofagus tree line in New Zealand appears to be limited primarily by a
   lack of recruitment of new stems, which may be due to a paucity of
   suitable sheltered microsites for seedling establishment. Based on past
   demographic rates, our results suggest that these tree lines are
   relatively unresponsive to recent climate warming and are unlikely to
   show substantial upslope movement if past demographic trends continue.}},

Abstract = {{Imagine a single pathogen that is responsible for mass mortality of over
   a third of an entire vertebrate class. For example, if a single pathogen
   were causing the death, decline and extinction of 30\% of mammal species
   (including humans), the entire world would be paying attention. This is
   what has been happening to the world's amphibians the frogs, toads and
   salamanders that are affected by the chytrid fungal pathogen,
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (referred to as Bd), which are
   consequently declining at an alarming rate. It has aptly been described
   as the worst pathogen in history in terms of its effects on biodiversity
   (Kilpatrick etal. 2010). The pathogen was only formally described about
   13years ago (Longcore etal. 1999), and scientists are still in the
   process of determining where it came from and investigating the
   question: why now? Healthy debate has ensued as to whether Bd is a
   globally endemic organism that only recently started causing high
   mortality due to shifting host responses and/or environmental change
   (e.g. Pounds etal. 2006) or whether a virulent strain of the pathogen
   has rapidly disseminated around the world in recent decades, affecting
   new regions with a vengeance (e.g. Morehouse etal. 2003; Weldon etal.
   2004; Lips etal. 2008). We are finally beginning to shed more light on
   this question, due to significant discoveries that have emerged as a
   result of intensive DNA-sequencing methods comparing Bd isolates from
   different amphibian species across the globe. Evidence is mounting that
   there is indeed a global panzootic lineage of Bd (BdGPL) in addition to
   what appear to be more localized endemic strains (Fisher etal. 2009;
   James etal. 2009; Farrer etal. 2011). Additionally, BdGPL appears to be
   a hypervirulent strain that has resulted from the hybridization of
   different Bd strains that came into contact in recent decades, and is
   now potentially replacing the less-virulent endemic strains of the
   pathogen (Farrer etal. 2011). In a new study published in this issue of
   Molecular Ecology, Schloegel etal. (2012) identify an additional unique
   Bd lineage that is endemic to the Atlantic Brazilian rainforests
   (Bd-Brazil) and provide striking evidence that the Bd-Brazil lineage has
   sexually recombined with the BdGPL lineage in an area where the two
   lineages likely came into contact as a result of classic
   anthropogenically mediated pathogen pollution(see below). Fungal
   pathogens, including Bd, have the propensity to form recombinant
   lineages when allopatric populations that have not yet formed genetic
   reproductive barriers are provided with opportunities to intermingle,
   and virulent strains may be selected for because they tend to be highly
   transmissible (Fisher etal. 2012). As Schloegel etal. (2012) point out,
   the demonstrated ability for Bd to undergo meiosis may also mean that it
   has the capacity to form a resistant spore stage (as yet undiscovered),
   based on extrapolation from other sexually reproducing chytrids that all
   have spore stages.}},

   The SFG consists of two parts. This document summarizes the steps needed
   and lays out the basic themes for each and a simple approach to follow.
   The second document is the full SFG, publicly available at
   http://sfg.stanford.edu, that includes detailed protocols for data

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Pages = {{27-37}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a method to optimize the environmental performance
   (EP) of agricultural activities, defined as the distance between the
   `environmental' state of a system at a specific time or on a specific
   period and a `high environmental performance' state to reach. Focus is
   on water management at the watershed level with three criteria:
   nitrogen, sediments (water quality) and water yields (water quantity).
   The purpose is to provide a new land-use plan. The originality of the
   method lies in the coupling between an agro-hydrological model, the soil
   and water assessment tool (SWAT), and the goal programming (GP)
   optimization method. Modeling is used to define the initial situation of
   the system and to generate data for the optimization. Goal programming
   is implemented to relocate farming systems in the watershed using a
   binary decision variable.
   The method is implemented on the La Boulouze watershed (South West of
   France). The results are an improvement of the EP, but the `high
   environmental state' is not reached. The main land uses changes are the
   decrease of the sunflower-wheat farming system in favor of the meadows.

Abstract = {{Nearly three-quarters of the genetically modified maize (the insect
   resistant type MON 810, also called Bt maize) produced in the EU are
   cultivated in Spain, where the share of Bt maize cultivation in some
   regions (Catalonia) is very high (above 70\%). In order to ensure
   coexistence with the production of conventional maize and satisfy the
   0.9\% EU threshold for adventitious presence of authorized genetically
   modified (GM) material in conventional (non-GM) maize crops, a set of
   preventive coexistence measures must be applied. These measures usually
   include the setup of large and fixed isolation distances, pollen
   barriers, flowering coincidence, crop rotation and other measures, which
   are very hard to fulfill in a multi-field setting. Basic empirical and
   modeling studies that explore the feasibility of coexistence between GM
   and non-GM crops focus on pair-based interactions between fields while
   multi-field studies build upon them, attempting to consider the
   complexity of gene flow under crop management practices.
   In this study, we use the methodology of relational data mining (which
   can take into account several coexistence measures at the same time) to
   predict gene flow from GM to non-GM maize fields under multi-field crop
   management practices at a local scale. The approach extends the
   pair-based assessments of out-crossing rate by considering all
   neighboring fields within the entire study area, along with the farming
   practices applied to them. The estimation of the out-crossing rates is
   performed by using a PostgreSQL relational database that is analyzed
   with the algorithm TILDE for building relational classification trees.
   In building the trees, TILDE explores the relations describing spatial
   aspects, maize flowering and crop management practices for the 400 ha
   maize oriented production area Pla de Foixa in Catalonia, Spain, in the
   period 2004-2006.
   Our approach proposes a new methodology to predict the level of
   adventitious presence on a multifield setting, where the influence of
   more than one GM field is considered at the same time. The structure of
   the obtained models can be used in the design of coexistence measures of
   the second generation, which should not be used individually but treated
   as synergetic coexistence measures, offering different alternatives to
   achieve a particular coexistence threshold (e.g., 0.9\%, 0.45\%, or
   0.1\%). The possibility to consider multiple measures simultaneously
   makes farmers more flexible in their management decisions as compared to
   the rigid use of isolation distance only, which is currently the most
   commonly recommended coexistence measure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{155}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Many spawning aggregations of marine fishes have been fished beyond the
   point of sustainability, leading to increased calls for protection
   through seasonal and/or site-specific fishery closures. Once a closure
   has been put in place, monitoring the aggregation is imperative in order
   to learn whether protection leads to the recovery of the population.
   Current methods for monitoring the status of spawning aggregations rely
   largely on counts, either subsample or census, usually combined with
   capturing a subset of the fish to assess individual traits such as
   length and weight. Handling fish during the spawning aggregation can be
   stressful for the fish, and can ultimately lead to decreased spawning
   success, increased susceptibility to predators, or increased mortality
   through capture trauma or infection. Here we present a novel analysis
   for monitoring fish on a spawning aggregation that does not require the
   capture and handling of fish. Following a recovering aggregation of
   Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) over seven spawning seasons, we
   show that length-distribution data can be collected by divers using a
   video-based system with parallel lasers calibrated to a specific
   distance apart, and subsequently use those data to monitor changes in
   the size distribution over time. We detected recruitment of new fish to
   the grouper spawning aggregation in the fourth year of monitoring. In
   addition to tracking size distribution trends over time, the length
   distribution information could be combined with an established
   length-weight regression and an estimate of total abundance to estimate
   spawning stock biomass. We qualitatively cross-validate this method with
   census data to evaluate its effectiveness in monitoring the recovery or
   decline of aggregating species that can be visually observed. (C) 2012

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{A novel, yet generic, Bayesian approach to parameter inference in a
   stochastic, spatio-temporal model of dispersal and colonisation is
   developed and applied to the invasion of a region by an alien plant
   species. The method requires species distribution data from multiple
   time points, and accounts for temporal uncertainty in colonisation times
   inherent in such data. Covariates, such as climate parameters, altitude
   and land use, which capture variation in the suitability of sites for
   plant colonisation, are easily incorporated into the model. The method
   assumes no local extinction of occupied sites and thus is primarily
   applicable to modelling distribution data at relatively coarse spatial
   resolutions of plant species whose range is expanding over time. The
   implementation of the model and inference algorithm are illustrated
   through application to British floristic atlas data for the widespread
   alien Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed) assessed at a 10 X 10 km
   resolution in 1970 and 2000. We infer key characteristics of this
   species, predict its future spread, and use the resulting fitted model
   to inform a simulation-based assessment of the methodology. Simulated
   distribution data are used to validate the inference algorithm. Our
   results suggest that the accuracy of inference is not sensitive to the
   number of distribution time points, requiring only that there are at
   least two points in time when distributions are mapped. We demonstrate
   the utility of the modelling approach by making future forecasts and
   historic hindcasts of the distribution of giant hogweed in Great
   Britain. Giant hogweed is one of the worst alien plants in Britain and
   has rapidly increased its range since 1970, yet we highlight that a
   further 20\% of land area remains susceptible to colonisation by this
   species. We use the robustness of this case study to discuss the
   potential for modelling distribution data for other species and at
   different spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense Cardueae, Asteraceae) is one of the
   worst invasive plants world-wide. Native to Eurasia, its unintentional
   introduction into North America now threatens the native flora and is
   responsible for enormous agricultural losses. The goals of this study
   are to: (1) reconstruct the evolutionary history of C. arvense and
   estimate how often it may have colonized North America, (2) compare the
   genetic diversity between European and North American populations to
   detect signs of demographic bottlenecks and/or patterns of population
   admixture, and (3) conduct bioclimatic comparisons to infer eventual
   niche shifts following this species introduction into North America.
   Location Europe and North America. Methods A total of 1522 individuals
   from 58 populations were investigated with six microsatellite markers.
   Estimates of heterozygosity (HE) and allelic richness (RS) were
   quantified for each population, and population structure was inferred
   via analyses of molecular variance (AMOVAs), principal components
   analyses (PCAs), Mantel tests and Bayesian clustering analyses. Climatic
   niche spaces were based on 19 bioclimatic variables extracted from
   approximately 32,000 locations covering the entire range, and compared
   using PCA and hierarchical cluster analysis. Results Although there is
   evidence of multiple introductions from divergent European lineages,
   North American populations of C. arvense exhibited significantly lower
   levels of genetic diversity than their putative ancestors. Bioclimatic
   comparisons pointed to a high degree of niche conservatism during
   invasion, but indicated that genotypes from the former USSR and Central
   European mountain chains were probably best adapted to invade North
   America upon entry into the continent. Main conclusions Genetic and
   historical data suggest that C. arvense first entered North America from
   Western Europe with the first European settlers, and was later
   introduced from Eastern Europe into the prairie states during the

Abstract = {{While oyster mushroom (Pleurotus spp.) is one of the most popular
   cultivated edible mushrooms, there is scanty information about the
   microbial community taking part in mushroom substrate production. In
   this study, an improved sequence-aided terminal restriction fragment
   length polymorphism (T-RFLP) was used to identify and (semi-)quantify
   the dominant bacteria of oyster mushroom substrate preparation. The main
   features of the improved T-RFLP data analysis were the alignment of
   chromatograms with variable clustering thresholds, the visualization of
   data matrix with principal component analysis ordination superimposed
   with cluster analysis, and the search for stage-specific peaks
   (bacterial taxa) with similarity percentage (analysis of similarity)
   analysis, followed by identification with clone libraries. By applying
   this method, the dominance of the following bacterial genera was
   revealed during oyster mushroom substrate preparation: Pseudomonas and
   Sphingomonas at startup, Bacillus, Geobacillus, Ureibacillus,
   Pseudoxanthomonas, and Thermobispora at the end of partial composting,
   and finally several genera of Actinobacteria, Thermus, Bacillus,
   Geobacillus, Thermobacillus, and Ureibacillus in the mature substrate.
   As the proportion of uncultured bacteria increased during the process,
   it is worth establishing strain collections from partial composting and
   from mature substrate for searching new species.}},

Abstract = {{Species invading new ranges are subject to a series of demographic
   events that can strongly shape genetic diversity. Describing this
   demographic history is important for understanding where invasive
   species come from and how they spread, and is critical to testing
   hypotheses of postinvasion adaptation. Here, we analyse nuclear and
   chloroplast genetic diversity to study the invasion history of the
   widespread colonizing weed, Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae). Bayesian
   clustering and PCA revealed strong population structure in the native
   range of Europe, and although genotypes from multiple native sources
   were present in the introduced range of North America, the spatial
   distribution of genetic variance was dramatically reorganized. Using
   approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), we compared support for
   different invasion scenarios, including the number and size of
   independent introduction events and the amount of admixture occurring
   between sources of introduced genotypes. Our results supported
   independent introductions into eastern and western North America, with
   the latter forming a bridgehead for a secondary invasion into the Great
   Lakes region of central North America. Despite small estimated founder
   population sizes, the duration of the demographic bottleneck after the
   initial introduction appeared extremely short-lived. This pattern of
   repeated colonization and rapid expansion has effectively eroded the
   strong population structure and cytonuclear associations present in
   Europe, but has retained overall high genetic diversity since invasion.
   Our results highlight the flexibility of the ABC approach for
   constructing a narrative of the demographic history of species invasions
   and provide baseline for future studies of evolutionary changes in
   introduced S. latifolia populations.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between species diversity and environmental parameters

   To redress this, cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) DNA sequences were
   used to estimate species diversity and to compare phoxocephalid amphipod
   assemblages among 20 stations encompassing a range of environmental
   conditions. Two regions, east (Chatham Rise) and west (Challenger
   Plateau) of New Zealand were sampled to depths of 2001200 m with an
   epibenthic sled. Using a comparison among identified morphospecies, we
   found a clear gap in sequence divergences between 6\% and 13\% and used
   a 6\% threshold to designate molecular operational taxonomic units
   (MOTUs), as a surrogate to putative species. DNA sequences (n = 297)
   revealed high total diversity (n = 49 MOTUs), as well as high beta
   diversity (28 MOTUs found at single location only). Novel phoxocephalid
   MOTUs were found at most stations, especially on Challenger Plateau and
   the flanks of Chatham Rise. Analyses of interstation assemblages
   revealed a major split between regions, indicating minimal overlap in
   taxon distributions. A cluster of highly similar stations was
   identified, broadly distributed over the crest of Chatham Rise, in
   association with elevated food availability, probably resulting from
   higher surface productivity and relatively shallow depth. Accordingly,
   multivariate analysis revealed a strong correlation between
   phoxocephalid assemblages and food supply. This study highlights the

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{39-53}},

Abstract = {{This study develops an approach to mapping indicators of the potential
   of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services, and the impact of changes in
   land cover and use upon them. The study focuses on the EU-25 plus
   Switzerland and Norway, and develops the methodology proposed by Kienast
   et al. (2009), which uses expert-and literature-driven modelling
   methods. The methods are explored in relation to mapping and assessing
   four of the ecosystem services: ``Crop-based production{''}; ``Wildlife
   products{''}; ``Habitat diversity{''}; and ``Recreation{''}. The
   potential to deliver services is assumed to be influenced by (a)
   land-use, (b) net primary production, and (c) bioclimatic and landscape
   properties such as mountainous terrain, adjacency to coastal and wetland
   ecosystems, as well as adjacency to landscape and nature protection
   zones.
   The novel aspect of this work is an analysis of whether the historical
   and the projected land use changes for the periods 1990-2000,2000-2006,
   and 2000-2030 are likely to be supportive or degenerative in the
   capacity of ecosystems to deliver ecosystem services; we refer to these
   as `marginal' or incremental changes. The latter are assessed by using
   land account data for 1990-2000 and 2000-2006 (LEAC, EEA, 2006) and
   EURURALIS 2.0 land use scenarios for 2000-2030. The results are reported
   at three spatial reporting units, i.e. (1) the NUTS-X regions, (2) the
   bioclimatic regions, and (3) the dominant landscape types. All mapped
   output has been compared with independently generated continent-wide
   assessments (maps of ecosystem services or environmental
   parameters/indicators), which revealed that the straightforward binary
   links work satisfactorily and generate plausible geographical patterns.
   This conclusion mainly holds for provisioning services. At the
   continental scale, the selected input parameters are thus valid proxies
   which can be used to assess the medium-term potential of landscapes to
   provide ecosystem services.
   For a subset of NUTS-x regions for which change trajectories for
   1990-2000,2000-2006 and 2000-2030 are available, trade-offs between the
   four services have been analyzed using cluster analyses. The latter
   allowed us to simultaneously analyze the state of the four services in
   year 2000 and the individual trajectories of each service over three
   time periods. As a result we obtained seven regions with distinct
   trade-off patterns. To our knowledge this is one of the first
   continental-wide analyses where and use trajectories are taken into
   account to construct an indicator to estimate the balance between a set
   or bundle of ecosystem services. The relationship between the outputs of
   this work and the development of rapid assessment and accounting
   frameworks is discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ticks (Ixodidae)are important vectors of pathogens that affect humans,
   and methods to reduce impacts of vector-borne pathogens usually involve
   tick control. Improving the efficacy of such methods requires an
   understanding of climate-host-parasite-landscape interactions which is
   difficult to obtain from empirical observations alone. We developed a
   spatially explicit, individual-/agent-based, stochastic model that can
   simulate the spatial-temporal dynamics of ticks in response to changes
   in climatic conditions, landscape structure, and host community
   composition. As a case study, we parameterized the model to represent
   the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum (L)) under ecological
   conditions typical of the south-central United States. We evaluated
   general model performance and examined model sensitivity to broad
   changes in climatic conditions, landscape structure, and host community
   composition, and then demonstrated application of the model by
   simulating the effect of a hypothetical greenbelt placed within a real
   landscape near Houston, Texas, USA on the exposure of humans to ticks.
   The model generated appropriate trends in densities of ticks in both
   off-host and on-host life stages in response to typical seasonal changes
   in densities of small-, medium-, and large-sized hosts, and mean numbers
   of ticks in each life stage on each size of host were appropriate given
   the seasonal progression of the tick life cycle. Simulated tick
   populations also responded appropriately to broad changes in climate,
   landscape structure, and host community composition. Simulated tick
   densities increased within the greenbelt soon after its establishment,
   and densities of off-host larvae, nymphs, and adults all were
   significantly higher in a small meadow (the ``park{''}) with versus
   without the greenbelt: without greenbelt, the park was completely
   surrounded by urban development. Our model should prove useful in
   exploring the role of host community characteristics in the maintenance
   of tick populations, and associated vector-borne diseases, in nature and
   in evaluating the potential efficacy of novel methods of tick control.

Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Ecological network analysis measures such as cycling index, indirect
   effects, and storage analysis provide insightful information on
   ecosystem organization and function, which can be extremely useful for
   environmental management and control. These system-wide measures focus
   on indirect relations among system compartments, providing a holistic
   approach. Unfortunately, the application of these useful measures are
   restricted to steady state models. Seasonal changes, environmental
   impacts, and climate shifts are not accommodated by the current
   methodology, which greatly limits their application. The novel
   methodology introduced in this paper extends the application of these
   useful but limited measures to dynamic compartmental models. This method
   relies on network particle tracking simulation, which is an agent based
   algorithm, whereas the current methods utilize steady-state flow rates
   and compartment storage values. We apply this new methodology to storage
   analysis, which quantifies how much storage is generated at any
   compartment within the system by a unit external input into another
   compartment. Also called compartmental mean residence time, this measure
   is widely used in environmental sciences, pharmacokinetics and
   nutrition, to assess the interaction between system boundary (e.g. drug
   intake, pollution, feeding) and internal compartments (e.g. tissues,
   crops, species). Storage analysis is chosen for demonstration because it
   is applicable to a limited class of dynamic models (linear and
   donor-controlled), which gives us an opportunity to verify our new
   method. The methodology introduced here is also applicable to Finn's

   lethal human rabies outbreaks transmitted by this species are

   driving rabies virus (RV) transmission in vampire bats, we conducted a
   longitudinal capture-recapture study in 20 vampire bat colonies spanning
   four regions of Peru. Serology demonstrated the circulation of RV in
   vampire bats from all regions in all years. Seroprevalence ranged from 3
   to 28 per cent and was highest in juvenile and sub-adult bats. RV
   exposure was independent of bat colony size, consistent with an absence

   Culling campaigns implemented during our study failed to reduce
   seroprevalence and were perhaps counterproductive for disease control
   owing to the targeted removal of adults, but potentially greater
   importance of juvenile and sub-adult bats for transmission. These

Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{729-742}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Evolutionary changes in natural populations can occur on
   ecological time scales. Investigators have become very interested in
   characterizing short-term fluctuations in selection pressure, in
   identifying the circumstances under which the opportunity for selection
   is greatest, and in determining whether this opportunity is realized.
   Aims: Introduce a new metric to explore how the opportunity for
   selection on the mean of a phenotypic character varies with time. Using
   data from two long-term studies of marked individuals, examine how the
   opportunity for and the selection on a character mean and variance
   covary with population growth.
   Metrics: The traditional opportunity for selection metric (OS) is
   defined as the variance in relative fitness or the variation in absolute
   fitness divided by the square of the mean absolute fitness. This metric
   might not be appropriate to evaluate the maximum selection acting on a
   quantitative character because individual variation in both quantitative
   characters and in fitness underpins evolution by natural selection. We
   therefore develop a new metric, the opportunity for selection on a
   quantitative character (OSM), which considers variation in both
   character and fitness distributions.
   Methods: Determine selection, OS, and OSM, in both simulated and
   empirical data. Compare the results for the traditional OS metric with
   the new OSM.
   Results: The classical measure of the OS correlates with the OSM when
   calculated on simulated data but their association was curvilinear for
   non-normally distributed fitness components. Similar results were found
   for empirical data but their correlations were lower. Selection is
   strongest in declining populations and is greatest when the OSM is
   large, as in harsh environments.
   Conclusions: Because most fitness components are non-normally
   distributed, OS will only approximately capture the maximum possible
   selection differential on phenotypic characters over a time step. The
   OSM should be a more useful metric for determining how selection will
   alter the distribution of characters.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment increases the supply ratio of N and P
   to aquatic ecosystems and can affect the identity of the limiting
   nutrient. Here we focus on how stream communities change along gradients
   of N and P supply and stream catchment landuse intensity. We used a
   survey approach in 41 southern New Zealand tributaries to investigate
   how much changes in water N and P concentrations are reflected in
   periphyton C:nutrient ratios (C:N or C:P) and how much food quality
   (high food quality corresponds to low periphyton C:nutrient) is
   reflected in the abundance and taxonomic richness of benthic
   invertebrate primary and secondary consumers. We measured streamwater
   nutrient state, periphyton nutrient ratios, biomass (as chlorophyll a in
   mu g/cm(2)), algal taxon richness, and macroinvertebrate abundance,
   taxonomic composition, and richness. We also estimated stream habitat
   and catchment characteristics, such as current velocity, shading,
   substrate, geology, and landuse intensity. We calculated the Akaike
   information criterion (AIC) for each possible multiple linear regression
   model to select the best predictive models for each response variable.
   C:nutrient ratios were more strongly negatively related to water-column
   N than P availability. Neither N nor P availability covaried with
   periphyton biomass. Lower periphyton C:N partly explained higher grazer,
   but not predator, abundance. Increased \% runoff from pasture and
   periphyton N:P co-occurred with a decrease in invertebrate taxon
   richness. For example, a 4x increase in periphyton N:P was related to
   the loss of similar to 1/2 of invertebrate species, but with high
   uncertainty (R-2 = 0.13). We conclude landuse intensity affects these
   southern New Zealand streams, and these effects are mediated by
   agricultural N runoff into streams (among other factors). Further shifts
   toward high-intensity farming within stream catchments may lead to
   losses of benthic species at all trophic levels.}},

Abstract = {{Remotely sensed observations of rangelands provide a synoptic view of
   vegetation condition unavailable from other means. Multiple satellite
   platforms in operation today (e.g. Landsat, moderate-resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer {[}MODIS]) offer opportunities for regional monitoring
   of rangelands. However, the spatial and temporal variability of
   rangelands pose challenges to consistent and accurate mapping of
   vegetation condition. For instance, soil properties can have a large
   impact on the reflectance registered at the satellite sensor.
   Additionally, senescent vegetation, which is often abundant on
   rangeland, is dynamic and its physical and photochemical properties can
   change rapidly along with moisture availability. Remote sensing has been
   successfully used to map local rangeland conditions. However, regional
   and frequently updated maps of vegetation cover in rangelands are not
   currently available. In this research, we compare ground measurements of
   total vegetation cover, including both green and senescent cover, to
   reflectance observed by the satellite and develop a robust method for
   estimating total vegetation canopy cover over diverse regions of the
   western United States. We test the effects of scaling from ground
   observations up to the Landsat 30-m scale, then to the MODIS 500-m
   scale, and quantify sources of noise. The soil-adjusted total vegetation
   index (SATVI) captures 55\% of the variability in ground measured total
   vegetation cover from diverse sites in New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, and
   Nevada. Scaling from the Landsat to MODIS scale introduces noise and
   loss of spatial detail, but offers inexpensive and frequent observations
   and the ability to track trends in cover over large regions.}},

Abstract = {{In response to climate change and other threatening processes there is
   renewed interest in the role of refugia and refuges. In bioregions that
   experience drought and fire, micro-refuges can play a vital role in
   ensuring the persistence of species. We develop and apply an approach to
   identifying potential micro-refuges based on a time series of remotely
   sensed vegetation greenness (fraction of photosynthetically active
   radiation intercepted by the sunlit canopy; fPAR). The primary data for
   this analysis were NASA MODIS 16-day L3 Global 250 m (MOD13Q1) satellite
   imagery. This method draws upon relevant ecological theory (source sink
   habitats, habitat templet) to calculate a micro-refuge index, which is
   analyzed for each of the major vegetation ecosystems in the case-study
   region (the Great Eastern Ranges of New South Wales, Australia).
   Potential ecosystem greenspots were identified, at a range of
   thresholds, based on an index derived from: the mean and coefficient of
   variance (COV) of fPAR over the 10-year time series; the minimum mean
   annual (PAR; and the COV of the 12 values of mean monthly fPAR. These
   greenspots were mapped and compared with (1) an index of vascular plant
   species composition, (2) environmental variables, and (3) protected
   areas. Potential micro-refuges were found within all vegetation
   ecosystem types. The total area of ecosystem greenspots within the upper
   25\% threshold was 48 406 ha; around 0.2\% of the total area of native
   vegetation (23.9 x 10(6) ha) in the study region. The total area
   affected by fire was 3.4 x 10(6) ha. The results of the environmental
   diagnostic analysis suggest deterministic controls on the geographical
   distribution of potential micro-refuges that may continue to function
   under climate change. The approach is relevant to other regions of the
   world where the role of micro-refuges in the persistence of species is
   recognized, including across the world's arid zones and, in particular,
   for the Australian, southern African, and South American continents.
   Micro-refuge networks may play an important role in maintaining
   beta-diversity at the bio-region scale and contribute to the stability,
   resilience, and adaptive capacity of ecosystems in the face of
   ever-growing pressures from human-forced climate change, land use, and
   other threatening processes.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{When restoring ecosystems dominated by exotic plants, reinvasion
   pressure, or the rate of new exotic recruitment following mature exotic
   removal, can vary broadly between similarly invaded habitats. Reinvasion
   pressure strongly influences restoration costs and outcomes but is
   difficult to predict. Ontogenetic niche shifts (ONSs, changes in niche
   breadth or position during development) in exotic species paired with
   interannual variation in abiotic conditions may decouple pre-removal
   mature exotic density and average reinvasion pressure. Identifying such
   decouplings could improve restoration efficiency by informing site
   selection and management strategies, but requires estimates of average
   reinvasion pressure that mandate greater understanding of its principle
   drivers. We hypothesize that reinvasion pressure is predominantly driven
   by exotic propagule abundance and spatiotemporal availability of
   realized recruitment windows, which are periods of variable duration
   that permit exotic establishment from propagules. Realized recruitment
   windows are based on the safe sites concept but account for ONSs and are
   determined by abiotic conditions and interspecific interactions with
   recipient communities. Biotic resistance or facilitation may increase or
   decrease times required for establishment by influencing exotic growth
   rates or altering niche availability and may permit or preclude
   establishment in marginal abiotic conditions. We discuss factors
   influencing reinvasion pressure, basic approaches to estimate reinvasion
   pressure, and potential ways to increase management efficiency under
   different reinvasion pressure scenarios. Accurate estimates of
   reinvasion pressure could improve restoration efficacy, efficiency, and
   predictability in ecosystems dominated by exotic plants. We argue that
   greater theoretical and practical considerations of reinvasion pressure

Abstract = {{Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is altering biogeochemical cycling
   in forests and interconnected lakes of the northeastern US, and may
   shift nutrient limitation from N toward other essential elements, such
   as phosphorus (P). Whether this shift is occurring relative to N
   deposition gradients across the northeastern US has not been
   investigated. We used datasets for the northeastern US and the
   Adirondack sub-region to evaluate whether P limitation is increasing
   where N deposition is high at two geographic scales, based on N:P mass
   ratios. Using a model-selection approach, we determined that foliar N
   for dominant tree species and lake dissolved inorganic N (DIN) increased
   coincident with increasing N deposition, independent of relationships
   between foliar N or lake DIN and precipitation or temperature. Foliar P
   also increased with N deposition across the northeastern US for seven of
   eight deciduous species, but changed less across the Adirondacks. Foliar
   N:P therefore declined at the highest levels of N deposition for most
   deciduous species across the region (remaining nearly constant for most
   conifers and increasing only for black cherry and hemlock), but
   increased across all species in the Adirondacks. Ratios between DIN and
   total P (DIN:TP) in lakes were unrelated to N deposition regionally but
   increased across the Adirondacks. Thus, nutrient limitation patterns
   shifted from N toward P for dominant trees, and further toward P for
   predominantly P-limited lakes, at the sub-regional but not regional
   scale. For the northeastern US overall, accumulated N deposition may be
   insufficient to drive nutrient limitation from N toward P;
   alternatively, elements other than P (for example, calcium, magnesium)
   may become limiting as N accumulates. The consistent Adirondack foliar
   and lake response could provide early indication of shifts toward P
   limitation within the northeastern US, and together with regional
   patterns, suggests that foliar chemistry could be a predictor of lake
   chemistry in the context of N deposition across the region.}},

Abstract = {{1. Examining the consequences of environmental change for the provision

   Developing these frameworks requires a systematic approach to trait
   selection and addressing the interrelationships among the scale of the
   environmental change, area of ecosystem service provision and the most
   appropriate traits for analysis. 3. We examine key issues in the
   application of trait approaches to vertebrates, drawing specifically on
   the substantial progress made in this area for plants. We argue that
   vertebrate ecologists need to develop more coherent and systematic
   trait-based approaches that are broadly applicable. 4. We present a new
   framework for selecting response and effect traits to link environmental
   change with ecosystem services. An empirical example of each step in the
   framework is provided using birds as a case study, linking the
   environmental change of loss of tree cover with the ecosystem service of
   invertebrate pest regulation in apple orchards. We found that as tree
   cover around orchards increased so did the abundance and foraging rate
   of bird species that pursue invertebrates in flight, and this may help
   reduce the abundance of certain pests of apples (e.g. adult stages of

Abstract = {{Aim We investigated how Pleistocene refugia and recent (c. 12,000 years
   ago) sea level incursions shaped genetic differentiation in mainland and
   island populations of the Scinax perpusillus treefrog group. Location
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest, Sao Paulo state, south-eastern Brazil.
   Methods Using mitochondrial and microsatellite loci, we examined
   population structure and genetic diversity in three species from the S.
   perpusillus group, sampled from three land-bridge islands and five
   mainland populations, in order to understand the roles of Pleistocene
   forest fragmentation and sea level incursions on genetic
   differentiation. We calculated metrics of relatedness and genetic
   diversity to assess whether island populations exhibit signatures of
   genetic drift and isolation. Two of the three island populations in this
   study have previously been described as new species based on a
   combination of distinct morphological and behavioural characters, thus
   we used the molecular datasets to determine whether phenotypic change is
   consistent with genetic differentiation. Results Our analyses recovered
   three distinct lineages or demes composed of northern mainland Sao Paulo
   populations, southern mainland Sao Paulo populations, and one divergent
   island population. The two remaining island populations clustered with
   samples from adjacent mainland populations. Estimates of allelic
   richness were significantly lower, and estimates of relatedness were
   significantly higher, in island populations relative to their mainland
   counterparts. Main conclusions Fine-scale genetic structure across
   mainland populations indicates the possible existence of local refugia
   within Sao Paulo state, underscoring the small geographic scale at which
   populations diverge in this species-rich region of the Atlantic Coastal
   Forest. Variation in genetic signatures across the three islands
   indicates that the populations experienced different demographic
   processes after marine incursions fragmented the distribution of the S.
   perpusillus group. Genetic signatures of inbreeding and drift in some
   island populations indicate that small population sizes, coupled with
   strong ecological selection, may be important evolutionary forces
   driving speciation on land-bridge islands.}},

Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2052-2060}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Globally, fire maintains many mesic habitats in an open canopy state by
   killing woody plants while reducing the size of those able to resprout.
   Where fire is frequent, tree saplings are often suppressed by a ``fire
   trap{''} of repeated topkill (death of aerial biomoass) and resprouting,
   preventing them from reaching adult size. The ability to tolerate
   repeated topkill is an essential life-history trait that allows a
   sapling to persist until it experiences a long fire-free interval,
   during which it can escape the fire trap. We hypothesized that
   persistence in the fire trap results from a curvilinear relationship
   between pre-burn size and resprout size, which causes a plant to
   approach an equilibrial size in which post-fire biomass recovery is
   equal to fire-induced biomass loss. We also predicted that the
   equilibrial stem size is positively related to resource availability. To
   test these hypotheses, we collected data on pre-burn and resprout size
   of five woody plant species at wetland ecotones in longleaf pine savanna
   subjected to frequent burning. As expected, all species exhibited
   similar curvilinear relationships between pre-burn size and resprout
   size. The calculated equilibrial sizes were strong predictors of mean
   plant size across species and growing conditions, supporting the
   persistence equilibrium model. An alternative approach using matrix
   models yielded similar results. Resprouting was less vigorous in dry
   sites than at wet sites, resulting in smaller equilibrial stem sizes in
   drier sites; extrapolating these results provides an explanation for the
   absence of these species in xeric uplands. This new framework offers a
   straightforward approach to guide data collection for experimental,
   comparative, and modeling studies of plant persistence and community
   dynamics in frequently burned habitats.}},

Abstract = {{In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number R-0 is usually defined as
   the average number of new infections caused by a single infective
   individual introduced into a completely susceptible population.
   According to this definition. R-0 is related to the initial stage of the
   spreading of a contagious disease. However, from epidemiological models
   based on ordinary differential equations (ODE), R-0 is commonly derived
   from a linear stability analysis and interpreted as a bifurcation
   parameter: typically, when R-0 >1, the contagious disease tends to
   persist in the population because the endemic stationary solution is
   asymptotically stable: when R-0 <1, the corresponding pathogen tends to
   naturally disappear because the disease-free stationary solution is
   asymptotically stable. Here we intend to answer the following question:
   Do these two different approaches for calculating R-0 give the same
   numerical values? In other words, is the number of secondary infections
   caused by a unique sick individual equal to the threshold obtained from
   stability analysis of steady states of ODE? For finding the answer, we
   use a susceptibleinfective-recovered (SIR) model described in terms of
   ODE and also in terms of a probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA), where
   each individual (corresponding to a cell of the PCA lattice) is
   connected to others by a random network favoring local contacts. The
   values of R-0 obtained from both approaches are compared, showing good
   agreement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{335-349}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recent developments in animal tracking technology have permitted the
   collection of detailed data on the movement paths of individuals from
   many species. However, analysis methods for these data have not
   developed at a similar pace, largely due to a lack of suitable candidate
   models, coupled with the technical difficulties of fitting such models
   to data. To facilitate a general modeling framework, we propose that
   complex movement paths can be conceived as a series of movement
   strategies among which animals transition as they are affected by
   changes in their internal and external environment. We synthesize
   previously existing and novel methodologies to develop a general suite
   of mechanistic models based on biased and correlated random walks that
   allow different behavioral states for directed (e.g., migration),
   exploratory (e.g., dispersal), area-restricted (e.g., foraging), and
   other types of movement. Using this ``toolbox'' of nested model
   components, multistate movement models may be custom-built for a wide
   variety of species and applications. As a unified state-space modeling
   framework, it allows the simultaneous investigation of numerous
   hypotheses about animal movement from imperfectly observed data,
   including time allocations to different movement behavior states,
   transitions between states, the use of memory or navigation, and
   strengths of attraction (or repulsion) to specific locations. The
   inclusion of covariate information permits further investigation of
   specific hypotheses related to factors driving different types of
   movement behavior. Using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo
   methods to facilitate Bayesian model selection and multi-model
   inference, we apply the proposed methodology to real data by adapting it
   to the natural history of the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) in the
   North Sea. Although previous grey seal studies tended to focus on
   correlated movements, we found overwhelming evidence that bias toward
   haul-out or foraging locations better explained seal movement than did
   simple or correlated random walks. Posterior model probabilities also
   provided evidence that seals transition among directed, area-restricted,
   and exploratory movements associated with haul-out, foraging, and other
   behaviors. With this intuitive framework for modeling and interpreting
   animal movement, we believe that the development and application of
   custom-made movement models will become more accessible to ecologists
   and non-statisticians.}},

Abstract = {{1. Tracking insect migration at continental scales is intractable using
   exogenous markers because of tiny body size and high improbability of
   recapture. Naturally occurring endogenous isotopic markers, such as
   tissue d2H and d18O, are a means of assigning origins to both vertebrate
   and invertebrate populations, but the success depends upon derivation of
   a robust algorithm linking measured tissue isotope values with
   large-scale geospatial isotopic patterns (isoscapes) in the terrestrial
   hydrosphere. 2. We derived a North American dragonfly wing d2H and d18O
   isoscape from known-origin dragonflies of three species (Aeshna
   interrupta, Aeshna umbrosa and Pachydiplax longipennis) obtained across
   North America. A strong relationship (r2 = 0.75) was found between wing
   d2H and hydrologic geospatial d2H patterns, and between wing d2H and
   d18O (r2 = 0.92). The strong coupling between emergent insect tissue and
   hydrologic spatial patterning suggested that this dragonfly isoscape may
   be applicable to other aquatic emergent migratory insects in North
   America and elsewhere. 3. As a proof of concept, we used the wing
   isoscape algorithm to map the probability of natal origin of Common
   Green Darners (Anax junius) migrating through southern Texas. Results
   showed that these Texan dragonflies were a mix of local and far-distant
   migrant (e.g. northern United States) individuals. We suggest that this
   isoscape algorithm opens new opportunities to quantify the migration and
   natal origins of dragonflies and other aquatic emergent insects where
   conventional methods have failed.}},

Abstract = {{The paper explores the role of natural resource accounting and
   calculations as tools for inducing movement towards ecologically sound
   policy making. We draw from the theoretical debates in social studies of
   science and technology (STS) to understand how calculations gain their
   power in real-world decision-making. Through in-depth case analysis of a
   local energy production decision in Finland, we study how and under what
   conditions calculative methods related to environmental valuation affect
   the rationalities applied in policy decisions. On the basis of our
   analysis, we claim that new calculative rationalities do not become
   significant through changing ways of thinking alone. There is a need for
   shift of calculative framing. This shift requires active promotion by
   powerful actors and furthermore, new framings need to become embedded in
   the rules of the game of decision making. Our analysis suggests that the
   methods of STS can provide a valuable tool for economists' creation of
   richer understanding of the dynamics between calculative rationalities
   and the institutions of decision-making. In-depth case analysis of
   decision making involving the use of natural resources brings out the
   multitude of ways in which calculations can take part in or be excluded

Abstract = {{In many coastal areas, marine ecosystems have shifted into contrasting
   states having reduced ecosystem services (hereafter called degraded).
   Such degraded ecosystems may be slow to revert to their original state
   due to new ecological feedbacks that reinforce the degraded state. A
   better understanding of the way human actions influence the strength and
   direction of feedbacks, how different feedbacks could interact, and at
   what scales they operate, may be necessary in some cases for successful
   management of marine ecosystems. Here we synthesize interactions of
   critical feedbacks of the degraded states from six globally distinct
   biomes: coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass beds, shallow soft
   sediments, oyster reefs, and coastal pelagic food webs. We explore to
   what extent current management captures these feedbacks and propose
   strategies for how and when (that is, windows of opportunity) to
   influence feedbacks in ways to break the resilience of the degraded
   ecosystem states. We conclude by proposing some challenges for future
   research that could improve our understanding of these issues and
   emphasize that management of degraded marine states will require a broad

Abstract = {{Ecosystems across the globe are threatened by climate change and human

   would greatly advance assessment and understanding of these threats.
   Taking advantage of next-generation DNA sequencing, we tested an
   approach we call metabarcoding: high-throughput and simultaneous taxa
   identification based on a very short (usually <100 base pairs) but
   informative DNA fragment. Short DNA fragments allow the use of degraded
   DNA from environmental samples. All analyses included amplification
   using plant-specific versatile primers, sequencing and estimation of
   taxonomic diversity. We tested in three steps whether degraded DNA from
   dead material in soil has the potential of efficiently assessing
   biodiversity in different biomes. First, soil DNA from eight boreal
   plant communities located in two different vegetation types (meadow and
   heath) was amplified. Plant diversity detected from boreal soil was
   highly consistent with plant taxonomic and growth form diversity
   estimated from conventional above-ground surveys. Second, we assessed
   DNA persistence using samples from formerly cultivated soils in
   temperate environments. We found that the number of crop DNA sequences
   retrieved strongly varied with years since last cultivation, and crop
   sequences were absent from nearby, uncultivated plots. Third, we
   assessed the universal applicability of DNA metabarcoding using soil
   samples from tropical environments: a large proportion of species and

   open unprecedented opportunities for large-scale DNA-based biodiversity

Abstract = {{Much evidence is accumulating that insect distributions are changing.
   The changing earth's climate is providing mobile species with an
   evolving ``hospitability{''} template, and increasing global commerce
   expands opportunities for mobile species to colonize new habitats.
   Predicting the distribution of insects in the face of accelerating
   global commerce and climate change is quite a challenge. Many fruitful
   approaches are available and are being improved. Some are correlative;
   some are based on process-level knowledge. We have focused on an
   eco-physiological approach based on the known responses of species to
   specific weather factors at the physiological level. Of particular
   importance are developmental responses, of course, as they determine
   climates under which an insect can achieve a stable, adaptive
   seasonality. With this underlying minimal requirement, models can also
   take into account other weather influences such as cold tolerance and
   the deleterious effects of too much heat. In this paper, we illustrated
   the use of this approach to predict the change of distribution and
   potential impacts of the spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana
   (Clem.), a major native insect pest of conifer forests in North America.
   Like previous work on the invasive gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) and
   the native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins), the
   present work points to the following conclusions concerning the effects
   of global warming on species distributions: (1) they will shift towards
   the poles (and to higher elevations); (2) temperate regions will bear
   the brunt of these shifts; and (3) distribution shifts may be good or
   bad, depending on the species and the regions concerned.}},

   Methods We compared a new analysis of satellite tree cover data with
   botanical, phytogeographical and environmental data. Results Along the

   according to their average tree cover, which can co-occur as mosaics.
   The resulting abrupt shifts in tree cover were not correlated to any
   shifts in either environmental variables or in tree species

   fine-scale variability in tree cover and coarse-scale structural states
   that are stable over several degrees of latitude. While climate
   parameters and species pools display a continuous evolution along the
   climatic gradient, these stable structural states have discontinuous
   transitions, resulting in regions containing mosaics of alternative
   stable states. Soils appear to have little effect inside the climatic
   stable state domains but a strong action on the location of the

Abstract = {{Aim Across all latitudes, high-elevation tree lines represent a drastic
   change in the dominant plant life-form, from upright trees to
   low-stature alpine plants. Although associated with low temperatures,
   the physiological mechanisms controlling this boundary are still not
   clear. The growth-limitation hypothesis assumes a direct low-temperature
   restriction of tissue formation at otherwise sufficient
   photoassimilation. In order to test this hypothesis, we present a global
   synthesis of previously published and new data on tree carbon supply
   status at high-elevation tree lines. Location Global; 13 regions between
   68 degrees N and 45 degrees S. Methods Late-season concentrations of
   non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in foliage and branch wood were
   measured at three elevations across the tree line ecotones, from upper
   tall forests (timber line) to the edges of aborescent tree growth (tree
   line). Year-round records of -10 cm soil temperatures were taken at the
   tree line. Results Despite large differences in elevation and season
   length, the mean growing season temperature at the tree line was similar
   (approximately 6.6 degrees C) between all sites. NSC concentrations were
   not depleted at any of the elevation gradients between timber line and
   tree line, indicating no shortage of C at the uppermost tree stands.
   Tested across all sites, NSC concentrations in fact significantly
   increased with elevation. On average, NSC increased by 18\% in leaves
   and 26\% in branch wood from the lowest to the highest stands, primarily
   due to higher starch concentrations rather than free sugars. Hence,
   these responses do not reflect osmotic adjustments to lower temperatures
   at the end of the growing season. Main conclusions This global data set
   contributes to a mechanistic understanding of tree line formation based
   on biological principles across climatic zones and tree genera. No
   evidence of C shortage was found at the high-elevation tree line in
   either seasonal and non-seasonal regions. The increasing trend of NSC
   concentrations with elevation is in line with the growth-limitation

Abstract = {{Conservation management can no longer rely on protecting pristine
   habitats, but must consider the wider landscape. This is especially true
   on oceanic islands where endemic species are believed to be particularly
   susceptible to the extinction risks that accompany land conversion.
   Despite this, there is a paucity of studies examining how endemic
   communities on oceanic islands may be distributed across such
   human-modified habitats. Taking Principe Island in West Africa as a case
   study, we investigate how avian communities vary across the habitats
   (primary forest, secondary forest, agricultural areas) of this globally
   important centre of endemism. Here, recent policy reforms aimed at
   poverty alleviation and increased food production are rapidly altering
   the current land-use mosaic. Across all habitats, 27 bird species were
   encountered. Survey points in secondary forest and agricultural areas
   were, on average, more diverse and held higher overall abundances of
   birds than those within primary forest. This was true for both the
   entire avian assemblage and the endemic species alone. Nevertheless, two
   IUCN-listed species were restricted to primary forest, and many other
   endemics occurred at higher densities within this habitat. We
   demonstrate that agricultural areas and novel habitats, such as
   secondary forest, can hold high abundances of endemic species and thus
   have the potential to act as a resource for biodiversity conservation. A
   double-stranded approach to conservation is therefore required that both
   protects the integrity of the primary forest and controls the rapid
   changes in agricultural land-use to ensure that it continues to support
   a large component of the endemic avifauna. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{Variation in diversification rates is often studied by investigating
   traits related to species' ecology and life history. Often, however, it
   is unknown whether these traits evolve gradually or in punctuated bursts
   during speciation. Using phylogenetic data and species' present-day
   trait information, we present a novel approach to assessing the mode of
   character change while accounting for trait-dependent speciation and
   extinction. Our model, ``Binary-State Speciation and Extinction-node
   enhanced state shift{''} (BiSSE-ness), estimates both the rate of change
   occurring along lineages and the probability of change occurring during
   speciation, as well as independent speciation and extinction rates for
   each character state. Using simulations, we found that BiSSE-ness is
   able to distinguish along-lineage and speciational change and accurately
   estimate the parameters associated with character change and
   diversification rates. We applied BiSSE-ness to an empirical primate
   data set and found evidence for along-lineage changes in primate mating
   systems and social behaviors, whereas shifts in habitat were associated
   with speciation. In cases where trait changes may be linked to the
   speciation process itself (e. g., niche-related traits), BiSSE-ness
   provides a suitable framework with which to simultaneously address
   questions regarding species diversification and character change.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Structural equation modeling (SEM) is increasingly being chosen by
   researchers as a framework for gaining scientific insights from the
   quantitative analyses of data. New ideas and methods emerging from the
   study of causality, influences from the field of graphical modeling, and
   advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability, and even
   purpose of SEM. Guidelines for implementing the expanded capabilities of
   SEM are currently lacking. In this paper we describe new developments in
   SEM that we believe constitute a third-generation of the methodology.
   Most characteristic of this new approach is the generalization of the
   structural equation model as a causal graph. In this generalization,
   analyses are based on graph theoretic principles rather than analyses of
   matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels and causal diagrams, as
   well as an increased emphasis on queries and probabilistic reasoning,
   are now included. Estimation under a graph theory framework permits the
   use of Bayesian or likelihood methods. The guidelines presented start
   from a declaration of the goals of the analysis. We then discuss how
   theory frames the modeling process, requirements for causal
   interpretation, model specification choices, selection of estimation
   method, model evaluation options, and use of queries, both to summarize
   retrospective results and for prospective analyses.
   The illustrative example presented involves monitoring data from
   wetlands on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia National Park. Our
   presentation walks through the decision process involved in developing
   and evaluating models, as well as drawing inferences from the resulting
   prediction equations. In addition to evaluating hypotheses about the
   connections between human activities and biotic responses, we illustrate
   how the structural equation (SE) model can be queried to understand how
   interventions might take advantage of an environmental threshold to
   limit Typha invasions.
   The guidelines presented provide for an updated definition of the SEM
   process that subsumes the historical matrix approach under a
   graph-theory implementation. The implementation is also designed to
   permit complex specifications and to be compatible with various
   estimation methods. Finally, they are meant to foster the use of
   probabilistic reasoning in both retrospective and prospective
   considerations of the quantitative implications of the results.}},

Abstract = {{Climatic changes, including altered precipitation regimes, will affect
   key ecosystem processes, such as plant productivity and biodiversity for
   many terrestrial ecosystems. Past and ongoing precipitation experiments
   have been conducted to quantify these potential changes. An analysis of
   these experiments indicates that they have provided important
   information on how water regulates ecosystem processes. However, they do
   not adequately represent global biomes nor forecasted precipitation
   scenarios and their potential contribution to advance our understanding
   of ecosystem responses to precipitation changes is therefore limited, as
   is their potential value for the development and testing of ecosystem
   models. This highlights the need for new precipitation experiments in
   biomes and ambient climatic conditions hitherto poorly studied applying
   relevant complex scenarios including changes in precipitation frequency
   and amplitude, seasonality, extremity and interactions with other global
   change drivers. A systematic and holistic approach to investigate how
   soil and plant community characteristics change with altered
   precipitation regimes and the consequent effects on ecosystem processes
   and functioning within these experiments will greatly increase their
   value to the climate change and ecosystem research communities.
   Experiments should specifically test how changes in precipitation
   leading to exceedance of biological thresholds affect ecosystem
   resilience and acclimation.}},

Title = {{TurbSeed-A model for wind dispersal of seeds in turbulent currents based

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{237}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{A numerical model (TurbSeed) is described which calculates explicitly
   the dispersal of plant seeds by wind, especially the fraction of seeds,
   which are transported more than 100 m starting at the inflorescence.
   Such rare events are called here long-distance dispersal. The framework
   of TurbSeed includes three main modules:
   (1) A turbulence model (TM) for a specified location and time period
   using meteorological parameters from publicly available mesoscale
   weather models or simulated climate data.
   (2) A Lagrangian model (LM) which calculates the seed transport in the
   turbulent boundary layer and
   (3) A module which considers the effect of weather conditions on release
   of seeds (RS).
   In this approach the turbulent field is prescribed by a coarse wind
   field derived from the mesoscale climate simulations superimposed by a
   random velocity component. Similar approaches are known as
   Eulerian-Lagrangian approaches.The main difference in this new approach
   (TM) lies in the construction of the turbulent structure of the wind
   field. The introduction of such a random velocity component uses the
   Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. An inverse random phase
   Fast-Fourier-Transformation reconstructs the time structure of
   turbulence using a parameterized power spectrum of turbulence which is
   accepted as standard in micro meteorology.
   In the LM module Monte-Carlo-Simulations for numerous trajectories are
   used to incorporate the effects of turbulence. The RS module takes into
   account various conditions of release of plant seeds, such as the date
   of maturity of the seeds and the effect of wind speed on the release of
   seeds.
   This model can be driven not only with data from observed weather
   conditions, but also with output of mesoscale climate scenarios. Thus.
   TurbSeed can study the effect of climate change on wind dispersal of
   seeds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Is the coexistence of a continuum of species or ecological
   types possible in real-world communities? Or should one expect
   distinctly different species?
   Mathematical methods: We study whether the coexistence of species in a
   continuum of ecological types is (a) dynamically stable (against changes
   in population densities) and (b) structurally robust (against changes in
   population dynamics). Since most of the reviewed investigations are
   based on Lotka-Volterra models, we carefully explain which of the
   presented conclusions are model-independent.
   Mathematical conclusions: Seemingly plausible models with dynamically
   stable continuous-coexistence solutions do exist. However, these models
   either depend on biologically unrealistic mathematical assumptions (e.g.
   non-differentiable ingredient functions) or are structurally unstable
   (i.e. destroyable by arbitrarily small modifications to those ingredient
   functions). The dynamical stability of a continuous-coexistence
   solution, if it exists, requires positive definiteness of the model's
   competition kernel.
   Biological conclusions: While the classical expectation of fixed limits
   to similarity is mathematically naive, the fundamental discreteness of
   species is a natural consequence of the basic structure of ecological
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Why, in a globally warming climate, have observed rates of atmospheric
   evaporative demand (AED) declined at many sites over recent decades? The
   answer is that the evaporative process is primarily driven by radiative
   and aerodynamic components (the latter mainly influenced by wind speed
   and atmospheric humidity). So, although increases in air temperatures in
   isolation would result in increases of both pan evaporation (Epan)
   observations, and fully physically based model estimates of potential
   evapotranspiration (ETp), results show that changes in the other
   meteorological variables governing AED are currently exerting a greater
   opposing influence. Widespread declines in wind speed (denoted stilling)
   of similar to-0.014?m?s-1?a-1 have recently been reported. In studies
   assessing the relative contribution of the four primary meteorological
   variables on AED dynamics, wind speed trends are often indentified as
   being important. Stilling reduces AED, but its impact on actual
   evapotranspiration and streamflow is situation dependant. For wet
   catchments under steady state conditions, stilling-induced declines in
   actual evapotranspiration will result in an approximate complementary
   increase in streamflow. In contrast, for dry catchments, actual
   evapotranspiration dynamics more closely follow precipitation dynamics
   so stilling has negligible impact on streamflow. In equitant catchments
   (i.e. those that straddle the energywater limitation divide), the likely
   impact of stilling on the catchment water balance depends on sub-annual
   processes and requires that new approaches (either topdown or bottomup)
   be developed to allow better predictions to be made. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{During the 21st century, climate-driven changes in fire regimes will be
   a key agent of change in forests of the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW).
   Understanding the response of forest carbon (C) dynamics to increases in
   fire will help quantify limits on the contribution of forest C storage
   to climate change mitigation and prioritize forest types for monitoring
   C storage and fire management to minimize C loss. In this study, we used
   projections of 21st century area burned to explore the consequences of
   changes in fire regimes on C dynamics in forests of Washington State. We
   used a novel empirical approach that takes advantage of chronosequences
   of C pools and fluxes and statistical properties of fire regimes to
   explore the effects of shifting age class distributions on C dynamics.
   Forests of the western Cascades are projected to be more sensitive to
   climate-driven increases in fire, and thus projected changes in C
   dynamics, than forests of the eastern Cascades. In the western Cascades,
   mean live biomass C is projected to decrease by 24-37\%, and coarse
   woody debris (CWD) biomass C by 15-25\% for the 2040s. Loss of live
   biomass C is projected to be lower for forests of the eastern Cascades
   and Okanogan Highlands (17-26\%), and CWD biomass is projected to
   increase. Landscape mean net primary productivity is projected to
   increase in wet low-elevation forests of the western Cascades, but
   decrease elsewhere. These forests, and moist forests of the Okanogan
   Highlands, are projected to have the greatest percentage increases in
   consumption of live biomass. Percentage increases in consumption of CWD
   biomass are greater than 50\% for all regions and up to four times
   greater than increases in consumption of live biomass. Carbon
   sequestration in PNW forests will be highly sensitive to increases in
   fire, suggesting a cautious approach to managing these forests for C
   sequestration to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1701-1710}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Persistence of species in fragmented landscapes depends on dispersal
   among suitable breeding sites, and dispersal is often influenced by the
   ``matrix{''} habitats that lie between breeding sites. However,
   measuring effects of different matrix habitats on movement and
   incorporating those differences into spatially explicit models to
   predict dispersal is costly in terms of time and financial resources.
   Hence a key question for conservation managers is: Do more costly,
   complex movement models yield more accurate dispersal predictions? We
   compared the abilities of a range of movement models, from simple to
   complex, to predict the dispersal of an endangered butterfly, the Saint
   Francis' satyr (Neonympha mitchellii francisci). The value of more
   complex models differed depending on how value was assessed. Although
   the most complex model, based on detailed movement behaviors, best
   predicted observed dispersal rates, it was only slightly better than the
   simplest model, which was based solely on distance between sites.
   Consequently, a parsimony approach using information criteria favors the
   simplest model we examined. However, when we applied the models to a
   larger landscape that included proposed habitat restoration sites, in
   which the composition of the matrix was different than the matrix
   surrounding extant breeding sites, the simplest model failed to identify
   a potentially important dispersal barrier, open habitat that butterflies
   rarely enter, which may completely isolate some of the proposed
   restoration sites from other breeding sites. Finally, we found that,
   although the gain in predicting dispersal with increasing model
   complexity was small, so was the increase in financial cost.
   Furthermore, a greater fit continued to accrue with greater financial
   cost, and more complex models made substantially different predictions
   than simple models when applied to a novel landscape in which
   butterflies are to be reintroduced to bolster their populations. This
   suggests that more complex models might be justifiable on financial
   grounds. Our results caution against a pure parsimony approach to
   deciding how complex movement models need to be to accurately predict
   dispersal through the matrix, especially if the models are to be applied
   to novel or modified landscapes.}},

Volume = {{81}},

Pages = {{738-746}},

Abstract = {{1. The recently developed Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) has
   advantages over traditional methods because it quantifies the
   utilization distribution of an animal based on its movement path rather
   than individual points and accounts for temporal autocorrelation and
   high data volumes. However, the BBMM assumes unrealistic homogeneous
   movement behaviour across all data. 2. Accurate quantification of the
   utilization distribution is important for identifying the way animals
   use the landscape. 3. We improve the BBMM by allowing for changes in
   behaviour, using likelihood statistics to determine change points along
   the animal's movement path. 4. This novel extension, outperforms the
   current BBMM as indicated by simulations and examples of a territorial
   mammal and a migratory bird. The unique ability of our model to work
   with tracks that are not sampled regularly is especially important for
   GPS tags that have frequent failed fixes or dynamic sampling schedules.
   Moreover, our model extension provides a useful one-dimensional measure
   of behavioural change along animal tracks. 5. This new method provides a
   more accurate utilization distribution that better describes the space
   use of realistic, behaviourally heterogeneous tracks.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The family Rutaceae (rue family) is the largest within the eudicot
   order Sapindales and is distributed mainly in the tropical and
   subtropical regions of both the New World and the Old World, with a few
   genera in temperate zones. The main objective of this study is to
   present molecular dating and biogeographical analyses of the subfamily
   Spathelioideae, the earliest branching clade (which includes eight
   extant genera), to interpret the temporal and spatial origins of this
   group, ascertaining possible vicariant patterns and dispersal routes and
   inferring diversification rates through time. Location Pantropics.
   Methods A dataset comprising a complete taxon sampling at generic level
   (83.3\% at species level) of Spathelioideae was used for a Bayesian
   molecular dating analysis (beast). Four fossil calibration points and an
   age constraint for Sapindales were applied. An ancestral area
   reconstruction analysis utilizing the dispersalextinctioncladogenesis
   model and diversification rate analyses was conducted. Results Dating
   analyses indicate that Rutaceae and Spathelioideae are probably of Late
   Cretaceous origin, after which Spathelioideae split into a Neotropical
   and a Palaeotropical lineage. The Palaeotropical taxa have their origin
   inferred in Africa, with postulated dispersal events to the
   Mediterranean, the Canary Islands, Madagascar and Southeast Asia. The
   lineages within Spathelioideae evolved at a relatively constant
   diversification rate. However, abrupt changes in diversification rates
   are inferred from the beginning of the Miocene and during the
   Pliocene/Pleistocene. Main conclusions The geographical origin of
   Spathelioideae probably lies in Africa. The existence of a Neotropical
   lineage may be the result of a dispersal event at a time in the Late
   Cretaceous when South America and Africa were still quite close to each
   other (assuming that our age estimates are close to the actual ages), or
   by Gondwanan vicariance (assuming that our age estimates provide minimal
   ages only). Separation of land masses caused by sea level changes during
   the Pliocene and Pleistocene may have been triggers for speciation in

   fossil records were integrated to assess contemporary and historical

   a westward shift in range that occurred in the last 100 k generations.
   Results supported fragmentation of a common ancestor during the Holocene

   conclusions Monophyletic Z. h. luteus reflects fragmentation of a common
   ancestor with recent (Holocene) upslope colonization of disjunct montane
   areas. We refute the hypotheses of in situ divergence or origins from a
   Colorado Piedmont ancestor. Instead, westward colonization from the
   Edwards Plateau during the Wisconsin followed by Holocene fragmentation,
   which serves as a generalized biogeographic hypothesis for species
   associated with mesic graminoid habitats in the American Southwest.
   Further exploration of these signatures using independent nuclear DNA is
   warranted. Key conservation implications are (1) Z. h. luteus is a
   monophyletic lineage on an independent evolutionary trajectory; (2) Z.
   h. luteus shared a recent common ancestor with Z. h. pallidus (not Z. h.

   formation theory. Indeed, vegetation pattern formation has been
   identified with mathematical instabilities of uniform vegetation states,
   occurring at threshold degrees of aridity. This paper describes
   applications of this modelling approach to problems in landscape,
   community, ecosystem and restoration ecology, highlighting new open
   questions and research directions that are motivated by pattern
   formation theory. Three added values of this approach are emphasized:
   (i) the approach reveals universal nonlinear elements for which a great
   deal of knowledge is already available, (ii) it captures important
   aspects of ecosystem complexity, and (iii) it provides an integrative
   framework for studying problems in spatial ecology. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{State water-quality professionals developing new biological assessment
   methods often have difficulty relating assessment results to narrative
   criteria in water-quality standards. An alternative to selecting index
   thresholds arbitrarily is to include the Biological Condition Gradient
   (BCG) in the development of the assessment method. The BCG describes
   tiers of biological community condition to help identify and communicate
   the position of a water body along a gradient of water quality ranging
   from natural to degraded. Although originally developed for fish and
   macroinvertebrate communities of streams and rivers, the BCG is easily
   adapted to other habitats and taxonomic groups. We developed a
   discriminant analysis model with stream algal data to predict attainment
   of tiered aquatic-life uses in Maine's water-quality standards. We
   modified the BCG framework for Maine stream algae, related the BCG tiers
   to Maine's tiered aquatic-life uses, and identified appropriate algal
   metrics for describing BCG tiers. Using a modified Delphi method, 5
   aquatic biologists independently evaluated algal community metrics for
   230 samples from streams and rivers across the state and assigned a BCG
   tier (1-6) and Maine water quality class (AA/A, B, C, nonattainment of
   any class) to each sample. We used minimally disturbed reference sites
   to approximate natural conditions (Tier 1). Biologist class assignments
   were unanimous for 53\% of samples, and 42\% of samples differed by 1
   class. The biologists debated and developed consensus class assignments.
   A linear discriminant model built to replicate a priori class
   assignments correctly classified 95\% of 150 samples in the model
   training set and 91\% of 80 samples in the model validation set. Locally
   derived metrics based on BCG taxon tolerance groupings (e. g.,
   sensitive, intermediate, tolerant) were more effective than were metrics
   developed in other regions. Adding the algal discriminant model to
   Maine's existing macroinvertebrate discriminant model will broaden
   detection of biological impairment and further diagnose sources of
   impairment. The algal discriminant model is specific to Maine, but our
   approach of explicitly tying an assessment tool to tiered aquatic-life
   goals is widely transferrable to other regions, taxonomic groups, and
   waterbody types.}},

Abstract = {{Discharge variability is an important disturbance factor, and its effect
   on macroinvertebrate assemblages has been widely studied in river
   ecosystems. In comparison, few researchers have investigated discharge
   variability in springs because they are thought to be relatively stable
   ecosystems and because discharge is not easy to measure in springs. We
   used the gypsum-dissolution method to assess the discharge regime of 5
   natural perennial springs during a 1-y study. We calculated discharge
   from the mass loss of gypsum spheres at a given temperature after
   calibration of the method in the laboratory. We also collected seasonal
   macroinvertebrate samples during the study period to assess the effect
   of discharge variability on the composition of macroinvertebrate
   assemblages in the springs. The calibration experiments revealed
   significant linear relationships between mass loss and discharge. In the
   field experiments, we were able to differentiate springs with high
   discharge variability from springs with low discharge variability.
   Species richness was highest in springs with highest maximum discharge.
   Seasonal variability in macroinvertebrate assemblages was higher in
   these springs than in springs with low discharge variability. Discharge
   variability (disturbance intensity) did not influence the diversity and
   number of spring specialists. We found no evidence for highest diversity
   at an intermediate level of disturbance as predicted by the intermediate
   disturbance hypothesis. The gypsum dissolution method is an appropriate
   method for assessing short-and medium-term discharge variability in
   springs. The importance of discharge variability as flow-associated
   disturbance is expected to increase in the context of the predicted
   effects of changes in global climate and land use, i.e., increasing
   drought periods and flood events.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies emphasize the role of indirect relationships and feedback
   loops in maintaining ecosystem resilience. Environmental changes that
   impact on the organisms involved in these processes have the potential
   to initiate threshold responses and fundamentally shift the interactions
   within an ecosystem. However, empirical studies are hindered by the
   difficulty of designing appropriate manipulative experiments to capture
   this complexity. Here we employ structural equation modeling to define
   and test the architecture of ecosystem interaction networks. Using
   survey data from 19 estuaries we investigate the interactions between
   biological (abundance of large bioturbating macrofauna,
   micro-phytobenthos, and detrital matter) and physical (sediment grain
   size) processes. We assess the potential for abrupt changes in the
   architecture of the network and the strength of interactions to occur
   across environmental gradients. Our analysis identified a potential
   threshold in the relationship between sediment mud content and benthic
   chlorophyll a, at similar to 12 mu g/g, using quantile regression. Below
   this threshold, the interaction network involved different variables and
   fewer feedbacks than above. This approach has potential to improve our
   empirical understanding of thresholds in ecological systems and our
   ability to design manipulative experiments that test how and when a
   threshold will be passed. It can also be used to indicate to resource
   managers that a particular system has the potential to exhibit threshold

Abstract = {{This study focuses on potential impacts of 21st century climate change
   on vegetation in the Southwest United States, based on debiased and
   interpolated climate projections from 17 global climate models used in
   the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change. Among these models a warming trend is universal, but projected
   changes in precipitation vary in sign and magnitude. Two independent
   methods are applied: a dynamic global vegetation model to assess changes
   in plant functional types and bioclimatic envelope modeling to assess
   changes in individual tree and shrub species and biodiversity. The
   former approach investigates broad responses of plant functional types
   to climate change, while considering competition, disturbances, and
   carbon fertilization, while the latter approach focuses on the response
   of individual plant species, and net biodiversity, to climate change.
   The dynamic model simulates a region-wide reduction in vegetation cover
   during the 21st century, with a partial replacement of evergreen trees
   with grasses in the mountains of Colorado and Utah, except at the
   highest elevations, where tree cover increases. Across southern Arizona,
   central New Mexico, and eastern Colorado, grass cover declines, in some
   cases abruptly. Due to the prevalent warming trend among all 17 climate
   models, vegetation cover declines in the 21st century, with the greatest
   vegetation losses associated with models that project a drying trend.
   The inclusion of the carbon fertilization effect largely ameliorates the
   projected vegetation loss.
   Based on bioclimatic envelope modeling for the 21st century, the number
   of tree and shrub species that are expected to experience robust
   declines in range likely outweighs the number of species that are
   expected to expand in range. Dramatic shifts in plant species richness
   are projected, with declines in the high-elevation evergreen forests,
   increases in the eastern New Mexico prairies, and a northward shift of
   the Sonoran Desert biodiversity maximum.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to habitat distribution modeling is presented and tested
   with data on North American plants. The relative frequency function
   (RFF) algorithm compares the relative frequencies of a species sample
   points to that of random points or absence points on the landscape to
   compute a frequency ratio. The relative frequency ratio r is smoothed
   across the range of values using moving, overlapping windows. The ratio
   of frequencies at a sample point for each variable is used to compute
   the geometric mean score for all data with non-missing values. Variables
   are added using a forward stepwise method. Confidence intervals are
   computed with bootstrap resampling. The method was tested with
   artificial and species habitat and geographic range data. The RFF method
   in all cases gave results comparable to other methods tested. For the
   species with good geographic range maps, the results were consistent
   with known biogeography. The RFF method is particularly well-suited to
   irregularly shaped distributions and can classify sample points even

Abstract = {{1. Climate change is a major threat to biodiversity, ecosystem services,
   and human well-being. Mitigating its effects on living organisms and
   societies will be at the heart of most environmental management
   strategies, which will need to be informed by integrative scientific
   approaches. This Issues Special Profile provides examples of such
   approaches. 2. Responses of species to change in climatic conditions
   will range from thriving (i.e. species capable of living under the new
   set of conditions) to adapting (i.e. species capable of surviving a
   change in global conditions by changing their ecology and/or
   distribution) and going extinct. Yet there is a need to identify which
   species will fall into which categories, as well as a need to understand
   how to facilitate species ability to adapt to change. 3. Landscape
   management will be key to ensuring that functional, resilient ecosystems
   are maintained. Preserving the complexity and function of ecosystems can
   help mitigate the impact of extreme climatic conditions on the delivery
   of vital services such as climate regulation, primary production and
   water retention. 4. To mitigate further biodiversity loss, healthy
   habitats will also need to be better connected. In many situations,
   developing ecological networks will require costly habitat restoration
   at large spatial scales: to maximise opportunities for these networks to
   be created and be successful, landscape-scale assessments of the
   provision and value of multiple ecosystem services under alternative
   management regimes will need to inform decisions as to where and how to
   implement their creation. 5. Synthesis and applications. Climate change
   is only starting to shape the ecological research agenda, as the
   complexity of the impact of this phenomenon on biodiversity and
   ecosystem services slowly unveils. Because changes in climatic
   conditions are expected to hit everyone everywhere, effective solutions
   for climate change mitigation will require science to truly engage with
   society and support decision-making processes at local, national and

Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{670-679}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Environmental variables are often used as indirect surrogates for
   mapping biodiversity because species survey data are scant at regional
   scales, especially in the marine realm. However, environmental variables
   are measured on arbitrary scales unlikely to have simple, direct
   relationships with biological patterns. Instead, biodiversity may
   respond nonlinearly and to interactions between environmental variables.
   2. To investigate the role of the environment in driving patterns of
   biodiversity composition in large marine regions, we collated multiple
   biological survey and environmental data sets from tropical NE
   Australia, the deep Gulf of Mexico and the temperate Gulf of Maine. We
   then quantified the shape and magnitude of multispecies responses along
   >30 environmental gradients and the extent to which these variables
   predicted regional distributions. To do this, we applied a new
   statistical approach, Gradient Forest, an extension of Random Forest,
   capable of modelling nonlinear and threshold responses. 3. The
   regional-scale environmental variables predicted an average of 1335\%
   (up to 5085\% for individual species) of the variation in species
   abundance distributions. Important predictors differed among regions and
   biota and included depth, salinity, temperature, sediment composition
   and current stress. The shapes of responses along gradients also
   differed and were nonlinear, often with thresholds indicative of step
   changes in composition. These differing regional responses were partly
   due to differing environmental indicators of bioregional boundaries and,
   given the results to date, may indicate limited scope for extrapolating
   bio-physical relationships beyond the region of source data sets. 4.
   Synthesis and applications. Gradient Forest offers a new capability for
   exploring relationships between biodiversity and environmental
   gradients, generating new information on multispecies responses at a
   detail not available previously. Importantly, given the scarcity of
   data, Gradient Forest enables the combined use of information from
   disparate data sets. The gradient response curves provide biologically
   informed transformations of environmental layers to predict and map
   expected patterns of biodiversity composition that represent sampled
   composition better than uninformed variables. The approach can be
   applied to support marine spatial planning and management and has
   similar applicability in terrestrial realms.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring the population trends of multiple animal species at a
   landscape scale is prohibitively expensive. However, advances in survey
   design, statistical methods, and the ability to estimate species
   presence on the basis of detectionnondetection data have greatly
   increased the feasibility of species-level monitoring. For example,
   recent advances in monitoring make use of detectionnondetection data
   that are relatively inexpensive to acquire, historical survey data, and
   new techniques in genetic evaluation. The ability to use indirect
   measures of presence for some species greatly increases monitoring
   efficiency and reduces survey costs. After adjusting for false absences,
   the proportion of sample units in a landscape where a species is
   detected (occupancy) is a logical state variable to monitor. Occupancy
   monitoring can be based on real-time observation of a species at a
   survey site or on evidence that the species was at the survey location
   sometime in the recent past. Temporal and spatial patterns in occupancy
   data are related to changes in animal abundance and provide insights
   into the probability of a species' persistence. However, even with the
   efficiencies gained when occupancy is the monitored state variable, the
   task of species-level monitoring remains daunting due to the large
   number of species. We propose that a small number of species be

Abstract = {{Continental evaporation is a significant and dynamic flux within the
   atmospheric water budget, but few methods provide robust observational
   constraints on the large-scale hydroclimatological and hydroecological
   impacts of this `recycled-water' flux. We demonstrate a geospatial
   analysis that provides such information, using stable isotope data to
   map the distribution of recycled water in shallow aquifers downwind from
   Lake Michigan. The delta H-2 and delta O-18 values of groundwater in the
   study region decrease from south to north, as expected based on
   meridional gradients in climate and precipitation isotope ratios. In
   contrast, deuterium excess ( d = delta H-2 - 8 x delta O-18) values
   exhibit a significant zonal gradient and finer-scale spatially patterned
   variation. Local d maxima occur in the northwest and southwest corners
   of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, where `lake-effect' precipitation
   events are abundant. We apply a published model that describes the
   effect of recycling from lakes on atmospheric vapor d values to estimate
   that up to 32\% of recharge into individual aquifers may be derived from
   recycled Lake Michigan water. Applying the model to geostatistical
   surfaces representing mean d values, we estimate that between 10\% and
   18\% of the vapor evaporated from Lake Michigan is re-precipitated
   within downwind areas of the Lake Michigan drainage basin. Our approach
   provides previously unavailable observational constraints on regional
   land-atmosphere water fluxes in the Great Lakes Basin and elucidates
   patterns in recycled-water fluxes that may influence the biogeography of
   the region. As new instruments and networks facilitate enhanced spatial
   monitoring of environmental water isotopes, similar analyses can be
   widely applied to calibrate and validate water cycle models and improve

Abstract = {{Altered fire regimes are a driver of biodiversity decline. To plan
   effective management, we need to know how species are influenced by fire
   and to develop theory describing fire responses. Animal responses to
   fire are usually measured using methods that rely on animal activity,
   but animal activity may vary with time since fire, potentially biasing
   results. Using a novel approach for detecting bias in the pit-fall trap
   method, we found that leaf-litter dependent reptiles were more active up
   to 6 weeks after fire, giving a misleading impression of abundance. This
   effect was not discovered when modelling detectability with
   zero-inflated binomial models. Two species without detection bias showed
   early-successional responses to time since fire, consistent with a
   habitat-accommodation succession model. However, a habitat specialist
   did not have the predicted low abundance after fire due to increased
   post-fire movement and non-linear recovery of a key habitat component.
   Interactions between fire and other processes therefore must be better
   understood to predict reptile responses to changing fire-regimes. We
   conclude that there is substantial bias when trapping reptiles after
   fire, with species that are otherwise hard to detect appearing to be
   abundant. Studies that use a survey method based on animal activity such
   as bird calls or animal movements, likely face a similar risk of bias

   species on plots as small as 1000 m2. The species composition of tree
   communities changed rapidly (high beta-diversity) across soil boundaries
   and rainfall regimes. Twenty-one endemic and eight threatened tree
   species were recorded in our inventories. Individuals of G.similar to
   sanctum represented up to 55\% of the above-ground carbon for trees =5
   cm dbh. The high basal area of G.similar to sanctum forests plus the
   high wood density, abundance, large size and longevity (more than 500
   years) of G.similar to sanctum and other tree species enhance the
   potential importance of these forests for carbon storage. Main
   conclusions A conservation strategy focused on protecting important
   populations of G.similar to sanctum in the Yucatan Peninsula would have
   significant co-benefits for conservation of regional tree species
   biodiversity and provision of critical ecosystem services. Our study
   illustrates a multiple criteria approach useful for the selection of
   areas with high conservation value on the basis of endemic, threatened
   species, species richness and ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Thresholds often exist in the relationship between species richness
   and the area of remaining habitat in human-modified landscapes,
   prompting debate about the mechanisms responsible. We hypothesize that
   if speciesarea relationships differ with underlying factors such as
   landscape productivity, and such factors correlate with patterns of
   habitat clearance, then spurious thresholds can arise where the separate
   speciesarea relationships intersect. We assessed whether this phenomenon
   could explain landscape-level speciesarea relationships for birds
   occupying 31 landscapes of 100 km2 in eastern Australia. Location
   Eastern Australia. Methods Landscape-level species richness estimates
   were modelled as a function of the percentage of native vegetation
   remaining in the study landscapes. The performance of traditional
   speciesarea curves and continuous and discontinuous piecewise models was
   compared using an information theoretic approach. Separate models for
   high- and low-productivity and high- and low-fragmentation landscapes
   were examined to determine whether they implied different speciesarea
   relationships. Results The speciesarea relationship exhibited a rapid
   change-point at approximately 40\% vegetation cover, but this was most
   parsimoniously explained by two disjunct slopes rather than a continuous
   threshold model or a classic speciesarea curve. Exploration of models
   fitted separately to high- and low-productivity landscapes suggested
   that such landscapes may differ in their characteristic speciesarea
   relationships. Main conclusions The observed pattern is consistent with
   the spurious threshold hypothesis, and opens a new avenue of enquiry
   into the processes behind apparent ecological thresholds. This
   hypothesis may be valid in other regions where clearing history is
   confounded by underlying factors such as landscape productivity, and
   demands further research. In such systems, real thresholds for different
   landscape types may occur at different levels of cover, or might not
   exist at all. If so, a simple space-for-time substitution may not be
   valid, and management prescriptions based on threshold values (e.g.
   40\%) will be flawed.}},

Abstract = {{Payment for ecosystem services (PES) has been widely promoted as an

Abstract = {{1. To manage the environmental flow requirements of sedentary taxa, such
   as mussels and aquatic insects with fixed retreats, we need a measure of
   habitat availability over a variety of flows (i.e. a measure of
   persistent habitat). Habitat suitability measures in current
   environmental flow assessments are measured on a flow by flow basis and
   thus are not appropriate for these taxa. Here, we present a novel
   measure of persistent habitat suitability for the dwarf wedgemussel
   (Alasmidonta heterodon), listed as federally endangered in the U.S.A.,
   in three reaches of the Delaware River. 2. We used a two-dimensional
   hydrodynamic model to quantify suitable habitat over a range of flows
   based on modelled depth, velocity, Froude number, shear velocity and
   shear stress at three scales (individual mussel, mussel bed and reach).
   Baseline potentially persistent habitat was quantified as the sum of
   pixels that met all thresholds identified for these variables for flows
   =40 m3 s-1, and we calculated the loss of persistently suitable habitat
   by sequentially summing suitable habitat estimates at lower flows. We
   estimated the proportion of mussel beds exposed at each flow and the
   amount of change in the size of the mussel bed for one reach. 3. For two
   reaches, mussel beds occupied areas with lower velocity, shear velocity,
   shear stress and Froude number than the reach average at all flows. In
   the third reach, this was true only at higher flows. Together, these
   results indicate that beds were possible refuge areas from the effects
   of these hydrological parameters. Two reaches showed an increase in the
   amount of exposed mussel beds with decreasing flow. 4. Baseline
   potentially persistent habitat was less than half the areal extent of
   potentially suitable habitat, and it decreased with decreasing flow.
   Actually identified beds and modelled persistent habitat showed good
   spatial overlap, but identified beds occupied only a portion of the
   total modelled persistent habitat, indicating either that additional
   suitable habitat is available or the need to improve habitat criteria.
   At one site, persistent beds (beds where mussels were routinely
   collected) were located at sites with stable substratum, whereas
   marginal beds (beds where mussels were infrequently collected or that
   were lost following a large flood event) were located in scoured areas.
   5. Taken together, these model results support a multifaceted approach,
   which incorporates the effects of low and high flow stressors, to
   quantify habitat suitability for mussels and other sedentary taxa.
   Models of persistent habitat can provide a more holistic environmental
   flow assessment of rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Although digital photography is an efficient and objective
   means of extracting green fractional vegetation cover (FVC), it lacks
   automation and classification accuracy. How can green FVC be extracted
   from digital images in an accurate and automatedmethod? Methods: Several
   colour spaces were compared on the basis of a separability index, and
   CIE L {*} a {*} b {*} was shown to be optimal for the tested colour
   spaces. Thus, all image processing was performed in CIE L {*} a {*} b
   {*} colour space. Gaussian models were used to fit the green vegetation
   and background distributions of the a {*} component. Three strategies
   (T0, T1 and T2 thresholding method) were tested to select the optimal
   thresholds for segmenting the image into green vegetation and non-green
   vegetation. The a {*} components of the images were then segmented and
   the green FVC extracted. Results: The FVC extracted using T0, T1, and T2
   thresholding methods were evaluated with simulated images, and
   cross-validated with FVC extracted with supervised classification
   methods. The results show that FVC extracted with T0, T1 and T2
   thresholding methods are similar to those estimated with supervised
   classificationmethods. Themean errors associated with the FVC values
   provided in our approach and supervised classification are less than
   0.035. In a test with simulated data, our method performed better than
   the supervised classification method. Conclusions: Methods presented in
   this paper were demonstrated to be feasible and applicable for
   automatically and accurately extracting FVC of several green vegetation
   types with varying background and shadow conditions. However, our
   algorithm design assumes a Gaussian distribution for both vegetated and

Abstract = {{Gap models are flexible tools for the simulation of forest dynamics
   under different climatic conditions. An important area, however, has not
   yet received the attention it deserves: the formulation of height growth
   and maximum tree height. In most gap models, every tree approaches a
   fixed maximum height regardless of site conditions, and tree height as
   such is approximated via stem diameter. To address these issues, we
   converted maximum height from a parameter to a variable that depends on
   site-specific climatic conditions. We also established tree height as a
   separate state variable besides diameter, to allow for competition
   effects to influence the ratio between height and diameter growth. The
   new model formulations were tested against data from the Swiss National
   Forest Inventory (NFI) and from a forest growth and yield research plot.
   Lastly the new model version was applied to study productivity changes
   due to climate change along an environmental gradient.
   The new model formulations increased the accuracy of simulations of
   stand characteristics without negatively influencing the general
   applicability of the model. The height/diameter relationship of a
   Douglas-fir stand in Switzerland simulated with the new model version
   resembled measurements closely, and biomass simulated along an
   environmental gradient agreed better with measurements (NFI) when using
   the new model version. Simulations with site-specific maximum height
   showed that the maximum heights of the dominant species on the gradient
   did not differ significantly from NFI data, whereas static maximum
   heights did.
   The application of the old and new model versions to simulate
   productivity under climatic change along the same environmental gradient
   showed that the conversion of a static parameter such as maximum height
   to a site-specific variable is not only a desirable, but a crucial
   feature to incorporate, since climate-induced changes in productivity
   are simulated to be more pronounced with the new model formulation. We
   conclude that dynamic height growth and site-specific maximum tree
   height can significantly improve simulation results of forest succession
   models, especially with regard to forest management under climate

Abstract = {{Technological advances have created new opportunities for defining and
   mapping ecological and biogeographical regions on the basis of

   the sensitivity of ecoregionalizations to clustering methods and

   regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering
   and partitioning (REDCAP), to identify hierarchical regions based on
   measures of forest extent, connectivity, and change for 2109 watersheds
   in the continental U.S. Unlike regionalizations developed using
   non-spatial clustering techniques. REDCAP directly incorporates a
   spatial contiguity constraint into a traditional hierarchical clustering
   method, resulting in contiguous regions that optimize a homogeneity
   measure. Results of our analyses identified nine- and eighteen-class
   Forest Pattern Regions that reflected the influence of natural and
   anthropogenic factors structuring forest extent and fragmentation.
   Because these regions are defined by the forest pattern metrics
   themselves, rather than pre-defined political or ecological units, they
   provide a valuable means for visualizing forest pattern information and
   quantifying forest patterns across a large, diverse geographic area. In
   contrast, regionalizations of the same data using two non-spatial
   methods (k-means clustering and non-spatial average linkage clustering)
   resulted in more homogeneous classes composed of many discontiguous
   units. While it should not be viewed as a replacement for non-spatial
   clustering techniques, REDCAP provides an alternative approach to
   developing ecological regionalizations by placing greater emphasis on
   maintaining the spatial contiguity of units, a property that may be
   desirable in many broad-scale regionalizations because it reduces data

Abstract = {{Understanding and predicting the dynamics of organisms is a central
   objective in ecology and conservation biology, and modelling provides a
   solution to tackling this problem. However, the complex nature of
   ecological systems means that for a thorough understanding of ecological
   dynamics at hierarchical scales, a set of modeling approaches need to be
   adopted. This review illustrates how modelling approaches can be used to
   understand the dynamics of organisms in applied ecological problems,
   focussing on mechanistic models at a local scale and statistical models
   at a broad scale. Mechanistic models incorporate ecological processes
   explicitly and thus are likely to be robust under novel conditions.
   Models based on behavioural decisions by individuals represent a typical
   example of the successful application of mechanistic models to applied
   problems. Considering the data-hungry nature of such mechanistic models,
   model complexity and parameterisation need to be explored further for a
   quick and widespread implementation of this model type. For broad-scale
   phenomena, statistical models play an important role in dealing with
   problems that are often inherent in data. Examples include models for
   quantifying population trends from long-term, large-scale data and those
   for comparative methods of extinction risk. Novel statistical approaches
   also allow mechanistic models to be parameterised using readily obtained
   data at a macro scale. In conclusion, the complementary use and
   improvement of multiple model types, the increased use of novel model

   achievement of wider biodiversity information availability are key
   challenges for the effective use of modelling in applied ecological

Abstract = {{Inequality in reproductive success has important implications for
   ecological and evolutionary dynamics, but lifetime reproductive success
   is challenging to measure in long-lived species such as forest trees.
   While seed production is often used as a proxy for overall reproductive
   success, high mortality of seeds and the potential for trade-offs
   between seed number and quality draw this assumption into question.
   Parentage analyses of established seedlings can bring us one step closer
   to understanding the causes and consequences of variation in
   reproductive success. In this paper we demonstrate a new method for
   estimating individual seedling production and average percentage
   germination, using data from two mixed-species populations of red oaks
   (Quercus rubra, Q. velutina, Q. falcata, and Q. coccinea). We use these
   estimates to examine the distribution of female reproductive success and
   to test the relationship between seedling number and individual seed
   production, age, and growth rate. We show that both seed and seedling
   production are highly skewed, roughly conforming to zero-inflated
   lognormal distributions, rather than to the Poisson or negative-binomial
   distributions often assumed by population genetics analyses. While the
   number of established offspring is positively associated with mean
   annual seed production, a lower proportion of seeds from highly fecund
   individuals become seedlings. Our red oak populations also show evidence
   of trade-offs between growth rate and reproductive success. The high
   degree of inequality in seedling production shown here for red oaks, and
   by previous studies in other species, suggests that many trees may be
   more vulnerable to genetic drift than previously thought, if immigration

Abstract = {{Habitat loss poses a severe threat to biodiversity. While many studies
   yield valuable information on how specific species cope with such
   environmental modification, the mechanistic understanding of how
   interacting species or whole communities are affected by habitat loss is
   still poor. Individual movement plays a crucial role for the space use
   characteristics of species, since it determines how individuals perceive
   and use their heterogeneous environment. At the community level, it is
   therefore essential to include individual movement and how it is
   influenced by resource sharing into the investigation of consequences of
   habitat loss. To elucidate the effects of foraging movement on
   communities in face of habitat loss, we here apply a recently published
   spatially-explicit and individual-based model of home range formation.
   This approach allows predicting the individual size distribution (ISD)
   of mammal communities in simulation landscapes that vary in the amount
   of suitable habitat. We apply three fundamentally different foraging
   movement approaches (central place forager (CPF), patrolling forager
   (PF) and body mass dependent nomadic forager (BNF)). Results show that
   the efficiency of the different foraging strategies depends on body
   mass, which again affects community structure in face of habitat loss.
   CPF is only efficient for small animals, and therefore yields steep ISD
   exponents on which habitat loss has little effect (due to a movement
   limitation of body mass). PF and particularly BNF are more efficient for
   larger animals, resulting in less steep ISDs with higher mass maxima,
   both showing a threshold behaviour with regard to loss of suitable
   habitat. These findings represent a new way of explaining observed
   extinction thresholds, and therefore indicate the importance of
   individual space use characterized by physiology and behaviour, i.e.
   foraging movement, for communities and their response to habitat loss.
   Findings also indicate the necessity to incorporate the crucial role of
   movement into future conservation efforts of terrestrial communities.}},

Abstract = {{Gene duplication can increase an organism's ability to mask the effect
   of deleterious alleles present in the population, but this is typically
   a small effect when the source of the genetic variation is mutation.
   Migration can introduce orders of magnitude more deleterious alleles per
   generation and may therefore be an important force acting on the
   structure of genomes. Using formal analytical methods, we study the
   invasion of haplotypes containing two copies of the resident allele,
   assuming that a single-locus equilibrium is already established in a
   continent-island model of migration. Provided that the immigrant allele
   can be completely masked by multiple functional gene copies, a new
   duplication will deterministically spread so long as duplicate
   haplotypes are, on average, fitter than single-copy haplotypes. When
   fitness depends on the number of immigrant allele copies and their
   masking ability then the threshold for invasion depends on the rate of
   immigration and the rate of recombination between the gene copies.
   Results from several special cases, including formation of protein
   dimers and DobzhanskyMuller incompatibilities, suggest that duplications
   can invade in a wide range of selection regimes. We hypothesize that
   duplication in response to gene flow may provide an explanation for the

Abstract = {{A low-intervention approach to restoration that also allows restoration
   outcomes to be framed as trajectories of ecosystem change can be
   described as open-ended restoration. It is an approach which recognizes
   that long-term ecosystem behavior involves continual change at small and
   large spatial and temporal scales. There are a number of situations in
   which it is appropriate to adopt an open-ended approach to restoration
   including: in remote and large areas, where ecological limiting factors
   will be changed by future climates, where antecedent conditions cannot
   be replicated, where there are novel starting points for restoration,
   where restoration relies strongly on processes outside the restoration
   area, in inherently dynamic systems, where costs are high and where the
   public demands wildness. Where this approach is adopted managers need to
   explain the project and deal with public expectations and public risk.
   Monitoring biotic and abiotic components of the project are very
   important as an open-ended approach does not equate to abandon and
   ignore it.}},

Abstract = {{This review paper reports the consensus of a technical workshop hosted
   by the European network, NanoImpactNet (NIN). The workshop aimed to
   review the collective experience of working at the bench with
   manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs), and to recommend modifications to
   existing experimental methods and OECD protocols. Current procedures for
   cleaning glassware are appropriate for most MNMs, although interference
   with electrodes may occur. Maintaining exposure is more difficult with
   MNMs compared to conventional chemicals. A metal salt control is
   recommended for experiments with metallic MNMs that may release free
   metal ions. Dispersing agents should be avoided, but if they must be
   used, then natural or synthetic dispersing agents are possible, and
   dispersion controls essential. Time constraints and technology gaps
   indicate that full characterisation of test media during ecotoxicity
   tests is currently not practical. Details of electron microscopy,
   dark-field microscopy, a range of spectroscopic methods (EDX, XRD,
   XANES, EXAFS), light scattering techniques (DLS, SLS) and chromatography
   are discussed. The development of user-friendly software to predict
   particle behaviour in test media according to DLVO theory is in
   progress, and simple optical methods are available to estimate the
   settling behaviour of suspensions during experiments. However, for soil
   matrices such simple approaches may not be applicable. Alternatively, a
   Critical Body Residue approach may be taken in which body concentrations
   in organisms are related to effects, and toxicity thresholds derived.
   For microbial assays, the cell wall is a formidable barrier to MNMs and
   end points that rely on the test substance penetrating the cell may be
   insensitive. Instead assays based on the cell envelope should be
   developed for MNMs. In algal growth tests, the abiotic factors that
   promote particle aggregation in the media (e.g. ionic strength) are also
   important in providing nutrients, and manipulation of the media to
   control the dispersion may also inhibit growth. Controls to quantify
   shading effects, and precise details of lighting regimes, shaking or
   mixing should be reported in algal tests. Photosynthesis may be more
   sensitive than traditional growth end points for algae and plants. Tests
   with invertebrates should consider non-chemical toxicity from particle
   adherence to the organisms. The use of semi-static exposure methods with
   fish can reduce the logistical issues of waste water disposal and
   facilitate aspects of animal husbandry relevant to MMNs. There are
   concerns that the existing bioaccumulation tests are conceptually flawed
   for MNMs and that new test(s) are required. In vitro testing strategies,
   as exemplified by genotoxicity assays, can be modified for MNMs, but the
   risk of false negatives in some assays is highlighted. In conclusion,
   most protocols will require some modifications and recommendations are
   made to aid the researcher at the bench.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The main purpose of this work is to understand the origin, history,
   historical biogeography and mechanisms of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera
   L.) domestication.
   Location Seeds of uncultivated Phoenix individuals from isolated Oman
   populations, cultivated date palm varieties of various geographical
   origins and other related Phoenix species were analysed. Additionally,
   well-preserved seeds from Egyptian archaeological sites (14th century bc
   to 8th century ad) were compared with the morphometric reference model
   based on the analysis of modern material.
   Methods Elliptic Fourier transforms (EFT), a morphometric method applied
   to shape outline analysis, were used to characterize seed shape and to
   quantify morphological diversity in P. dactylifera and related species.
   Results Analysis of seed outlines by EFT (1) showed that P. dactylifera
   can be differentiated from other Phoenix species and (2) enabled the
   quantification of patterns of shape differentiation in the genus Phoenix
   at different taxonomic, geographical and chronological levels. Date palm
   agrobiodiversity, partitioned in distinct morphotypes, appeared to be
   complex in terms of geographical structure. Allocation of archaeological
   seeds to different modern Phoenix forms and date palm morphotypes
   allowed us to reveal ancient forms consumed and/or exploited in Egypt
   and finally to determine spatial and temporal changes in
   agrobiodiversity.
   Main conclusions Based on the morphological diversity quantified in P.
   dactylifera and related species, we characterized ancestral seed shape
   features present in uncultivated populations. The geographical
   distribution pattern of seed shapes points to human dispersal routes
   that spread cultivation from one or more initial `domestication
   centres'. Finally, this work provides a powerful tool to identify
   ancient forms as demonstrated by the analysis of well-preserved Egyptian
   archaeological seeds, dating from the 14th century bc to the 8th century
   ad. Results open new and fascinating perspectives on the investigation
   of the origins and chrono-geographical fluctuation of date palm
   agrobiodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To test the ability of biological traits to predict climate-related
   changes in geographical ranges of running-water invertebrates.
   Location The Australian state of New South Wales and the Australian
   Capital Territory.
   Methods I analysed data from 8928 biomonitoring samples collected during
   a 16-year period of generally rising air temperatures and declining
   precipitation. I used quantile regression to test for expansions and
   contractions on the climatically cooler, warmer, drier and wetter edges
   of the ranges of 120 invertebrate taxa, and correlated these shifts with
   the traits of thermophily (degree of preference for high versus low
   temperature) and rheophily (preference for flowing versus still water).
   Results The most commonly inferred range shifts were cool-edge expansion
   plus warm-edge contraction (71 taxa) and wet-edge expansion plus
   dry-edge contraction (71), but contractions from both cool and warm
   extremes (36) and from both dry and wet extremes (28) were also
   frequent. High-temperature preference was associated with cool-edge
   expansion and low-temperature preference with wet-edge expansion and
   contraction from all other extremes. A preference for flow was
   associated with wet-edge expansion and dry-edge contraction.
   Main conclusions Trait analysis has potential for predicting which
   species will expand their ranges and which will contract, but needs to
   be coupled with assessment of how the landscape provides each species
   with opportunities to track or avoid climate change. Improved
   quantification of climatically relevant traits and integration of trait
   analysis with species distribution modelling are likely to be

Abstract = {{Aim: Ecosystems face numerous well-documented threats from climate
   change. The well-being of people also is threatened by climate change,
   most prominently by reduced food security. Human adaptation to food
   scarcity, including shifting agricultural zones, will create new threats
   for natural ecosystems. We investigated how shifts in crop suitability
   because of climate change may overlap currently protected areas (PAs)
   and priority sites for PA expansion in South Africa. Predicting the
   locations of suitable climate conditions for crop growth will assist
   conservationists and decision-makers in planning for climate change.
   Location: South Africa.
   Methods: We modelled climatic suitability in 2055 for maize and wheat
   cultivation, two extensively planted, staple crops, and overlaid
   projected changes with PAs and PA expansion priorities.
   Results: Changes in winter climate could make an additional 2 million ha
   of land suitable for wheat cultivation, while changes in summer climate
   could expand maize suitability by up to 3.5 million ha. Conversely, 3
   million ha of lands currently suitable for wheat production are
   predicted to become climatically unsuitable, along with 13 million ha
   for maize. At least 328 of 834 (39\%) PAs are projected to be affected
   by altered wheat or maize suitability in their buffer zones.
   Main conclusions: Reduced crop suitability and food scarcity in
   subsistence areas may lead to the exploitation of PAs for food and fuel.
   However, if reduced crop suitability leads to agricultural abandonment,
   this may afford opportunities for ecological restoration. Expanded crop
   suitability in PA buffer zones could lead to additional isolation of PAs
   if portions of newly suitable land are converted to agriculture. These
   results suggest that altered crop suitability will be widespread
   throughout South Africa, including within and around lands identified as
   conservation priorities. Assessing how climate change will affect crop
   suitability near PAs is a first step towards proactively identifying
   potential conflicts between human adaptation and conservation planning.}},

Title = {{Phreatic groundwater ecosystems: research frontiers for freshwater
   ecology}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{885-906}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Phreatic ecosystems (saturated groundwater ecosystems in porous and
   fractured-rock aquifers) are research frontiers for freshwater ecology.
   Many ecological issues that have been explored at length in
   surface-water and hyporheic systems are unexplored in phreatic systems.
   Phreatic ecology is currently dominated by observational studies rather
   than experiments and focuses on pattern-detection and description,
   rather than hypothesis-testing and mechanistic explanations. These are
   characteristics of science disciplines in early developmental stages.
   2. Progress in phreatic ecology has been impeded by logistical problems
   including poor access, limited information about ecosystem boundaries
   and spatial heterogeneity, a lack of detailed habitat templates, limited
   taxonomic and biogeographic knowledge and the difficulties of field
   experiments. Each of these problems is assessed in this review, along
   with analytical techniques, instruments and concepts that may help
   researchers overcome them.
   3. Access to undisturbed phreatic systems is generally limited to narrow
   zones around wells. Limited access and sparse well arrays make detecting
   ecological patterns and relationships and delineating ecosystem
   boundaries difficult. Spatial resolution can be increased by installing
   wells in configurations suited to specific research topics;
   geostatistical methods are available for positioning new wells and
   optimising interpolation between them.
   4. Phreatic systems are characterised by multi-scaled spatial and
   temporal heterogeneity. Lithofacies aggregations, buried fluvial
   bedforms, rock fractures and other geomorphic elements create structural
   and hydraulic heterogeneity, which lead in turn to spatial variation in
   solutes, biota and biogeochemical processes. The structural and
   hydraulic heterogeneity of study areas can be characterised and mapped
   with geophysical surveys and groundwater flow models. These models can
   help to identify flowpaths, recharge zones and aquifer boundaries and
   provide ecologically relevant hydrological variables.
   5. Physical habitat templates and classifications are needed to explain
   variation in phreatic populations and communities. A candidate
   classification system is proposed, based on environmental factors that
   govern the distribution and quality of groundwater habitats: climate,
   lithology, aquifer, confinement, recharge, hydrofacies and flowpath.
   6. Many phreatic species and higher-level taxa remain undescribed, and
   the taxonomic resolution used in phreatic ecology studies is generally
   coarse. These problems impede progress in community ecology,
   biogeography and conservation biology. DNA barcoding and other molecular
   taxonomy methods are now being applied to groundwater fauna. Combining
   molecular taxonomy and traditional morphological methods could increase
   the accuracy and efficiency of species identification and help to define
   taxonomic boundaries.
   7. Field experiments and mensurative studies are rarely used in phreatic
   ecology, but they are needed to detect spatial and temporal patterns,
   quantify ecological relationships and test hypotheses and classification
   systems. Techniques from groundwater remediation and recharge studies
   can be adapted to ecological field experiments that utilise natural
   aquifer structures and groundwater flow dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread human modification and conversion of land has led to loss and
   fragmentation of natural ecosystems, altering ecological processes and

   developed a novel, robust modeling approach to estimate the connectivity
   of natural landscapes as a gradient of permeability. Our approach yields
   a map capable of prioritizing places that are important for maintaining
   and potentially restoring ecological flows across the United States and
   informing conservation initiatives at regional, national, or continental
   scales. We found that connectivity routes with very high centrality
   intersected proposed energy corridors in the western United States at
   roughly 500 locations and intersected 733 moderate to heavily used
   highways (10(4)-10(6) vehicles per day). Roughly 15\% of the most highly
   connected locations are currently secured by protected lands, whereas
   28\% of these occur on public lands that permit resource extraction, and
   the remaining 57\% are unprotected. The landscape permeability map can
   inform land use planning and policy about places potentially important

Abstract = {{The Red List Index (RLI), which uses information from the IUCN Red List
   to track trends in the projected overall extinction risk of sets of
   species, is among the indicators adopted by the world's governments to
   assess performance under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the
   United Nations Millennium Development Goals. For greatest impact, such
   indicators need to be measured and used at a national scale as well as
   globally. We present the first application of the RLI based on
   assessments of extinction risk at the national scale using IUCN's
   recommended methods, evaluating trends in the status of Australian birds
   for 1990-2010. We calculated RLIs based on the number of taxa in each
   Red List category and the number that changed categories between
   assessments in 1990, 2000 and 2010 as a result of genuine improvement or
   deterioration in status. A novel comparison between trends at the
   species and ultrataxon (subspecies or monotypic species) level showed
   that these were remarkably similar, suggesting that current global RLI
   trends at the species level may also be a useful surrogate for tracking
   losses in genetic diversity at this scale, for which no global measures
   currently exist. The RLI for Australia is declining faster than global
   rates when migratory shorebirds and seabirds are included, but not when
   changes resulting from threats in Australia alone are considered. The
   RLI of oceanic island taxa has declined faster than those on the
   continent or on continental islands. There were also differences in the
   performance of different jurisdictions within Australia. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Conditional strategies are the most common form of discrete phenotypic
   plasticity. In a conditional strategy, the phenotype expressed by an
   organism is determined by the difference between an environmental cue
   and a threshold, both of which may vary among individuals. The
   environmental threshold model (ETM) has been proposed as a mean to
   understand the evolution of conditional strategies, but has been
   surprisingly seldom applied to empirical studies. A hindrance for the
   application of the ETM is that often, the proximate cue triggering the
   phenotypic expression and the individual threshold are not measurable,
   and can only be assessed using a related observable cue. We describe a
   new statistical model that can be applied in this common situation. The
   Latent ETM (LETM) allows for a measurement error in the phenotypic
   expression of the individual environmental cue and a purely genetically
   determined threshold. We show that coupling our model with quantitative
   genetic methods allows an evolutionary approach including an estimation
   of the heritability of conditional strategies. We evaluate the
   performance of the LETM with a simulation study and illustrate its
   utility by applying it to empirical data on the size-dependent smolting

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{234-244}},

Abstract = {{1. Ecological data analysis frequently calls for the assessment of the
   relationship between species composition and a set of explanatory
   variables of interest. The assessment may have to be pursued while
   taking into account the influence of another set of explanatory
   variables. The hypothetical nature and structure of the influence of an
   explanatory set on the effect of a distinct explanatory set guides the
   proper choice of modelling methodology for a combined explanatory
   assessment. 2. Here, we describe a framework where the relationship
   between the response data and a main set of explanatory variables is not
   linear. It may, for example, take the form of abrupt changes in the
   response following thresholds of the explanatory variables, or any other
   nonlinearizable relationship. The influence of a second set of
   explanatory variables is determined a posteriori, after the influence of
   the main explanatory set has been taken into account. This is useful
   when one of the sets is thought to have an effect that varies as a
   function of the other. 3. To achieve this type of assessment, we propose
   a cascade of multivariate regression trees ( CMRT). We decompose the
   total dispersion of a response matrix between two explanatory data sets
   in a nested manner. By handling each leaf ( group) resulting from the
   first-level multivariate regression tree ( MRT) analysis as separate
   independent data sets in following analyses, we can separate the
   explanatory power of the first partition from those of the subordinate
   partitions computed using a second explanatory set. A preliminary
   biological hypothesis will guide the choice of which set of explanatory
   variables should be used to compute the main partition. The method could
   be extended to more than two explanatory data sets whose effects on the
   response data are hierarchical. 4. Cascade of multivariate regression
   trees allows the users to impose a nested structure to their causal
   hypotheses in MRT analysis. To illustrate this new procedure, we use the
   well-known and readily available Doubs fish and oribatid mite data sets
   and provide the necessary R functions in a package available onCRAN(

Abstract = {{1. The spatial analysis by distance indices (SADIE) methodology for data
   analysis is valuable for quantifying spatial patterns of organisms in
   terms of patches and gaps. Previous research showed that the calculation
   of the local clustering indices, key SADIE statistics, does not
   adequately adjust for the absolute location or the magnitude of the
   counts. 2. We present a new definition of a local clustering index,
   which overcomes the problem associated with the original cluster indices
   related to sampling position and count size. The new index is calculated
   without breaking the link between the observed count and its original
   position and quantifies the contribution of an observed count at this
   particular position to the local gaps or patches for the observed
   pattern relative to the expected under the assumption of spatial
   independence amongst observed counts. Randomisation-based testing for
   statistical significance of an individual local clustering index follows
   naturally from the definition of the new index. 3. New indices,
   calculated for several simulated and observed data sets, showed that the
   original indices overestimated the number of points (sites, locations)

Abstract = {{1. Structural diversity and niche differences within habitats are
   important for stabilizing species coexistence. However, land-use change
   leading to environmental homogenization is a major cause for the
   dramatic decline of biodiversity under global change. The difficulty in
   assessing large-scale biodiversity losses urgently requires new
   technological advances to evaluate land-use impact on diversity timely
   and efficiently across space. 2. While cost-effective aerial images have
   been suggested for potential biodiversity assessments in forests,
   correlation of canopy object variables such as gaps with plant or animal
   diversity has so far not been demonstrated using these images. 3. Here,
   we show that aerial images of canopy gaps can be used to assess
   floristic biodiversity of the forest understorey. This approach is made
   possible because we employed cutting-edge unmanned aerial vehicles and
   very high-resolution images (7 cm pixel) 1) of the canopy properties. We
   demonstrate that detailed, spatially implicit information on gap shape
   metrics is sufficient to reveal strong dependency between disturbance
   patterns and plant diversity (R 2 up to 0 74). This is feasible because
   opposing disturbance patterns such as aggregated and dispersed tree
   retention directly correspond to different functional and dispersal
   traits of species and ultimately to different species diversities. 4.
   Our findings can be used as a coarse-filter approach to conservation in
   forests wherever light strongly limits regeneration and biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Forecasting of species and ecosystem responses to novel conditions,
   including climate change, is one of the major challenges facing
   ecologists at the start of the 21st century. Climate change studies
   based on species distribution models (SDMs) have been criticized because
   they extend correlational relationships beyond the observed data. Here,
   we compared conventional climate-based SDMs against ecohydrological SDMs
   that include information from process-based simulations of water
   balance. We examined the current and future distribution of Artemisia
   tridentata (big sagebrush) representing sagebrush ecosystems, which are
   widespread in semiarid western North America. For each approach, we
   calculated ensemble models from nine SDM methods and tested accuracy of
   each SDM with a null distribution. Climatic conditions included current
   conditions for 19701999 and two IPCC projections B1 and A2 for 20702099.
   Ecohydrological conditions were assessed by simulating soil water
   balance with SOILWAT, a daily time-step, multiple layer, mechanistic,
   soil water model. Under current conditions, both climatic and
   ecohydrological SDM approaches produced comparable sagebrush
   distributions. Overall, sagebrush distribution is forecasted to
   decrease, with larger decreases under the A2 than under the B1 scenario
   and strong decreases in the southern part of the range. Increases were
   forecasted in the northern parts and at higher elevations. Both SDM
   approaches produced accurate predictions. However, the ecohydrological
   SDM approach was slightly less accurate than climatic SDMs (-1\% in AUC,
   -4\% in Kappa and TSS) and predicted a higher number of habitat patches
   than observed in the input data. Future predictions of ecohydrological
   SDMs included an increased number of habitat patches whereas climatic
   SDMs predicted a decrease. This difference is important for
   understanding landscape-scale patterns of sagebrush ecosystems and
   management of sagebrush obligate species for future conditions. Several
   mechanisms can explain the diverging forecasts; however, we need better
   insights into the consequences of different datasets for SDMs and how
   these affect our understanding of future trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an approach for estimating net ecosystem exchange (NEE) using
   inventory-based information over North America (NA) for a recent 7-year
   period (ca. 2000-2006). The approach notably retains information on the
   spatial distribution of NEE, or the vertical exchange between land and
   atmosphere of all non-fossil fuel sources and sinks of CO2, while
   accounting for lateral transfers of forest and crop products as well as
   their eventual emissions. The total NEE estimate of a -327 similar to
   +/-similar to 252 similar to TgC similar to yr-1 sink for NA was driven
   primarily by CO2 uptake in the Forest Lands sector (-248 similar to TgC
   similar to yr-1), largely in the Northwest and Southeast regions of the
   US, and in the Crop Lands sector (-297 similar to TgC similar to yr-1),
   predominantly in the Midwest US states. These sinks are counteracted by
   the carbon source estimated for the Other Lands sector (+218 similar to
   TgC similar to yr-1), where much of the forest and crop products are
   assumed to be returned to the atmosphere (through livestock and human
   consumption). The ecosystems of Mexico are estimated to be a small net
   source (+18 similar to TgC similar to yr-1) due to land use change
   between 1993 and 2002. We compare these inventory-based estimates with
   results from a suite of terrestrial biosphere and atmospheric inversion
   models, where the mean continental-scale NEE estimate for each ensemble
   is -511 similar to TgC similar to yr-1 and -931 similar to TgC similar
   to yr-1, respectively. In the modeling approaches, all sectors,
   including Other Lands, were generally estimated to be a carbon sink,
   driven in part by assumed CO2 fertilization and/or lack of consideration
   of carbon sources from disturbances and product emissions. Additional
   fluxes not measured by the inventories, although highly uncertain, could
   add an additional -239 similar to TgC similar to yr-1 to the
   inventory-based NA sink estimate, thus suggesting some convergence with
   the modeling approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal is an important step in animal's life cycle, one consequence
   of which is reducing local mate and resource competition. Dispersal is
   often achieved during one unique special movement, from the birthplace
   to a new appropriate area where to settle and reproduce. However, in
   species in which this special movement is limited by life history
   tradeoffs, we may expect dispersal to be promoted also by routine
   movements occurring throughout the animals life and stimulated by other
   activities like foraging or the search of nesting conditions. Here we
   employ a multidisciplinary approach consisting of computer simulations,
   markrecapture and genetic data to better understand the role of colony
   relocations as dispersal strategy in the gypsy ant Aphaenogaster
   senilis. Contrary to expectations, our results show that colony
   relocations do not result in effective dispersal as evidenced by
   markrecapture and genetic data. Furthermore, simulations showed that
   successive colony relocations did not follow a constant direction, but
   occurred either in a randomly changing direction or followed a circular
   trajectory, indicating limited effective dispersal. We also found a
   general lack of inbreeding and significant population viscosity between
   neighbouring colonies suggesting that relocations may act as a balancing
   strategy between these two processes. We discuss the results in terms of
   their evolutionary and ecological significance, and highlight future
   directions of research towards the understanding of dispersal strategies

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Question: Does liming mitigate carbon limitation to the original
   submerged vegetation of Norwegian softwater lakes?
   Location: Dybingsvatn (Dalane region, Southern Norway).
   Methods: Eight plots (1 m 2) were permanently marked in the deeper part
   (1.5 m) of the littoral zone of Dybingsvatn in 1994. Half of the plots
   were limed four times with dolocal (1 kgm- 2) in the period 1994-1998.
   Pore water, surface water chemistry and the occurrence of new plant
   species were monitored until 2008. In 2008, the composition and cover of
   the vegetation were estimated and the dominant isoetid plant species
   were harvested for determination of additional plant characteristics.
   Results: Liming lowered the redox potential of the sediment and led to
   higher concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon, Ca 2+, Mg 2+, Fe 2+
   and Mn 2+ in the sediment pore water. Submerged macrophytes that could
   in some way profit from the higher carbon dioxide concentrations
   developing in the pore water (e. g. Juncus bulbosus, Sparganium
   angustifolium and Callitriche hamulata) expanded or colonized the limed
   plots at different time-points. Four years of liming did not affect the
   cover and composition of the original isoetid vegetation, but led to
   development of taller and heavier plants with higher molar carbon to
   nitrogen ratios in the shoots, indicating a higher availability and
   uptake of carbon dioxide fromthe sediment.
   Conclusions: Liming leads to a higher availability of carbon dioxide in
   the sediment, partly owing to dissolution of carbonates, and partly by
   inducing anaerobic decomposition of organic matter and the consequent
   reduction of iron (IIII) hydroxides in the iron-rich sediment (in-lake
   alkalinity generation). All observed changes in the vegetation indicate
   that liming leads to mitigation of carbon dioxide limitation in
   Norwegian softwater lakes. Liming may be beneficial for fish populations
   by reducing concentrations of labile aluminium, but it does not preserve
   the characteristic chemical sediment properties and original vegetation
   of softwater lakes. We wish to point out that limingmay, in the worst
   case, lead to an alternative stable lake state with anaerobic sediments
   as relatively highly productive isoetid plant species have a risk of
   uprooting.}},

Abstract = {{Area of Occupancy (AOO), is a measure of species geographical ranges
   commonly used for species red listing. In most cases, AOO is estimated
   using reported localities of species distributions at coarse grain
   resolution, providing measures subjected to uncertainties of data
   quality and spatial resolution. To illustrate the ability of
   fine-resolution species distribution models for obtaining new measures
   of species ranges and their impact in conservation planning, we estimate
   the potential AOO of an endangered species in alpine environments. We
   use field occurrences of relict Empetrum nigrum and maximum entropy
   modeling to assess whether different sampling (expert versus systematic
   surveys) may affect AOO estimates based on habitat suitability maps, and
   the differences between such measurements and traditional coarse-grid
   methods. Fine-scale models performed robustly and were not influenced by
   survey protocols, providing similar habitat suitability outputs with
   high spatial agreement. Model-based estimates of potential AOO were
   significantly smaller than AOO measures obtained from coarse-scale
   grids, even if the first were obtained from conservative thresholds
   based on the Minimal Predicted Area (MPA). As defined here, the
   potential AOO provides spatially-explicit measures of species ranges
   which are permanent in the time and scarcely affected by sampling bias.
   The overestimation of these measures may be reduced using higher
   thresholds of habitat suitability, but standard rules as the MPA permit
   comparable measures among species. We conclude that estimates of AOO
   based on fine-resolution distribution models are more robust tools for
   risk assessment than traditional systems, allowing a better
   understanding of species ranges at habitat level. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The biodiversity of plankton ecosystems may no longer be a paradox, but
   the mechanisms that determine coexistence of explicit competitors in

   models, where competitive exclusion remains the dominant process.
   Climate and fisheries models require plankton ecosystem submodels that
   maintain competing plankton functional types extant, but coexistence can
   be reproduced in only a few `just so' theoretical models. This limits
   our ability to predict the impacts of climate change and fisheries on
   ocean biota. We consider ecosystems of Kolmogorov form that conserve
   mass (CK systems). These systems describe a general class of ecosystem
   models that includes many theoretical and applied models. We develop
   heuristics that illuminate the key mechanisms that allow the coexistence
   of explicit competitors in these systems. These heuristics facilitate
   the identification of a large class of models with the structural
   property that all species coexist for all time. Our approach unifies

Abstract = {{Across the globe, native savannas and woodlands are undergoing
   conversion to exotic grasslands. Here we summarize the current state of
   knowledge concerning the ecohydrological consequences of this conversion
   for the cold deserts (Great Basin, Colorado Plateau) and the warm
   deserts (Mojave, Sonoran, Chihuahuan) of North America. Our analysis is
   based on a synthesis of relevant literature, complemented by simulation
   modelling with a one-dimensional, soil water redistribution model
   (HYDRUS-1D) and a hillslope runoff and erosion model (MAHLERAN). When
   shrublands are invaded by grasses, many changes take place: rooting
   depths, canopy cover, species heterogeneity, water use, and fire regimes
   are radically altered. These changes then have the potential to alter
   key ecohydrological processes. With respect to the processes of runoff
   and erosion, we find that grass invasion influences cold and warm
   deserts in different ways. In cold deserts, runoff and erosion will
   increase following invasion; in particular, erosion on steep slopes
   (>15\%) will be greatly accelerated following burning. In addition,
   evapotranspiration (ET) will be lower and soil water recharge will be
   higherwhich after several decades could affect groundwater levels. For
   warm deserts, grass invasion may actually reduce runoff and erosion
   (except for periods immediately following fire), and is likely to have
   little effect on either ET fluxes or soil water. Significant gaps in our
   knowledge do remain, primarily because there have been no comprehensive
   studies measuring all components of the water and energy budgets at
   multiple scales. How these changes may affect regional energy budgets,
   and thus weather patterns, is not yet well understood. Copyright (C)

   point defined as the threshold of occurrence below which species are
   considered as being rare. This allows calculation of a rarity metric
   (index of relative rarity IRR) with multiple rarity cut-off points. 3.
   The proposed weighting method was used and compared with three
   previously proposed methods in a theoretical analysis. IRR values were
   then calculated for spider assemblages of a National Nature Reserve in
   France. Two methods of rankings were proposed: a local ranking between
   sites of the Nature Reserve, and a regional ranking in comparison to a
   reference database. 4. The proposed weighting method consistently
   weighted species according to the chosen rarity cut-offs. Species
   weights were less biased toward common species and rare species weights
   were less dispersed than with previous methods. Assemblages were
   consistently ranked according to the rarity of spiders in each
   assemblage. The index showed different patterns of rarity in assemblages
   which could not be detected by previous rarity metrics. 5. This method
   provides an improved understanding of assemblage rarity patterns
   relative to previous methods and can be consistently applied to other
   arthropod taxa in other geographic area and/ or spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{The role of predators in shaping prey life histories is a central theme
   in the ecological literature. However, the association between degree of
   predation risk and prey reproductive strategies has not been clearly
   established. We examined reproduction in the sailfin molly (Poecilia
   latipinna) from small tidal tributaries in a subtropical estuary. Our
   results revealed a gradient along which females produced many, small
   offspring at one extreme (mean = 42 offspring, 17 mg each) and fewer,
   larger offspring at the other (24 offspring, 29 mg each). Reproductive
   allotment ranged from 14.9-21.5\% of maternal biomass. Based on our
   observation of divergent reproductive strategies, we experimentally
   tested the null hypothesis of no difference in predation risk among
   tributaries using a novel quantitative approach to estimate predation.
   We predicted greater risk in tributaries where mollies produced many,
   small offspring. Tethering confirmed increasing risk from 16.2 +/- 5.3\%
   SE to 54.7 +/- 3.6\% fish lost h(-1) across sites in agreement with
   observed variation in reproduction. Predation was unexpectedly higher
   than predicted at one of the four sites suggesting that additional
   factors (e.g., food) had influenced reproduction there. Our results
   provide insight into the well-studied concept of predator-mediated
   variation in prey reproduction by quantitatively demonstrating
   differential risk for mollies exhibiting divergent reproductive
   strategies. While the observed range of variation in reproductive traits
   was consistent with previous studies reporting strong predator effects,
   higher than expected predation in one case may suggest that the prey
   response does not follow a continuous trajectory of incremental change
   with increasing predation risk, but may be better defined as a threshold
   beyond which a significant shift in reproductive strategy occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Forest ecosystems dominated by fire-sensitive species could suffer
   shifts in composition under altered crown fire regimes mediated by
   climate change. The aims of this study were to: (1) study the
   spatio-temporal patterns and the climatic distribution of fires in Scots
   pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests during the last 31 years in
   north-eastern Spain, (2) evaluate the climatic vulnerability to fire of
   these forests in Spain, (3) analyse the regeneration of Scots pine after
   fire, and (4) predict the mid-term maintenance or replacement of Scots
   pine in burned areas. Location Catalonia (north-eastern Spain): the
   southern distribution limit of Scots pine. Methods We characterized the
   spatio-temporal and the climatic distribution of fires that occurred in
   Catalonia between 1979 and 2009. We used a generalized linear model to
   characterize the climatic vulnerability to fire of Scots pine in the
   whole of Spain. We assessed the regeneration of the species after crown
   fires in nine burned areas in Catalonia. The resulting data were
   integrated into a stochastic matrix model to predict the mid-term
   maintenance or replacement of Scots pine in burned areas. Results During
   the last three decades, Scots pine forests distributed in dry sites were
   most affected by fire. Our assessment of the vulnerability to fire of
   Scots pine forests in Spain as a whole, based on climatic and
   topographical variables, showed that 32\% of these forests are
   vulnerable to fire, and that this proportion could increase to 66\%
   under a conservative climate change scenario. Field data showed almost
   no regeneration of Scots pine after crown fires, and a limited capacity
   to recolonize from unburned edges, even in relatively old fires, with
   90\% of recruits located in the first 25 m from the edge. This process
   could be delayed by the elapsed time for new recruits to achieve
   reproductive maturity, which we estimated to be c. 15 years. Finally,
   our matrix model predicted the replacement of burned Scots pine forests
   by oak (Quercus sp.) forests, shrublands or mixed resprouter forests.
   Main conclusions Increased vulnerability to fire of Scots pine forests
   under future, warmer conditions may result in vegetation shifts at the
   southern edge of the distribution of the species.}},
