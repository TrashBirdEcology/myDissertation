Title = {{The implications for visual simulation and analysis of temporal
   variation in the visibility of wind turbines}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{59-68}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The visual impact of wind turbines is a central issue in their public
   acceptance. New wind farm proposals are commonly subject to visual
   simulation and visual impact assessment. Guidelines for both these
   processes are already used in a number of jurisdictions and there is
   widespread interest in making simulation and impact assessments as
   meaningful as possible. To a large degree the guidelines for both
   processes tend to be based on worst-case (full-frontal) conditions.
   There are two quite good reasons for this. Firstly, the worst-case sets
   a boundary for visual impact. Secondly, we seldom know enough about how
   visibility or visual impact changes over time and what `typical'
   conditions are like - or how the range of conditions is distributed.
   This paper argues that if we can address this knowledge gap, then we may
   also be able to take a more nuanced approach to simulation and analysis.
   It should be possible, using widespread atmospheric visibility data, to
   determine the temporal distribution of visual impacts at a particular
   location rather computing a single estimate. It may also be valid to
   create simulations of both worst-case and more typical conditions. This
   paper explores the key variables affecting visual impacts - visual
   magnitude and color difference - and how they may be monitored and
   analyzed efficiently and effectively. A wind farm in southern Victoria,
   Australia is used as the case study. Recommendations are made on how the
   approaches could be used more widely.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The factors determining spatial distributions and diversity of
   terrestrial invertebrates are typically investigated at small scales.
   Large-scale studies are lacking for soil animals, which control
   microbial communities and represent one of the most diverse yet poorly
   known animal assemblages. Here, we analyzed a major group (Oribatida) to
   test whether belowground macroecological patterns can be predicted by
   climatic variables, vegetation and large-scale variation in key soil
   properties. Location We modelled the multivariate distribution of more
   than 100 species using biodiversity data collected across Great Britain
   in the framework of the Countryside Survey (). Methods We analyzed
   species-level data from 582 samples collected across 162 hectads (10 x
   10 km) covering the largest possible range of vegetation types, soil
   properties and climatic conditions within GB. We created the first
   large-scale maps of soil animal diversity metrics at the GB scale,
   including novel estimates of metrics of phylogenetic diversity (PD).
   Using structural equation modelling, we quantified the direct and
   indirect effects of location (latitude, longitude), plant community
   structure and abiotic factors such as precipitation on species
   composition, richness and PD. Results We found that variation in species
   composition follows a latitudinal gradient with diversity generally
   increasing northward. The latitudinal variation in species composition
   drives PD via changes in both species richness and phylogenetic distance
   between species. This gradient is mostly determined by latitudinal
   variation in precipitation and organic matter, which were very good
   predictors of species composition. Precipitation and organic matter
   were, however, relatively weak while statistically significant
   predictors of diversity metrics. Conclusions Past studies have
   emphasized the unpredictability of species distributions and variation
   in species composition in hyper diverse soil animal communities.
   However, past studies were conducted at small scales, where stochastic
   factors may weaken the signal of deterministic factors. Oribatid mites
   in our study show for the first time that the large scale latitudinal
   gradients in climate and organic matter predict not only variation in
   species composition but also taxonomic and PD of soil animal
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{The IUCN Red List criteria are a globally accepted method of assessing

   assessment of similar to 5000 currently unlisted NSW plant species
   against the thresholds for the geographic range criterion (Criterion B)
   to identify species which may require full assessment; and (2) A rapid
   assessment of currently listed threatened plant species, applying the

   identify species likely to be at the highest risk of extinction from

Abstract = {{This article presents a tool for developing novel law and governance

   Contemporary legal systems support perpetual economic growth, which

   a mutually enhancing human-Earth relationship in a limits-insistent
   systems framework is a more desirable overarching goal. Because law is a
   complex adaptive system that evolves with other systems, a systems-based
   assessment methodology can reveal the extent to which barriers to a
   mutually enhancing human-Earth relationship in law and governance and
   related systems are locked in and enduring elements of such a

   lock-in/lock-out can support development of strategies and priorities
   for shifting law and governance toward a mutually enhancing human-Earth
   relationship. This approach integrates leverage points for changing
   systems behavior and acknowledges path dependence that limits future
   possibilities. Relevant metrics and indicators are grounded in how human
   manipulation of material and energy affects Earth's life support

Abstract = {{Understanding how changes in biodiversity will impact the stability and
   functioning of ecosystems is a central challenge in ecology. Food web
   approaches have been advocated to link community composition with
   ecosystem functioning by describing the fluxes of energy among species
   or trophic groups. However, estimating such fluxes remain problematic
   because current methods become unmanageable as network complexity
   increases. We developed a generalization of previous indirect estimation
   methods assuming a steady-state system (Hunt et al., ); the model
   estimates energy fluxes in a top-down manner assuming system
   equilibrium; each node's losses (consumption and physiological) balances
   its consumptive gains. Jointly, we provide theoretical and practical
   guidelines to use the fluxweb R package (available on CRAN at
   https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/fluxweb/index.html). We also
   present how the framework can merge with the allometric theory of
   ecology (Brown, Gillooly, Allen, Savage, \& West, ; to calculate fluxes
   based on easily obtainable organism-level data (i.e., body masses and
   species groups-e.g., plants, animals), opening its use to food webs of
   all complexities. Physiological losses (metabolic losses or losses due
   to death other than from predation within the food web) may be directly
   measured or estimated using allometric relationships based on the
   metabolic theory of ecology, and losses and gains due to predation are a
   function of ecological efficiencies that describe the proportion of
   energy that is used for biomass production. The primary output is a
   matrix of fluxes among the nodes of the food web. These fluxes can be
   used to describe the role of a species, a function of interest (e.g.,
   predation; total fluxes to predators), multiple functions, or total
   energy flux (system throughflow or multitrophic functioning).
   Additionally, the package includes functions to calculate network
   stability based on the Jacobian matrix, providing insight into how
   resilient the network is to small perturbations at steady state.
   Overall, fluxweb provides a flexible set of functions that greatly
   increase the feasibility of implementing food web energetic approaches
   to more complex systems. As such, the package facilitates novel
   opportunities for mechanistically linking quantitative food webs and
   ecosystem functioning in real and dynamic natural landscapes.}},

Title = {{Asymmetric interactions and their consequences for vital rates and
   dynamics: the smaller tea tortrix as a model system}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Asymmetric interactions among conspecifics can have diverse effects on
   population dynamics including stabilization, generation of cycles, and
   induction of chaotic fluctuations. A difficult challenge, however, is
   establishing the link between the impact of asymmetric interactions on
   life history and the consequences for population dynamics. The smaller
   tea tortrix, Adoxophyes honmai, is a good example. Larval instars differ
   dramatically in size and have a tendency for cannibalism, which suggests
   the potential for strong asymmetric interactions among instars. Yet
   whether these asymmetries have any role in generating the distinct
   single-generation cycles observed in the field and laboratory is
   unclear. Here we report on the development of a new experimental
   approach to characterize the impact of asymmetric interactions on life
   history that can be directly embedded into stage-structured population
   models. The experiments use donor-replacement protocols in which focal
   individuals are challenged to complete their life cycles in competitive
   environments where the instar and density of the competitors are held
   constant. The experimentally derived interaction surface contains all
   the information about stage-specific interactions and provides a
   straightforward framework for evaluating alternative ways of abstracting
   the interactions into traditional models of asymmetric competition.
   Working with the smaller tea tortrix, we found strong evidence of
   asymmetric interactions and identified critical ``tipping points{''} in
   the competitive environment that strongly affected survival but not
   development. We incorporated the experimentally derived interaction
   surface into a stage-structured population model and found that despite
   the strong impact that asymmetric interactions have on tea tortrix life
   history, they do not scale-up to impact the predicted asymptotic
   population dynamics. Comparing these dynamics with two abstracted models
   of stage-structured interactions revealed that while the quantitative
   details of the emergent dynamics depends on the shape of the interaction
   surface, the qualitative features, such as the emergence of
   single-generation cycles and rapid synchronization of development among
   individuals, are pleasingly robust.}},

Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Infectious diseases are rapidly emerging and many are increasing in
   incidence across the globe. Processes of land-use change, notably
   habitat loss and fragmentation, have been widely implicated in the
   emergence and spread of zoonoses such as Lyme disease, yet evidence
   remains equivocal. Here, we discuss and apply an innovative approach
   from the social sciences; instrumental variables, which seeks to tease
   out causality from observational data. Using this approach, we revisit
   the effect of forest fragmentation on Lyme disease incidence, focusing
   on human interaction with fragmented landscapes. Although human
   interaction with infected ticks is of clear and fundamental importance
   to human disease incidence, human activities that influence exposure
   have been largely overlooked in ecology literature. Using county-level
   land-use and Lyme disease incidence data for similar to 800 counties
   from the northeastern United States over the span of a decade, we
   illustrate (a) that human interaction with fragmented forest landscapes
   reliably predicts Lyme disease incidence, while ecological measures of
   forest fragmentation alone are unreliable predictors and (b) that
   identifying the effect of forest fragmentation on human disease entails
   addressing the feedback between Lyme disease risk and human decisions to
   avoid interaction with high-risk landscapes. Synthesis and applications.
   Our innovative approach and novel results help to clarify the equivocal
   literature on the effects of forest fragmentation on Lyme disease and
   illustrate the key role that human behaviour may be playing in the
   ecology of Lyme disease in North America. Accounting for human activity
   and behaviour in the ecology of disease more broadly may result in
   improved understanding of both the ecological drivers of disease, as
   well as actionable intervention strategies to reduce disease burden in a
   changing world. For example, our model results indicate that forest
   fragmentation by human settlement increases Lyme disease incidence,
   which has practical implications for land-use policy aimed at disease
   reduction. Specifically, our model suggests land-use regulations that
   reduce parcel size would be an actionable approach to reduce Lyme
   disease transmission for policymakers concerned about increasing Lyme
   disease incidence in the northeastern United States.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive plant eradication aims to restore an original state by
   eliminating the plant and its alteration of ecosystem structure and
   function. The method by which an invasive plant is eradicated is known
   to influence restoration success; however, success may be impeded by a

   community assembly responded to the eradication of an invasive
   nitrogen-fixing legume, Lupinus arboreus, using three different
   techniques. We applied herbicide to six mature plants and with a handsaw
   removed the above ground biomass of 12 mature plants; six of these were
   left in situ to decompose and six were removed from site. Soil nutrient
   concentrations were measured, and plant community composition was
   monitored, in the treatment and reference plots over the following
   13months. Eradication resulted in a significant increase in extractable
   ammonium-N and potassium, in contrast nitrate-N declined. The plant
   community changed as a result of felling L. arboreus, and the removal of
   all biomass initially resulted in an increase in native plant cover. By
   the end of the experimental period, however, L. arboreus seedlings were
   increasing in abundance and native cover was declining. The application
   of herbicide resulted in the slow decay of the mature plant and as such
   delayed an increase in exotic species cover and inhibited L. arboreus
   germination. Nutrient concentrations in the eradication plots were not
   significantly different from the reference plots at the end of the
   experimental period. The impact of L. arboreus on the soil nutrient pool
   remains after eradication, a legacy effect which will hinder restoration
   of the original structure and function in the long term.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{219-230}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Coastal ecosystems support the livelihoods and wellbeing of millions of
   people worldwide. However, the marine and terrestrial ecosystem services
   that coastal ecosystems provide are particularly vulnerable to global
   environmental change, as are the coastal communities who directly depend
   on them. To navigate these changes and ensure the wellbeing of coastal
   communities, policy-makers must know which coastal ecosystem services
   matter to whom, and why. Yet, in developing coastal settings, capturing
   people's perceptions of the importance of ecosystem services is
   challenging for several reasons. Firstly, coastal ecosystem services
   encompass both terrestrial and marine services across multiple
   categories (i.e. provisioning, supporting, and cultural) that are
   difficult to value together. Secondly, widely used monetary valuation
   techniques are often inappropriate because of culturally specific
   attributions of value, and the intangible nature of key cultural
   ecosystem services. Thirdly, people within communities may hold
   different ecosystem services values. In this paper, we examine how
   people ascribe and explain the importance of a range of marine and
   terrestrial ecosystem services in three coastal communities in Papua New
   Guinea. We use a mixed-methods approach that combines a non-monetary
   ranking and rating assessment of multiple ecosystem services, with a
   socio-economic survey (N = 139) and qualitative explanations of why
   ecosystem services matter. We find that people uniformly ascribe the
   most importance to marine and terrestrial provisioning services that
   directly support their livelihoods and material wellbeing. However,
   within communities, gender, wealth, and years of formal schooling do
   shape some differences in how people rate ecosystem services. In
   addition, although cultural ecosystem services were often rated lower,
   people emphasized that they ranked provisioning services highly, in
   part, because of their contribution to cultural values like bequest.
   People also expressed concern about extractive ecosystem services, like
   fuelwood, that were perceived to be destructive, and were rated low. We
   contend that comprehensive ecosystem services assessments that include
   narratives can capture the broad importance of a range of ecosystem
   services, alongside relational values and normative judgements. This
   exploratory approach is a useful step towards understanding the
   complexities of ecosystem services in developing coastal settings.}},

Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{268-275}},

Abstract = {{The impact of the Three Gorges Dam on the downstream flow regime and
   carp communities is assessed through a systematic examination of various
   indicators of hydrology (IHs) recorded during the pre-and post-dam
   periods. Specifically, the Spearman correlation method is used to
   identify a number of key indicators better correlated with carp
   population changes. The range of variability approach (RVA) is then
   applied to these key IHs to calculate their degree of alteration after
   the dam impoundment. Also, a new composite index is proposed here to
   determine the most important IHs. This index quantifies the relative
   impact among the competing indicators by accounting for both their
   alteration and correlation levels. It is observed that the presence of
   Three Gorges Dam disrupts the natural flow patterns and limits the
   downstream areas to small-scale, short-lived flow events. These flow
   events are insufficient regarding both the magnitude and duration to
   satisfy the carps' breeding needs. Among 32 IHs considered here,
   high-pulse duration and rise rate of discharge or water level are found
   to be the most important flow properties for the carps' spawning
   success; at the same time, they are the worst affected by the dam
   presence. Other indicators, such as base flow discharge and fall rate of
   discharge, also play a role, as they are adversely affecting the carp
   fry biomass. The present results are very useful for designing water
   releases that will be effective in improving the breeding conditions and
   augmenting the overall carp population.}},

Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{567-578}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Fish responses to hydropeaking may range from sub-organismal adjustments
   to key life-event changes. It is currently difficult to quantify these
   responses and to assess the potential of artificial refuges accordingly.
   To address this problem, two experimental trials were conducted in an
   indoor flume. In the first, two hydropeaking events were tested in the
   presence of deflectors as flow refuges. In the second, the presence and
   absence of deflectors was tested for the same hydropeaking event. A
   multidisciplinary approach combined physiological and movement behaviour
   responses of Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) with hydrodynamic
   models. These were used as a complementary tool to explain the fish
   responses. In the first experiment, no evident physiological adjustments
   occurred. However, individual refuge use and swimming activity were
   higher in the single-step event where velocities above 0.6 m.s(-1) were
   observed. In the second experiment, the levels of glucose were the
   highest in the repeated single-step event with deflectors, whereas in
   their absence no visible changes were observed. The sequence of
   discharges affected the frequency of individual sprints and group
   drifts, particularly evident with deflectors. Additionally, the
   deflector use increased in the first peak in opposition to the second.
   Overall, the fish responses were indicative that the low velocity areas
   (< 0.1 m.s(-1)) existing behind the deflectors were favourable under
   hydropeaking conditions. However, the flow complexity resulting from the
   presence of deflectors impaired their ability to successfully find them.
   The integrated approach used in this study provided novel insight
   considering the responses of cyprinids to hydropeaking in the presence
   and absence of deflectors as a mitigation measure. This study emphasized
   the importance of characterizing the hydrodynamic conditions due to
   hydropeaking, particularly after including the artificial refuges.}},

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Non-indigenous species (NIS) invasions are global phenomena that are the
   main drivers for ecosystem change and can often drastically affect the
   structure and function of novel ecosystems. Early detection is of prime
   importance for preventing the establishment and potential dispersal of
   NIS, making eradication and control more efficient and less costly since
   the species is present at very low densities. However, species at low
   density generally require intensive sampling efforts to be detected.
   An important shortcut to reduce sampling effort is to analyze
   environmental DNA (eDNA). Eukaryotic organisms leave traces of their
   presence in the environment where they live. In environments that are
   difficult to access, such as aquatic environments, DNA present in the
   water can be extracted and amplified using PCR target markers to
   identify the species that inhabit therein. Using species-specific
   markers, the presence of target species' DNA from water samples can be
   detected using PCR and simple electrophoresis in agarose gel. This is an
   efficient and convenient approach when the target species is known that
   puts the focus on detection. However, a critical challenge of this
   methodology is the design of appropriate species-specific markers. They
   must be specific to one target species, without any cross-amplification
   even in close species. For this purpose, a DNA database with as many
   different species, genetic markers and haplotypes as possible is
   essential for genetic marker design. The principal aim of this work is
   to analyze the state-of-the-art of the databases, in this case GenBank,
   which is the most complete database in number of markers and species, in
   order to assess its utility in the design of speciesspecific primers for
   invasive species early detection.}},

Abstract = {{ContextPredicting ecosystem resilience is a challenge, especially as
   climate change alters disturbance regimes and conditions for recovery.
   Recent research has highlighted the importance of spatially-explicit
   disturbance and resilience processes to long-term ecosystem dynamics.
   Neoecological approaches characterize resilience mechanisms at
   relatively fine spatio-temporal resolutions, but results are difficult
   to extrapolate across broad temporal scales or climatic ranges.
   Paleoecological methodologies can consider the effects of climates that
   differ from today. However, they are often limited to coarse-grained
   spatio-temporal resolutions.MethodsIn this synthesis, we describe
   implicit and explicit examples of studies that incorporate both neo- and
   paleoecological approaches. We propose ways to build on the strengths of
   both approaches in an explicit and proactive fashion.ResultsLinking the
   two approaches is a powerful way to surpass their respective
   limitations. Aligning spatial scales is critical: Paleoecological
   sampling design should incorporate knowledge of the spatial
   characteristics of the disturbance process, and neoecological studies
   benefit from a longer-term context to their conclusions. In some cases,
   modeling can incorporate non-spatial data from paleoecological records
   or emerging spatial paleo-data networks with mechanistic
   disturbance/recovery processes that operate at fine spatiotemporal
   scales.ConclusionsLinking these two complementary approaches is a
   powerful way to build a complete understanding of ecosystem disturbance

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Increased environmental stochasticity due to climate change will
   intensify temporal variance in the life-history traits, and especially
   breeding probabilities, of long-lived iteroparous species. These changes
   may decrease individual fitness and population viability and is
   therefore important to monitor. In wild animal populations with
   imperfect individual detection, breeding probabilities are best
   estimated using capture-recapture methods. However, in many vertebrate
   species (e.g., amphibians, turtles, seabirds), nonbreeders are
   unobservable because they are not tied to a territory or breeding
   location. Although unobservable states can be used to model temporary
   emigration of nonbreeders, there are disadvantages to having
   unobservable states in capture-recapture models. The best solution to
   deal with unobservable life-history states is therefore to eliminate
   them altogether. Here, we achieve this objective by fitting novel
   multievent-robust design models which utilize information obtained from
   multiple surveys conducted throughout the year. We use this approach to
   estimate annual breeding probabilities of capital breeding female
   elephant seals (Mirounga leonina). Conceptually, our approach parallels
   a multistate version of the Barker/robust design in that it combines
   robust design capture data collected during discrete breeding seasons
   with observations made at other times of the year. A substantial
   advantage of our approach is that the nonbreeder state became observable
   when multiple data sources were analyzed together. This allowed us to
   test for the existence of state-dependent survival (with some support
   found for lower survival in breeders compared to nonbreeders), and to
   estimate annual breeding transitions to and from the nonbreeder state
   with greater precision (where current breeders tended to have higher
   future breeding probabilities than nonbreeders). We used program E-SURGE
   (2.1.2) to fit the multievent-robust design models, with uncertainty in
   breeding state assignment (breeder, nonbreeder) being incorporated via a
   hidden Markov process. This flexible modeling approach can easily be
   adapted to suit sampling designs from numerous species which may be
   encountered during and outside of discrete breeding seasons.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific trait variation within natural populations (i.e.
   intra-population trait variation, IPTV) is the basic source for
   selection and can have significant ecological consequences. Higher IPTV
   may increase a population's niche breath and benefit interspecies
   competition under a resource-limited environment, thus affecting the
   ability of a species to move into novel habitats. However, the
   reciprocal influences of variation in environmental conditions and
   phenotypic trait expression in spreading plant populations are not
   clearly defined. We propose that during invasion, IPTV and its relative
   change in response to key resource enrichment may increase with the
   resource deficit of invaded sites, and that this relationship may
   facilitate plant invasions into resource-limited environments. We
   analyzed the invasion trend, IPTV and its response to water enrichment,
   and moisture variability among populations of an annual grass
   Brachypodium hybridum in California, United States. We incorporated a
   genotyping-by-sequencing approach, a common garden experiment that had
   two water level treatments, and public plant and climate databases. Our
   hypothesis was supported by the observation that for populations that
   invaded sites with higher spring moisture deficit, both their seed
   biomass IPTV (for the water-enriched treatment only) and relative change
   of the IPTV across water treatments were larger when examined in the
   common garden experiment. A generally north to south spreading direction
   was found in these B. hybridum populations, towards a drier and warmer
   climate exhibiting higher moisture deficit for plant growth. Our results
   suggest a role for interactions between IPTV (rather than trait means)
   and environmental resource availability in promoting plant invasions,

Abstract = {{Tropical phenology is characterized by its high diversity. Lacking a
   cool season that restricts growth, phenological cycles vary from species
   that reproduce multiple times per year to those that reproduce only once
   in several years even within a community. As such, environmental cues of
   phenological events are more diverse among species and communities of
   tropical organisms compared with those in higher latitudes.
   Community-wide phenological patterns differ among regions that differ in
   climate patterns and biogeographical backgrounds. These patterns are
   increasingly revealed as long-term phenology data accumulate especially
   for tree species at long-term monitoring sites. Advances in analytical
   methods applied to sufficiently long-term data sets generate novel
   insights. Long-term data are also critically important for understanding
   how climate changes affect phenological patterns and consequently
   species interactions and biological diversity. Particularly important is
   to understand how changes in drought regimes, both in terms of frequency
   and intensity, may affect plant phenology, and consequently have
   cascading impacts on tropical forest communities. To effectively link
   phenology studies and management of tropical forests and their ecosystem
   services in future studies, we should not only continue observation at

Title = {{Marsh bird occupancy along the shoreline-to-forest gradient as marshes
   migrate from rising sea level}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{One mechanism by which coastal marshes may persist as sea-level rises is
   to expand landward into existing forest, a process known as marsh
   migration. Though recent studies highlight the importance of marsh
   migration to the conservation of birds associated with coastal marshes,
   marsh bird responses to this transition from forest to marsh are poorly
   understood. To address this need, we conducted surveys of five focal
   marsh bird taxa at 92 points distributed across the gradient from the
   shoreline to the marsh-forest interface in one of the most vulnerable
   regions to sea-level rise in North America where marshes have been
   migrating landward for at least several decades. Given this landward
   movement of the forest-marsh interface, we modeled focal taxa occurrence
   as a function of distance-to-forest, thereby assuming that marshes
   closer to the forest were newer than those closer to the shoreline. In
   addition, we investigated the effects of vegetation conditions and fire
   frequency. Occupancy probability of marsh birds decreased closer to the
   forest-marsh interface where woody vegetation was taller and herbaceous
   cover was dominated by Cladium jamaicense, suggesting migrated marsh may
   provide limited habitat for these bird species, at least in the short
   term. Though parameter estimate uncertainty for black rail (Laterallus
   jamaicensis) was high due to a limited number of detections, occupancy
   of this species may increase with the conditions associated with
   migrated marsh, specifically greater C. jamaicense dominance and
   decreasing distance-to-forest. Clapper/king rail (Rallus
   crepitans/elegans) occupancy was greater at sites that had burned more
   frequently over the past decade, and occupancy of all focal taxa was
   greater in areas with vegetation conditions consistent with the effects
   of fire in coastal marshes, including reduced herbaceous vegetation
   density and shorter woody vegetation. As such, prescribed fire may serve
   as an effective method of facilitating marsh migration and increasing
   the quality and quantity of habitat for coastal marsh birds as sea-level
   rises.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Recent and rapid warming is reorganizing terrestrial vegetation,
   creating novel species assemblages, and shifting range limits. Relative
   to the evergreen species that currently dominate much of the boreal
   forest landscape, Larix (larch) distributions may be particularly
   responsive to climatic change due to their deciduous habit, and quick
   growth and reproduction. Here, we amassed data from 83 studies to
   describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under
   contemporary climate change. Location Northern hemisphere. Taxon Species
   of the genus Larix, deciduous gymnosperms. Methods With 181 observations
   of Larix range limit dynamics, we used five distribution parameters
   (tree line advance, stand infilling, tree line recession, stand
   thinning, no response) and their determinants (climate, land use change,
   natural disturbance) to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix
   range shifts under contemporary climate change. We ran a redundancy
   analysis on the matrix of five distribution parameters considered with
   other climatic and nonclimatic parameters as explanatory variables. We
   also characterized the climatic niche of Larix species (temperature and
   precipitation) and how the niche has changed during the 20th century.
   Results Of 173 sites studied over the full distribution of Larix, 63\%
   experienced Larix population increases, 18\% had population decreases,
   and no response was detected at 19\% of sites. Latitudinal Larix tree
   lines in Siberia and North America appear to be infilling and shifting
   their distributions northward, whereas Larix recession and thinning was
   more common in southern regions, suggesting southern populations may be
   experiencing greater drought stress than their northern counterparts.
   Climatic niches of most Larix species shifted towards warmer and wetter
   conditions, with tree line advance/forest infilling in cool/dry climate
   space, and recession/thinning in warm/dry space. Main conclusions
   Northern expansion is underway or seems imminent for boreal Larix
   species, primarily L. laricina in North America. Retraction in southern
   regions and disappearance of some mountainous populations may be
   inevitable due to their narrow ecological niches. Species restricted to
   mountainous habitats may expand locally, though will likely not
   contribute to broad scale range expansion. These changes will depend on
   suitable climate, disturbance, and dispersal mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Palaeoecological records indicate that Pleistocene glaciations

   Results Five plastid phylogroups of G. suaveolens occur in parapatry
   throughout Central Africa, following a spatial pattern generally
   congruent with genetic clusters. Four of them diverged 3.5-4.5 Ma,

Abstract = {{Climate change is already resulting in changes in cold desert
   ecosystems, lending urgency to the need to understand climate change
   effects and develop effective adaptation strategies. In this review, we
   synthesize information on changes in climate and hydrologic processes
   during the past century for the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau and
   discuss future projections for the 21st century. We develop midcentury
   projections of temperature and climate for the Great Basin and Columbia
   Plateau at timescales relevant to managers (2020-2050) and discuss
   concepts and strategies for adapting to the projected changes. For the
   instrumented record in the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau (1985-2011),
   a temperature increase of 0.7 -1.4 degrees C has been documented, but
   changes in precipitation have been relatively minor with no clear
   trends. Climate projections for 2020-2050 indicate that temperatures
   will continue to increase, especially in winter and during the night.
   Precipitation is more difficult to project, and estimates range from an
   11\% decrease to 25\% increase depending on location. Recent records
   indicate that the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau are becoming more
   arid, a trend that is projected to continue. Droughts are likely to
   become more frequent and last longer, invasive annual grasses are likely
   to continue to expand, and the duration and severity of wildfire seasons
   are likely to increase. Climate projections can help in developing
   adaptive management strategies for actual or expected changes in
   climate. Strategies include reducing the risks of nonnative invasive
   plant spread and wildfires that result in undesirable transitions,
   planning for drought, and where necessary, facilitating the transition
   of populations, communities, and ecosystems to new climatic conditions.

Abstract = {{Does disturbance increase or decrease parasite transmission among
   wildlife hosts? Ecologists cannot answer this controversial question, in
   part because few historical datasets rigorously document parasite
   abundance. Without such a baseline, it is difficult to determine whether
   contemporary ecosystems are experiencing elevated parasite burdens.
   Here, we investigate change over time in the abundance of a parasite
   that affects the economic value of a fish species. Clavinema mariae is a
   nematode parasite of benthic fishes that is common in English sole
   (Parophrys vetulus) of Puget Sound, WA. We obtained historical records
   of its abundance from the literature and from unpublished government
   agency data, and resampled the same locations using the same methods in
   2017. We also used a new approach by estimating the C. mariae burden for
   museum specimens of English sole collected between 1930 and 2016. Both
   the historical data and museum specimen data suggested increases over
   time in C. mariae abundance, with robust agreement between the two
   approaches. In addition to documenting a previously unrecognised similar
   to eightfold increase in the burden of an economically important
   parasite, our work demonstrates-for the first time-that parasitological
   examination of liquid-preserved museum specimens can produce reliable
   data on long-term trends in parasite abundance, at a much greater
   temporal resolution than is possible to obtain from historical records.
   Synthesis and applications. Defining a baseline state of infection is
   vital for natural resource management and policy, which must respond to
   the threat of disease; without such a baseline, managers attempting to
   maintain or recover the health of ecosystems under their stewardship are
   shooting in the dark. The method we present here-using museum specimens
   to reconstruct detailed chronologies of parasite abundance change-offers
   a solution. Our approach would allow managers to accurately characterise
   past disease states, informing the development of appropriate disease
   management targets. Given the broad representation and availability of
   liquid-preserved specimens across ecosystems, geographic regions and
   host taxa, this solution may be feasible for the management of
   biological resources not only in marine ecosystems, but in freshwater
   and terrestrial ecosystems as well.}},

Abstract = {{Seagrass decline is often related to eutrophication, with sudden and

   nearshore, indicating a threshold for this species in the higher end of
   the values reported here. In contrast, Amphibolis spp. were selectively
   lost further offshore, suggesting a lower threshold for the onset of
   fragmentation and decline. Nitrogen pressure was concentrated over the
   wetter months of the year between late autumn and early spring. Pulsed
   pressure peaking in August likely affected thresholds by reducing

Abstract = {{Discerning the determinants of species occurrence across landscapes is
   fundamental to their conservation and management. In spatially and
   climatologically complex landscapes, explaining the dynamics of
   occurrence can lead to improved understanding of short- vs. long-term
   trends and offer novel insight on local vs. regional change. We examined
   the changes in occupancy for two species of anurans with different life
   histories over a decade using hundreds of wetland sites in Yellowstone
   and Grand Teton National Parks. To account for the joint dynamics of
   wetland drying and amphibian breeding, we adopted a multistate occupancy
   model as a means to investigate mechanistic relationships of observed
   occurrence patterns with climatological drivers of wetland hydrologic
   variability. This approach allowed us to decompose occupancy dynamics
   into habitat changes caused by wetland drying and amphibian breeding
   activity, conditional on available water and previous breeding state.
   Over our 10-yr time series, we observed considerable variability in
   climate drivers and the proportion of dry wetlands. Boreal chorus frogs
   (Pseudacris maculata) were more responsive to changes in wetland
   inundation status than Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris), as
   indicated by higher breeding colonization probabilities under favorable
   (wet) conditions. Both species had high probabilities of breeding
   persistence in permanently inundated wetlands with prior breeding.
   Despite the absence of multi-year drought in our time series,
   mechanistic relationships described here offer insights on how future
   climate variation may result in reduced and/or shifted occurrence
   patterns for pond-breeding anurans in the Greater Yellowstone Area.
   Further, our modeling approach may prove valuable in evaluating
   determinants of occurrence for other species that are dependent on
   wetlands or other dynamic habitats.}},

   traditional GIS-based approach is criticized for inappropriately
   specifying geographic units and threshold distances, and for ignoring
   people's self-movement. This research proposes a novel approach,
   emphasizing the actual park users' activities, both spatially and
   temporally. We took advantage of the large dataset available from mobile
   phones to analyze billions of anonymized data samples in order to
   characterize the behavioral patterns of millions of people who accessed
   green space in an experimental procedure. We chose Shanghai as the case
   study because residential segregation had occurred expected to be
   accompanied by issues of environmental justice. The results found that
   social equity could be achieved, even where territorial inequity was
   manifest in a high-population-density context that is undergoing rapid
   urban growth and transition. Shanghai's vulnerable groups are not found
   to be unequally treated at present, but there are warning signs that
   market mechanisms may worsen the uneven development. Therefore, the
   local municipalities are required to rethink how to provide green
   infrastructure to different social groups, responding to the inequality
   and uneven development that capital can bring.}},

Abstract = {{People's perceptions of the built environment influence the way they use

   several studies have used data collected at a massive scale and machine

   the difficulty associated with identifying the importance of each

   quantify perceptions of landscapes through discrete choice models, using
   semantic segmentations of images of public spaces, generated through
   machine learning algorithms, as explanatory variables. The proposed
   models are estimated using the Place Pulse dataset, with over 1.2
   million perceptual indicators, and are able to provide useful insights

Abstract = {{Background
   The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the most widely used
   information source on the extinction risk of species. One of the uses of
   the Red List is to evaluate and monitor the state of biodiversity and a
   possible approach for this purpose is the Red List Index (RLI). For many
   taxa, mainly hyperdiverse groups, it is not possible within available
   resources to assess all known species. In such cases, a random sample of
   species might be selected for assessment and the results derived from it
   extrapolated for the entire group - the Sampled Red List Index (SRLI).
   The current contribution is the final in four papers that will
   constitute the baseline of a future spider SRLI encompassing 200 species
   distributed across the world.
   New information
   A sample of 200 species of spiders were randomly selected from the World
   Spider Catalogue, an updated global database containing all recognised
   species names for the group. The selected species were classified
   taxonomically at the family level and the familes were ordered
   alphabetically. In this publication, we present the conservation
   profiles of 50 species belonging to the families alphabetically arranged
   between Scytodidae and Zoropsidae, which encompassed Scytodidae,

   `state of the watershed' reporting). This study offers an evaluation of
   watershed-scale aquatic monitoring and reporting and provides concrete
   examples from the case study. We test a new process for refining,
   selecting, or prioritizing indicators for aquatic monitoring. Cumulative

Abstract = {{Aims
   This study aimed to examine the changes in plant species richness,
   frequency and density along a habitat fragmentation gradient (with
   varied degrees of habitat fragmentation {[}DHFs]) in a desertified
   grassland of Horqin Sandy Land, northeastern Inner Mongolia, China.
   Methods
   In this study, six landscape plots (500 x 500 m each) along a habitat
   fragmentation gradient were established. A new fragmentation index was
   formulated to study the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity
   indices (species richness, frequency and density). Regression analyses
   (linear- or non-linear regression) were conducted to assess the changes
   in species richness, frequency and density along the habitat
   fragmentation gradient at plant community, functional group and species
   scales, respectively.
   Important Findings
   There was a non-linear relationship (following a quadratic function)
   between total species richness and the DHF. Total species richness
   reached its peak when the DHF was 0.2, beyond which species richness
   decreased along the fragmentation gradient. Plant functional groups
   showed their specific responses to habitat fragmentation, and some
   non-linear relationships and thresholds existed. The relative richness
   of rare species also showed a non-linear response to habitat
   fragmentation, with the threshold being DHF = 0.6. Species became rarer
   (both some common species and rare species) with the intensifying
   habitat fragmentation. Our study demonstrates the importance of the
   non-linear relationships and plant functional groups in exploring the
   effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity and implementing
   effective biological conservation in sand dunes.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{281-288}},

Abstract = {{Testing the full impact of neighbourhood crowding within natural
   vegetation requires more than just effects incurred by established
   plants. It must also include measurements that take into account
   suppressive effects on the earliest plant life stages of resident
   individuals - seeds, their germination (emergence of radicles and
   cotyledons), and very young rooted seedlings. In this study, we explored
   the potential for these effects in a field experiment spanning three
   years, using a novel design for controlling granivory and small mammal
   herbivory. This allowed us to assess the limitations of natural crowding
   on seed recruitment success for non-resident species introduced into
   both natural and denuded neighbourhood plots within a temperate mesic
   old field meadow in eastern Ontario, Canada. Our results show that
   crowding by standing vegetation of resident species caused an overall
   reduction of seed recruitment success by more than 90\%. These data
   provide strong inference that suppression resulting directly from near
   neighbour effects are likely to impose routinely intense natural
   selection within temperate mesic old field habitats like our study site.
   The consequences of this selection, in terms of traits promoting plant
   fitness under competition, are traditionally interpreted in terms of
   superior resource depletion/uptake, typically associated with greater
   growth accumulation and larger potential body size. We suggest, however,
   that these consequences are rare. Individuals of any species approach
   maximum potential body size only when near neighbour effects are
   relatively weak - not within crowded neighbourhoods. Recent studies
   suggest that severe neighbourhood crowding (where virtually all resident
   plants are forced to remain relatively small) selects instead for
   `reproductive economy' - i.e., capacity to produce at least a few (or
   even at least one) offspring despite severe body size suppression,
   involving a relatively small minimum reproductive threshold size.
   Potential for additional component traits of reproductive economy are
   also suggested for investigation in future research.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrological changes due to climate change will impact the
   sustainability of social-ecological systems (SES). It is essential to
   develop methodologies, capable of addressing economic as well as the
   environmental aspects, to take care of the water-associated system
   through improving the system adaptive capacity, particularly in arid and
   semi-arid areas. Through the application of the Post-Modern Portfolio
   Theory (PMPT), we propose a new approach to water allocation problem in
   the face of climate change, as a case of Lake Tashk-Bakhtegan basin,
   Southern Iran. The economic model based on PMPT is adapted for designing
   water allocation schemes to maximize local economic return, minimize its
   risk and minimize the Gini coefficient indicative of social inequities.
   The climatic variables were generated by three Atmosphere-Ocean General
   Circulation Models. The temperature and precipitation will increase and
   decrease by about +2.4\% and -10\% on average in the future compared to
   those in the historical period, respectively. In order to identify
   hydrological and socio-economic implications of climate change in the
   basin, an integrated system dynamic model was developed. Finally, the
   decision space of equally effective solutions has been determined in the
   form of Pareto points at the efficient portfolio plane. The findings
   showed a decrease in the economic return (on average by 5.7\% in the
   both RCPs) and the ratio of employment to unemployment (average 10\% in
   most of sub-basin), owing to the reduction of water resources,
   especially in agriculture. Base on Portfolio results, the ratio of
   economic return to risk doubled and tripled in optimized condition
   compared to the normal condition in the future. The efficient plane of
   the portfolio can be used to allocate water to economic activities
   according to a risk-taking attitude of a decision-maker. Following the
   model results, services and industrial sectors would need to be
   developed in order to sustain local water resources with possible
   additional allocations for environmental requirements, with simultaneous
   improvement of economic return on water resources. (C) 2018 Published by

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Forest restoration has potential to recover degraded ecosystem functions
   in disturbed environments. Decomposition and denitrification are two
   critical functions involved in forest nutrient cycling that are often
   compromised in degraded ecosystems. As forest canopy structure develops
   following initial plantings, it may indirectly impact ecosystem
   functions by altering abiotic conditions. It is likely, however, that
   there are other abiotic factors that affect decomposition and
   denitrification that are unrelated to forest canopy structure. Here, we
   aimed to determine whether forest canopy openness, topography, and soil
   sand content would affect litter decomposition and denitrification by
   regulating the microclimate, the herbaceous plant layer, soil chemistry,
   and soil moisture. Research occurred in restored native temperate
   rainforest patches in two New Zealand cities. Urban forests are an
   excellent context for measuring impact of canopy restoration on
   ecosystem properties such as microclimate due to the extreme swings in
   city conditions (e.g., urban heat island). Decomposition rates were
   determined using leaf litter bags and denitrification rates through
   denitrification enzyme activity assays. We used structural equation
   modeling to quantify the direct and indirect drivers of these ecosystem
   functions. Results indicated that decomposition rates were positively
   related to soil moisture, relative humidity, and herbaceous plant cover.
   Interestingly, forest canopy openness indirectly affected decomposition
   through counteracting forces, meaning greater canopy openness in young
   forests permitted dense herbaceous plant growth which enhanced
   decomposition, while less canopy openness in older forests enhanced
   humidity levels which increased decomposition. Denitrification was
   negatively related to soil pH and positively related to soil moisture,
   but these abiotic factors were unrelated to the forest canopy.
   Discovering drivers of ecosystem functions can improve approaches to the
   restoration of degraded ecosystems, especially in disturbed urban areas.
   Identifying counteracting effects on ecosystem functions could improve
   management by focusing restoration actions on specific drivers to elicit
   desired changes. Some ecosystem processes, like denitrification, are not
   affected by forest canopy restoration or management, but are instead
   driven by edaphic and landscape factors.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation regimes are changing in response to climate change, yet
   understanding of how forest ecosystems respond to extreme droughts and
   pluvials remains incomplete. As future precipitation extremes will
   likely fall outside the range of historical variability, precipitation
   manipulation experiments (PMEs) are critical to advancing knowledge
   about potential ecosystem responses. However, few PMEs have been
   conducted in forests compared to short-statured ecosystems, and forest
   PMEs have unique design requirements and constraints. Moreover, past
   forest PMEs have lacked coordination, limiting cross-site comparisons.
   Here, we review and synthesize approaches, challenges, and opportunities
   for conducting PMEs in forests, with the goal of guiding design
   decisions, while maximizing the potential for coordination. We reviewed
   63 forest PMEs at 70 sites world-wide. Workshops, meetings, and
   communications with experimentalists were used to generate and build
   consensus around approaches for addressing the key challenges and
   enhancing coordination. Past forest PMEs employed a variety of study
   designs related to treatment level, replication, plot and infrastructure
   characteristics, and measurement approaches. Important considerations
   for establishing new forest PMEs include: selecting appropriate
   treatment levels to reach ecological thresholds; balancing cost,
   logistical complexity, and effectiveness in infrastructure design; and
   preventing unintended water subsidies. Response variables in forest PMEs
   were organized into three broad tiers reflecting increasing complexity
   and resource intensiveness, with the first tier representing a
   recommended core set of common measurements. Differences in site
   conditions combined with unique research questions of experimentalists
   necessitate careful adaptation of guidelines for forest PMEs to balance
   local objectives with coordination among experiments. We advocate
   adoption of a common framework for coordinating forest PME design to
   enhance cross-site comparability and advance fundamental knowledge about
   the response and sensitivity of diverse forest ecosystems to
   precipitation extremes.}},

Abstract = {{The first attempts to describe species ecological niches were simple
   geometric procedures that depict the niche boundaries directly from

   for its simplicity, clear ecological rational and precise definition of
   the niche. However, it lacked the ability to differentiate areas of the
   niche with different probabilities of occurrence according to
   environmental suitability. We incorporate the Tukey depth, a
   mathematical tool to measure the centrality of a point within a cloud of
   points on a multidimensional space, in the convex hull approach to (i)
   propose a new procedure (CH-Tukey) to estimate species' environmental
   suitability, and (ii) estimate niche overlap coherently. In addition to
   a clear ecological rational and simplicity the CH-Tukey procedure has a
   number of attractive features: use of presence-only data; independence
   from background data; invariance to scale; robustness to outliers; and
   the decomposition of the niche into a finite number of iso-suitability
   levels, permitting the computation of consistent overlap indices. We
   illustrate the use of CH-Tukey, using occurrence data of the main
   Quercus species and subspecies from Western Mediterranean Europe,
   comparing its outputs with BIOCLIM and MaxEnt. Results showed distinct
   niche geometries among the different approaches. BIOCLIM produced
   rectilinear niches reflecting the assumption that ecological variables
   are independent in their action on the species. CH-Tukey, relaxing this
   assumption, adjusts niche outer boundary and the inner suitability
   levels to the known occurrences. MaxEnt produced unbounded niche
   geometries, showing abrupt shifts in the species response to the
   environmental variables. The niche predictions obtained with geometric
   approaches, BIOCLIM and CH-Tukey, are simpler but better aligned with

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We develop a novel importance sampler to compute the full likelihood
   function of a demographic or structural scenario given the site
   frequency spectrum (SFS) at a locus free of intra-locus recombination.
   This sampler, instead of representing the hidden genealogy of a sample
   of individuals by a labelled binary tree, uses the minimal level of
   information about such a tree that is needed for the likelihood of the
   SFS and thus takes advantage of the huge reduction in the size of the
   state space that needs to be integrated. We assume that the population
   may have demographically changed and may be non-panmictically
   structured, as reflected by the branch lengths and the topology of the
   genealogical tree of the sample, respectively. We also assume that
   mutations conform to the infinitely-many-sites model. We achieve this by
   a controlled Markov process that generates `particles' in the hidden
   space of SFS histories which are always compatible with the observed
   SFS.
   To produce the particles, we use Aldous' Beta-splitting model for a one
   parameter family of prior distributions over genealogical topologies or
   shapes (including that of the Kingman coalescent) and allow the branch
   lengths or epoch times to have a parametric family of priors specified
   by a model of demography (including exponential growth and bottleneck
   models). Assuming independence across unlinked loci, we can estimate the
   likelihood of a population scenario based on a large collection of
   independent SFS by an importance sampling scheme, using the
   (unconditional) distribution of the genealogies under this scenario when
   the latter is available. When it is not available, we instead compute
   the joint likelihood of the tree balance parameter beta assuming that
   the tree topology follows Aldous' Beta splitting model, and of the
   demographic scenario determining the distribution of the
   inter-coalescence times or epoch times in the genealogy of a sample, in
   order to at least distinguish different equivalence classes of
   population scenarios leading to different tree balances and epoch times.
   Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the
   approach with publicly available code. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{228}},
Pages = {{52-61}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Climate change and nitrogen (N) deposition are among the most important
   drivers of biodiversity change at a global scale. Although commonly
   considered separately in applied research, conservation, and policy
   development, both empirical evidence and modelling studies indicate that
   these two stressors may act synergistically and trigger a more
   pronounced biodiversity loss than each of them alone. Interactive
   effects thus need to be considered in biodiversity conservation. In this
   study, we propose a new method for jointly assessing risk from both
   stressors to habitats by combining climate envelope modelling and the
   evaluation of exceedance of empirical critical loads for eutrophication
   through N deposition. Based on this approach we can calculate a combined
   risk metric, which is the scaled exceedance of the N critical load and
   climatic thresholds in the three-dimensional space of N deposition,
   temperature, and water limitation. We use a habitat map to project this
   risk metric for 34 EUNIS habitat types across Austria. Resulting risk
   maps indicated that about 16 \% of the area of these natural and
   semi-natural habitat types is currently at risk from either N
   exceedance, drought or warming. Using combinations of future climatic
   (RCP2.5 and RCP8.5) and N deposition (business as usual, current
   legislation and maximum feasible reduction) scenarios, we predict that
   the area at risk might increase to up to 19\% until 2050, with risk from
   N-deposition decreasing and risk from climate change increasing.
   Combined impacts of both stressors affect only up to 2\% of the entire
   evaluated area, but are much more frequent in particular habitat types
   such as oligotrophic bogs and subalpine to alpine grasslands. We
   conclude that this method provides a useful screening procedure to
   identify and compare areas and habitats under combined risk from both
   stressors and to thus support prioritization and decision making in
   biodiversity conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The use of remote cameras is widespread in wildlife ecology, yet few
   examples exist of their utility for collecting environmental data. We
   used a novel camera trap method to evaluate the accuracy of gridded snow
   data in a mountainous region of the northeastern US. We were
   specifically interested in assessing (1) how snow depth observations
   from remote cameras compare with gridded climate data, (2) the sources
   of error associated with the gridded data and (3) the influence of
   spatial sampling on bias. We compared daily observations recorded by
   remote cameras with Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) gridded
   predictions using data from three winters (2014-2016). Snow depth
   observations were correlated with SNODAS predictions for sites (R-2 =
   0.20) and regions (R-2 = 0.16), yet we detected factors associated with
   SNODAS bias at both scales. Specifically, SNODAS underpredicted depths
   at high elevations, at sites with higher solar radiation, and within
   conifer-dominated forest. Depths were most underpredicted at highest
   elevations, up to 44 and 26 cm on average at the site and region scales,
   respectively. Bias was greatest when predictions were lowest,
   occasionally predicting snow absence when depths were >100 cm at camera
   sites. We also detected breakdowns in accuracy when certain
   environmental conditions varied within the 1 km(2) SNODAS grid cells.
   For example, underprediction was greatest when the solar radiation
   values of camera stations increased relative to the mean of the SNODAS
   grid cells. This relationship was most prominent in mountainous regions,
   suggesting that factors which influence solar radiation (e.g.
   topographic complexity) contribute to SNODAS inaccuracy. We caution
   using gridded snow data for ecological studies when bias is unknown. We
   suggest increased sampling to adjust for errors associated with gridded
   data products that arise from factors, such as forest cover and
   topographic variability. Increasing resolution and accuracy of climate
   data will improve predictions of species' responses to climate change.}},

   stopping diet choice model required fewer field parameters than optimal
   foraging models and more accurately reflected hunter catch in Southwest
   China. The optimal stopping model also indicated that hunters should be
   less selective when they experience a larger opportunity cost for their
   time. Finally, we illustrate a new method to evaluate harvest impact

Abstract = {{Climatic extremes are becoming more frequent and intense across much of
   the globe, potentially transforming the biodiversity and functioning of
   affected ecosystems. In freshwaters, hydrological extremes such as
   drought can regulate beta diversity, acting as powerful environmental
   filters to dictate the complement of species and functional traits found
   at local and landscape scales. New methods that enable beta diversity
   and its functional equivalent to be partitioned into turnover
   (replacement of species/functions) and nestedness-resultant (gain/loss
   of species/functions) components may offer novel insights into the
   parallel impacts of drought on ecosystem structure and function. Using a
   series of artificial channels (mesocosms) designed to mimic perennial
   headwater streams, we experimentally manipulated streamflows to simulate
   a gradient of drought intensity. We then modelled taxonomic and
   functional turnover and nestedness of macroinvertebrate communities
   along this gradient, validating direct gradient approaches
   (bootstrapping, Mantel tests) against null models of nestedness. Drought
   intensification produced significant environmental distance decay trends
   (i.e. communities became increasingly taxonomically and functionally
   dissimilar the more differentially disturbed by drought they were).
   Taxonomic distance decay was primarily driven by turnover, while the
   functional trend reflected a combination of richness differences and
   turnover at different points along the gradient. Taxonomic and
   functional distance decay slopes were not significantly different,
   implying that communities were functionally vulnerable to drying. The
   increased frequency and intensity of droughts predicted under most
   climate change scenarios could thus profoundly modify not only the
   structure of running water invertebrate communities, but also the
   ecosystem functions they underpin.}},

Abstract = {{Aim High-elevation plants are disproportionally affected by climate
   change. As temperatures rise, the amount of available alpine habitat in
   the Rocky Mountains will decrease resulting in potential local
   extinctions of plant species. In addition to the direct effects of
   climate-driven habitat loss, alpine plants must also respond to indirect
   effects, such as changes in disturbance regimes. One notable shift is
   the increase of wildfire frequency in regions where fire was previously
   rare or absent, including the alpine. We hypothesized that direct
   climatic changes compounded with increased wildfire frequency will
   reduce the future suitable habitat of high-elevation plants more than if
   climate was considered alone. Location Taxon Rocky Mountain Floristic
   Region, western North America. Saxifraga austromontana (Saxifragaceae),
   a wildflower endemic to high elevations of the Rocky Mountain Floristic
   Region. Methods Results Our approach integrated historical herbarium
   records, field surveys, remote sensing, species distribution models,
   historic wildfire data, and predictive models. Our results indicate
   wildfire has significantly reduced the abundance and increased the
   likelihood of extirpation for S. austromontana. Increased fire frequency
   compounded with direct climatic changes will likely reduce the range of
   the species by approximately 43\% by 2050 compared to 38\% due to
   climate alone, under a moderate CO2 emissions scenario. The influence of
   wildfire varies regionally. For instance, the Middle Rockies will likely
   lose 74\% of its suitable habitat of which 16\% may be lost due to fire,
   while other regions, such as the northern range, will be less negatively
   affected by direct and indirect effects. Main Conclusions Our evidence
   that increased wildfire frequency will compound the impacts of climate
   change on alpine taxa in North America led to the development of a new,

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic alteration of fire regimes is implicated in the extinction
   or decline of species across the globe. Active management of fire
   regimes using specified guidelines can help sustain diversity and
   counter this loss. However, some species occur across multiple
   communities with differing fireregime requirements or may exploit the
   dynamics of associated ecotones. These complexities are not easily
   understood via a simple consideration of lifehistory traits or
   unravelled by a simple experimental framework. Population modelling,
   however, may provide valuable insights in these instances, but to date
   this remains unexplored. A population model based on detailed
   demographic, habitat and fireregime data was developed for the species
   Prostanthera askania. The species occurs across rainforest/eucalypt
   forest ecotones subject to long-term alteration, fragmentation and
   invasion by exotic species. Modelling revealed that current recommended
   fire guidelines will not sustain this species under these novel
   conditions. Fire regimes that minimised extinction risk in some
   scenarios had double or five times the fire frequencies of recommended
   regimes. Managing fire was also more important in specific habitat
   (gully habitat rather than on slopes or ridges). Currently applied
   management actions for Prostanthera askania do not include any fire
   management and the regimes that apply to most habitat in which the
   species occurs (no fire or fire at up to 50-year intervals in gully
   habitat) is not optimal for the species. Management will be
   substantially more effective if specific fire treatments revealed by
   this study are employed (e.g. fire intervals of 20-30years in gully
   habitat). The study demonstrates that a conceptualisation and
   consideration of communities as both temporally and spatially dynamic
   can substantially contribute to better fire management outcomes. The
   approach used herein can be readily adapted and applied to a plethora of
   species via a range of software packages and codes.}},

   many cases microsatellite loci may be sufficient for describing major

Abstract = {{Aim The ability of tree species to track their climatic niche at rates
   comparable to global warming is of concern, particularly if they are
   constrained by local adaptation. If a species is locally adapted at its
   range margin, it could be beneficial for range expansion because it
   ensures that the genotypes colonizing new areas are the fittest, given
   that environmental conditions are more similar to the current ones. In
   trees, local adaptation can slow range expansion when climate change
   happens much faster than their ability to migrate. Location Time period

   investigate experimentally a series of factors thought to constrain the
   seedling phase at the leading edge of the distribution of a dominant
   tree species, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall.). We established a
   seed transplant experiment using six provenances, representing the
   latitudinal species range, and transplanted them to 12 sites within, at
   and beyond the current northern species range margin. Results Main
   conclusions At present, northern provenances provide the best
   opportunity for establishment beyond the current range, where climatic
   conditions are more similar than those of the warmer central or southern
   portions of the species range. Establishment was highest within the
   species range, but survival rates were comparable to those at the range
   margin and beyond, regardless of provenance. We also found that the
   local climate was the most influential factor for early seedling
   establishment and survival; however, a lack of suitable microsites also
   significantly constrained recruitment. Our study highlights the complex
   interaction between provenance, climate and microsite conditions that is
   required to ensure successful seedling recruitment. Although sugar maple
   is currently displaying evidence for local adaptation to facilitate
   range shifts, it could risk maladaptation in the future if the local
   climate warms beyond a threshold required to ensure seed germination and
   a lack of favourable microsite conditions beyond the range.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire disturbance is one of the most prevalent forces of ecological
   change in freshwater environments. Studies of stream temperature
   responses to wildfire disturbance are often limited to individual
   watersheds or burn events, resulting in an incomplete understanding of:
   1) how wildfires affect stream temperature at broader spatial scales and
   2) which environmental and pyrological factors are important predictors
   of thermal responses. We analyzed long-term temperature monitoring data
   from 18 fire-affected streams across the Pacific Northwest We used a
   nonparametric effect-size approach to quantify response patterns among
   26 metrics describing the thermal regime (magnitude, variability,
   frequency, and timing of thermal events) in the 1st postfire year. We
   used multivariate ordination and spatially explicit data on pyrological,
   hydrological, and meteorological conditions to identify potential
   drivers of thermal sensitivity to wildfire effects in disturbed
   watersheds. Thermal responses were highly variable at the site level,
   but, in general, streams of the Pacific Northwest are prone to increased
   frequency of warmer temperatures and decreased frequency of cooler
   temperatures in the year after a wildfire. Redundancy analysis showed
   that 30 to 55\% of the variation in stream temperature responses was
   equally explained by pyrological, hydrological, and meteorological
   conditions. Mean annual precipitation, \% watershed burned, and mean
   annual flow were primary factors shaping thermal response to wildfire,
   but the relative importance of these potential drivers varied among
   aspects of the thermal regime. Our study provides new insight into the
   regional influence of wildfire on stream thermal regimes and indicates
   that wildfire could exacerbate climate-induced warming in streams.
   Further investigation of the interactions among wildfire, hydrology, and
   climatic processes and enhanced stream network monitoring are needed to
   manage fresh waters in a future characterized by more severe and

Abstract = {{Climate change reshapes the physiology and development of organisms
   through phenotypic plasticity, epigenetic modifications, and genetic
   adaptation. Under evolutionary pressures of the sessile lifestyle,
   plants possess efficient systems of phenotypic plasticity and
   acclimation to environmental conditions. Molecular analysis, especially
   through omics approaches, of these primary lines of environmental
   adjustment in the context of climate change has revealed the underlying
   biochemical and physiological mechanisms, thus characterizing the links
   between phenotypic plasticity and climate change responses. The
   efficiency of adaptive plasticity under climate change indeed depends on
   the realization of such biochemical and physiological mechanisms, but
   the importance of sensing and signaling mechanisms that can integrate
   perception of environmental cues and transduction into physiological
   responses is often overlooked. Recent progress opens the possibility of
   considering plant phenotypic plasticity and responses to climate change
   through the perspective of environmental sensing and signaling. This
   review aims to analyze present knowledge on plant sensing and signaling
   mechanisms and discuss how their structural and functional
   characteristics lead to resilience or hypersensitivity under conditions
   of climate change. Plant cells are endowed with arrays of environmental
   and stress sensors and with internal signals that act as molecular
   integrators of the multiple constraints of climate change, thus giving
   rise to potential mechanisms of climate change sensing. Moreover,
   mechanisms of stress-related information propagation lead to stress
   memory and acquired stress tolerance that could withstand different
   scenarios of modifications of stress frequency and intensity. However,

Abstract = {{Identifying priority areas for biodiversity conservation is particularly
   challenging in the marine environment due to the open and dynamic nature
   of the ocean, the paucity of information on species distribution, and
   the necessary balance between marine biodiversity conservation and
   essential supporting services such as seafood provision. We used the
   Patagonian seabird breeding community as a case study to propose an
   integrated and adaptive method for delimiting key marine areas for
   conservation. Priority areas were defined through a free
   decision-support tool (Marxan) that included projected at-sea
   distributions of seabirds (approximately 2,225,000 individuals of 14
   species); BirdLife Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) for
   pelagic bird species; and the economic costs of potential regulations in
   fishing practices. The proposed reserve network encompassed
   approximately 300,000 km(2) that was largely concentrated in northern
   and southern inshore and northern and central offshore regions. This
   reserve network exceeded the minimum threshold of 20\% conservation of
   the abundance of each species proposed by the World Parks Congress.
   Based on marine currents in the study area, we further identified the 3
   primary water masses that may influence areas of conservation priority
   through water inflow. Our reserve network may benefit from enhanced
   marine productivity in these highly connected areas, but they may be
   threatened by human impacts such as marine pollution. Our method of
   reserve network design is an important advance with respect to the more
   classical approaches based on criteria defined for one or a few species
   and may be particularly useful when information on spatial patterns is
   data deficient. Our approach also accommodates addition of new
   information on seabird distribution and population dynamics, human
   activities, and alterations in the marine environment.}},

Abstract = {{Questions Relationships between species, their functional traits and
   environmental gradients can now be more fully understood with
   trait-based multi-species distribution models (trait-SDMs). However,
   general patterns are yet to emerge from founding studies using these
   models, which are mostly case studies at a single scale. Here, we
   address the generality of trait-environment relations by asking whether
   these relationships hold for different sampling schemes, environmental
   variables and species sets. Methods We focus on the drought and
   fire-resistant ``mallee{''} eucalypts of a semi-arid region of southeast
   Australia, which are likely to face new climates and disturbance regimes
   under global change. We use hierarchical regression modelling to test
   how trait-environment relationships change for two data sets
   representing an extensively collected, multipurpose data set and an
   intensively collected data set stratified along environmental gradients.
   Results Three functional traits (specific leaf area, maximum height and
   seed mass) explained a substantial portion of the occurrence of species
   along soil, water and climatic gradients, with the relationship between
   seed mass and soil type robust across all tests. Other trait-environment
   relationships changed depending on study design and species set, with
   soil and substrate variables more important relative to climate
   (precipitation) for the intensively sampled survey. Remotely sensed
   variables were good surrogates for some field-based measures (soil
   type), but not others (land form: dune or swale). In particular,
   airborne soil radiometric data show promise as a spatially continuous
   substitute for soil texture. Conclusions Trait-SDMs are a powerful tool
   for quantifying ecological interactions, but generalizations will only
   be possible when sample design, scale and environmental variables are
   carefully considered. We show that important ecological relationships
   can be diluted or missed entirely in broad scale trait-environment
   studies that rely on remotely sensed climate variables alone.
   Relationships that are robust to differences in study design, growth
   form and ecosystem (e.g., heavier seeds on sandy soil) are the most
   likely to reveal general ecological processes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new approach of change detection that reduces
   seasonality in time series by using Photosynthetic Vegetation Time
   Series (PVTS) from satellite images. With this approach, each pixel
   value represents at the subpixel level a fraction of the photosynthetic
   forest's activity. Our hypothesis is based on an assumption that
   photosynthetic vegetation fractions will remain constant until a
   disturbing agent (natural or anthropic) occurs. Using Landsat data, we
   compared our approach with the Carnegie Landsat Systems Analysis-Lite
   (CLASlite) approach and with the national reports of the Ministry of the
   Environment of Peru (MINAM). After reducing seasonal variations in
   Landsat data, we detected deforestation events with a new detection
   method. Our approach (which was called PVts-beta) of detection is a
   simple method that does not model the seasonality and it only requires
   as inputs: i) the average and standard deviation of the time series of a
   pixel and ii) a threshold magnitude (beta) that was calibrated to detect
   deforestation events in tropical forests. For the PVts-beta approach,
   the results of calibration show that deforestation was optimally
   detected for beta = (5,6), higher or lower than this range, the biases
   favor to false detections and favor the omission of deforestation too.
   On the other hand, the overall accuracy for the PVts-beta approach was
   91.1\%, with an omission and commission of 8.3\% and 0.5\% respectively,
   while for CLASlite the overall accuracy was 79.2\%, with an omission and
   commission of 20.8\% and 0.0\% respectively. The differences in the
   overall accuracy between the PVts-beta and CLASlite approach were
   significant, being atmospheric noise a main problem which CLASlite
   usually does not work optimally. The strength of our PVts-beta approach
   is the early detection at the subpixel level of deforestation events
   that, added to our new method of change detection explain the little
   omission obtained in the results. Therefore, the PVts-beta approach-that
   we propose here- provides the opportunity to monitoring deforestation
   events in tropical forests at sub-annual scales using Landsat data, and
   it can be used for near-real-time change detection monitoring without a
   doubt.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical descriptions of reconstructed fire regimes are often
   extrapolated from a composite of small forest stands to represent
   extensive geographical areas. However, statistical properties of fire
   regimes are scale-dependent, thus causing some extrapolations from fine
   scale to coarse scale and comparisons between fire-scar-based
   reconstructions to be inappropriate. We assessed landscape fire regimes
   of the Sacramento Mountains, in southern New Mexico, using
   dendrochronological methods and a variety of fire statistics and
   analysis filters. We reconstructed historical and recent fire regimes
   for the Mescalero Apache Tribal Lands (MATL) at tree and site scale (25
   ha). We then estimated the Sacramento Mountains historical and recent
   fire regimes by combining paleo fire data from this study with published
   data from the adjacent Lincoln National Forest (LNF). We applied filters
   to provide fire statistics that are relatively unbiased to the different
   spatial measurement extent of the studies. This is the first study to
   assess fire regime in the MATL over multiple spatial and temporal
   scales. The results show that frequent surface fires occurred at all
   scales in the Sacramento Mountains until fire was excluded from the
   landscape in the early 1900s. Historical fires were found to be
   synchronous with drought years, typically La Nina events, and often
   preceded by wet years. We did not find evidence supporting differences
   in fire regimes between the MATL and the LNF, suggesting that fire
   cessation following intensive Euro-American settlement was widespread.
   The interruption of frequent surface fires, together with other changes
   in forest structure and climate, pose a significant threat to

Abstract = {{Conodont fossils are highly valuable for Paleozoic biostratigraphy and
   for interpreting evolutionary change, but identifying and describing
   conodont morphologies, and characterizing gradual shape variation remain
   challenging. We used geometric morphometric (GM) analysis to conduct the
   first landmark-based morphometric analysis of the biostratigraphically
   useful conodont genus Neognathodus. Our objective is to assess whether
   previously defined morphotype groups are reliably distinct from one
   another. As such, we reevaluate patterns of morphologic change in
   Neognathodus P1elements, perform maximum-likelihood tests of
   evolutionary modes, and construct novel, GM-based biozonations through a
   Desmoinesian (Middle Pennsylvanian) section in the Illinois Basin. Our
   GM results record the entire spectrum of shape variability among
   Neognathodus morphotypes, thus alleviating the problem of documenting
   and classifying gradual morphologic transitions between morphotypes.
   Statistically distinct GM groups support previously established
   classifications of N. bassleri, N. bothrops, and N. roundyi.
   Statistically indistinct pairs of GM groups do not support literature
   designations of N. medadultimus and N. medexultimus, and N. dilatus and
   N. metanodosus, and we synonymize each pair. Maximum-likelihood tests of
   evolutionary modes provide the first statistical assessment of
   Neognathodus evolutionary models in the Desmoinesian. The most likely
   evolutionary models are an unbiased random walk or a general random
   walk. We name four distinct biozones through the Desmoinesian using GM
   results, and these align with previous biozonation structure based on
   the Neognathodus Index (NI), illustrating that Neognathodus-based
   biostratigraphic correlations would not change between GM or NI methods.
   The structural similarity between both biozonations showcases that
   determining GM-based biozones is not redundant, as this comparison
   validates using landmark-based GM work to construct viable biozonations
   for subsequent stratigraphic correlations. Although this study is
   limited to the Illinois Basin, our quantitative methodology can be
   applied broadly to test taxonomic designations of additional genera,
   interpret statistically robust evolutionary patterns, and construct
   valid biozones for this significant chordate group.}},

Abstract = {{Resource limitations often prevent the active management required to
   maintain habitat quality in protected areas. Because restrictions in
   access or allowable public activities are the sole conservation measure
   in these locations, an important question to consider is whether species
   of conservation concern truly benefit from parcels that are shielded
   from human disturbance. Here, we assess the conservation benefit of
   protecting birds from human recreation on over 204 km of sandy beaches
   by (a) estimating the total area of beach-nesting bird habitat that has
   been created by conservation protections; (b) quantifying the change in
   nesting habitat extent should further conservation protections be
   implemented; and (c) providing data to inform future protected area
   expansion. We use a maximum entropy species distribution modeling
   approach to estimate the extent and quality of suitable habitat for four
   beach-nesting bird species of conservation concern under the existing
   management regime and compare it to scenarios in which the entire study
   area is either unprotected of fully protected from human disturbance.
   Managing humans has dramatic conservation returns for least terns and
   piping plovers, creating extensive nesting habitat that otherwise would
   not exist. There is considerable scope for conservation gains,
   potentially tripling the extent of nesting areas. Expanding conservation
   footprints for American oystercatchers and black skimmers is predicted
   to enhance the quality of existing nesting areas. The work demonstrates
   the utility of modeling changes in habitat suitability to inform

Abstract = {{A critical consideration when using molecular ecological methods to
   detect trends and parameterize models at very fine spatial and temporal

   features, including most anthropogenic modifications, can cause
   biologically important, but very recent changes in gene flow that
   require substantial statistical power to detect. The problem is one of
   temporal scale: Human change is rapid and recent, while genetic changes
   accumulate slowly. We generated SNPs from thousands of nuclear loci to
   characterize the population structure of New York-endangered eastern
   tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) on Long Island and quantify the
   impacts of roads on population fragmentation. In stark contrast to a
   recent microsatellite study, we uncovered highly structured populations
   over an extremely small spatial scale (approximately 40 km(2)) in an
   increasingly human-modified landscape. Geographic distance and the
   presence of roads between ponds were both strong predictors of genetic
   divergence, suggesting that both natural and anthropogenic factors
   contribute to the observed patterns of genetic variation. All ponds
   supported small to modest effective breeding populations, and pond
   surface area showed a strong positive correlation with population size.
   None of these patterns emerged in an earlier study of the same system

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Timely detection of ecological regime shifts is a key problem for
   ecosystem managers, because changed ecosystem dynamics and function will
   usually necessitate a change in management strategies. However,
   currently available methods for detecting regime shifts depend on having
   multiple long time series data from both before and after the regime
   shift. This data requirement is prohibitive for many ecosystems. Here,
   we present a new approach for detecting regime shifts from
   one-dimensional spatial (transect) data from just a single time step
   either side of the transition. Characteristic length scale (CLS)
   estimation is a method of attractor reconstruction combined with
   nonlinear prediction that enables identification of the emergent scale
   at which deterministic behavior of the system is best observed.
   Importantly, previous studies show that a fundamental change in
   ecosystem dynamics, from one domain of attraction to another, is
   reflected in a change in the CLS, i.e., the approach enables
   distinguishing regime shifts from variability in dynamics around a
   single attractor. Until now the method required highly resolved
   two-dimensional spatial data, but here we adapted the approach so that
   the CLS can be estimated from one-dimensional transect data. We
   demonstrate its successful application to both model and real ecosystem
   data. In our model test cases, we detected change in the CLS in cases
   where the shape (topology) of the interaction network had changed,
   leading to a shift in community composition. In an examination of
   benthic transect data from four Indonesian coral reefs, changes in the
   CLS for two of the reefs indicate a regime shift. This new development
   in estimating CLSs makes it possible to detect regime shifts in systems
   where data are limited, removing ambiguity in the interpretation of
   community change.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal variability in the environment drives variation in vital rates,
   with consequences for population dynamics and life-history evolution.
   Integral projection models (IPMs) are data-driven structured population
   models widely used to study population dynamics and life-history
   evolution in temporally variable environments. However, many datasets
   have insufficient temporal replication for the environmental drivers of
   vital rates to be identified with confidence, limiting their use for
   evaluating population level responses to environmental change. Parameter
   selection, where the kernel is constructed at each time step by randomly
   selecting the time-varying parameters from their joint probability
   distribution, is one approach to including stochasticity in IPMs. We
   consider a factor analytic (FA) approach for modelling the covariance
   matrix of time-varying parameters, whereby latent variable(s) describe
   the covariance among vital rate parameters. This decreases the number of
   parameters to estimate and, where the covariance is positive, the latent
   variable can be interpreted as a measure of environmental quality. We
   demonstrate this using simulation studies and two case studies. The
   simulation studies suggest the FA approach provides similarly accurate
   estimates of stochastic population growth rate to estimating an
   unstructured covariance matrix. We demonstrate how the latent parameter
   can be perturbed to show how selection on reproductive delays in the
   monocarp Carduus nutans changes under different environmental
   conditions. We develop a demographic model of the fire dependent herb
   Eryngium cuneifolium to show how a putative driver of the variation in
   environmental quality can be incorporated with the addition of a single
   parameter. Using perturbation analyses we determine optimal management
   strategies for this species. This approach estimates fewer parameters
   than previous approaches and allows novel eco-evolutionary insights.
   Predictions on population dynamics and life-history evolution under
   different environmental conditions can be made without necessarily
   identifying causal factors. Putative environmental drivers can be
   incorporated with relatively few parameters, allowing for predictions on
   how populations will respond to changes in the environment.}},

   classification approach}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{227}},
Pages = {{9-18}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Determining whether species have gone extinct requires considering the
   timing and reliability of records, the timing and adequacy of surveys,
   and the timing, extent and intensity of threats. However, previous
   assessments have either applied qualitative approaches or considered
   only the first of these factors. We applied quantitative methods
   encompassing all three factors to a suite of 61 potentially or confirmed
   extinct species of birds. We tested six different methods, each with a
   range of thresholds, for assigning species to IUCN Red List Categories,
   and compared the results with species' current categories. We recommend
   that if both the probability that a species remains extant based on
   threats and the probability based on records and surveys fall below 0.5,
   it should qualify as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct), while if
   both probabilities fall below 0.1 it should qualify as Extinct. This
   novel approach resulted in an 80\% match with the current IUCN Red List
   classification of species. The exceptions largely reflect species whose
   reclassification was pending the outcome of this work. Consequently, we
   recommend that nine species are reclassified on the IUCN Red List, with
   cryptic treehunter (Cichlocolaptes mazarbarnetti), Alagoas
   foliage-gleaner (Philydor novaesi) poo-uli (Melamprosops phaeosoma) now
   qualifying as Extinct. We estimate a revised total of 187 extinctions
   since 1500, of which 90\% have been of insular species. The major
   drivers were invasive alien species (46\%) and hunting/trapping (26\%).
   Application of this approach in non-avian groups would increase the
   robustness of extinction rate estimates and species' classifications on
   the IUCN Red List.}},

Abstract = {{Otolith growth-increment chronologies provide an approach for evaluating
   the impacts of both high-frequency (e.g., interannual) and low-frequency
   (e.g., interdecadal) climate variability on fish growth. A
   growth-increment biochronology spanning six decades, spanning several
   warm and cold climate regime periods, was developed for a commercially
   important species of rockfish, Sebastes polyspinis, in the Gulf of
   Alaska. To confirm that all increments were correctly identified and
   placed in time, we borrowed the technique of crossdating from the
   tree-ring science of dendrochronology, which ensured high data quality.
   We then used a mixed effects model to partition variance in otolith
   growth-increment width among intrinsic (e.g., age-related) and extrinsic
   (e.g., climate-related) factors. This biochronology was contrasted with
   one recently developed for S. alutus, a closely-related species which
   exhibited a significant change in growth following the late 1970s North
   Pacific climate regime shift. Both species generally showed positive
   relationships between warm climate conditions and growth, though S.
   polyspinis experienced a relatively smaller step-increase in growth
   following the regime shift. The new S. polyspinis otolith biochronology
   represents a long-term record of growth that extends well before
   biological specimens were first collected in the Gulf of Alaska,
   providing a potential tool for fisheries managers to evaluate the
   effects of climate variability on growth and biological reference

Abstract = {{Tree-ring carbon and oxygen isotope ratios have been used to understand
   past dynamics in forest carbon and water cycling. Recently, this has
   been possible for different parts of single growing seasons by isolating
   anatomical sections within individual annual rings. Uncertainties in
   this approach are associated with correlated climate legacies that can
   occur at a higher frequency, such as across successive seasons, or a
   lower frequency, such as across years. The objective of this study was
   to gain insight into how legacies affect cross-correlation in the C-13
   and O-18 isotope ratios in the earlywood (EW) and latewood (LW)
   fractions of Pinus ponderosa trees at thirteen sites across a
   latitudinal gradient influenced by the North American Monsoon (NAM)
   climate system. We observed that C-13 from EW and LW has significant
   positive cross-correlations at most sites, whereas EW and LW O-18 values
   were cross-correlated at about half the sites. Using combined
   statistical and mechanistic models, we show that cross-correlations in
   both C-13 and O-18 can be largely explained by a low-frequency
   (multiple-year) mode that may be associated with long-term climate
   change. We isolated, and statistically removed, the low-frequency
   correlation, which resulted in greater geographical differentiation of
   the EW and LW isotope signals. The remaining higher-frequency (seasonal)
   cross-correlations between EW and LW isotope ratios were explored using
   a mechanistic isotope fractionation-climate model. This showed that
   lower atmospheric vapor pressure deficits associated with monsoon rain
   increase the EW-LW differentiation for both C-13 and O-18 at southern
   sites, compared to northern sites. Our results support the hypothesis
   that dominantly unimodal precipitation regimes, such as near the
   northern boundary of the NAM, are more likely to foster
   cross-correlations in the isotope signals of EW and LW, potentially due
   to greater sharing of common carbohydrate and soil water resource pools,
   compared to southerly sites with bimodal precipitation regimes.}},

Abstract = {{American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was once an important component
   forests in the central Appalachians (USA), but it was functionally
   extirpated nearly a century ago. Attempts are underway to reintroduce
   blight-resistant chestnut to its former range, but it is uncertain how
   current forest composition, climate, and atmospheric changes and
   disturbance regimes will interact to determine future forest dynamics
   and ecosystem services. The combination of novel environmental
   conditions (e.g. climate change), a reintroduced tree species and new
   disturbance regimes (e.g. exotic insect pests, fire suppression) have no
   analog in the past that can be used to parameterize phenomenological
   models. We therefore used a mechanistic approach within the LANDIS-II
   forest landscape model that relies on physiological first principles to
   project forest dynamics as the outcome of competition of tree cohorts
   for light and water as a function of temperature, precipitation, CO2
   concentration, and life history traits. We conducted a factorial
   landscape simulation experiment to evaluate specific hypotheses about
   future forest dynamics in two study sites in the center of the former
   range of chestnut. Our results supported the hypotheses that climate
   change would favor chestnut because of its optimal temperature range and
   relative drought resistance, and that chestnut would be less competitive
   in the more mesic Appalachian Plateau province because competitors will
   be less stressed. The hypothesis that chestnut will increase carbon
   stocks was supported, although the increase was modest. Our results
   confirm that aggressive restoration is needed regardless of climate and
   soils, and that increased aggressiveness of chestnut restoration
   increased biomass accumulation. The hypothesis that chestnut restoration
   will increase both compositional and structural richness was not
   supported because chestnut displaced some species and age cohorts.
   Although chestnut restoration did not markedly enhance carbon stocks,
   our findings provide hope that this formerly important species can be
   successfully reintroduced and associated ecosystem services recovered.}},

   elsewhere: A case study using functional connectivity modelling of the
   African elephant}},

Abstract = {{1. Fencing is one of the most common methods of mitigating
   human-wildlife conflicts. At the same time, fencing is considered one of
   the most pressing threats emerging in conservation globally. Although
   fences act as barriers and can cause population isolation and
   fragmentation over time, it is difficult to quantitatively predict the
   consequences fences have for wildlife.
   2. Here, we model how fencing designed to mitigate human-elephant
   conflict (HEC) on the Borderlands between Kenya and Tanzania will affect
   functional connectivity and movement corridors for African elephants.
   Specifically, we (a) model functional landscape connectivity integrating
   natural and anthropogenic factors; (b) predict seasonal movement
   corridors used by elephants in non-protected areas; and (c) evaluate
   whether fencing in one area can potentially intensify human-wildlife
   conflicts elsewhere.
   3. We used GPS movement and remote sensing data to develop monthly
   step-selection functions to model functional connectivity. For future
   scenarios, we used an ongoing fencing project designed for HEC
   mitigation within the study area. We modelled movement corridors using
   least-cost path and circuit theory methods, evaluated their predictive
   power and quantified connectivity changes resulting from the planned
   fencing.
   4. Our results suggest that fencing will not cause landscape
   fragmentation and will not change functional landscape connectivity
   dramatically. However, fencing will lead to a loss of connectivity
   locally and will increase the potential for HEC in new areas. We
   estimate that wetlands, important for movement corridors, will be more
   intensively used by the elephants, which may also cause problems of
   overgrazing. Seasonal analysis highlights an increasing usage of
   non-protected lands in the dry season and equal importance of the pinch
   point wetlands for preserving overall function connectivity.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Fencing is a solution to small-scale
   human-elephant conflict problems but will not solve the issue at a
   broader scale. Moreover, our results highlight that it may intensify the
   conflicts and overuse of habitat patches in other areas, thereby
   negating conservation benefits. If fencing is employed on a broader
   scale, then it is imperative that corridors are integrated within
   protected area networks to ensure local connectivity of affected
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Current sustainability challenges - including biodiversity loss,
   pollution and land-use change require new ways of understanding, acting
   in and caring for the landscapes we live in. The concept of stewardship
   is increasingly used in research, policy and practice to articulate and
   describe responses to these challenges. However, there are multiple
   meanings and framings of stewardship across this wide user base that
   reflect different disciplinary purposes, assumptions and expertise, as
   well as a long history of use in both academic and lay contexts.
   Stewardship may therefore be considered a `boundary object'; that is, a
   conceptual tool that enables collaboration and dialogue between
   different actors whilst allowing for differences in use and perception.
   This paper seeks to map out the multiple meanings of stewardship in the
   literature and help researchers and practitioners to navigate the
   challenges and opportunities that come with using the term. We provide
   the first qualitative systematic review of stewardship, and identify
   four distinct meanings of the concept in the literature: Ethic,
   Motivation, Action and Outcome. We then develop a novel framework for
   thinking through and connecting these multiple meanings, centered around
   three dimensions: care, knowledge and agency. This framework is used to
   identify the care dimension and relational approaches as important areas
   for future stewardship research. In these efforts - and for scholars
   engaging with the stewardship concept more broadly - this paper can act
   as a helpful `centering device', connecting practitioners, policy-makers
   and researchers from multiple disciplines in pursuit of sustainability.}},

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},

Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{63-71}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from satellite imagery is one
   of the most practical ways to consistently monitor urban thermal
   environment. Given the heterogeneous nature of urban landscape, an
   implicit assumption should be considered in remotely sensed LST
   determinations that a mixed urban land cover aggregation is the
   combination of its constituent components. Currently, the common LST
   retrieval method which utilize emissivity measures estimated by NDVI
   threshold method (NDVITHM), including mono window (MW), single channel
   (SC), and split window algorithms (SW), does not take into account
   heterogeneity of pixels. While in this study, a new approach, the
   mixture analysis of emissivity (MAoE), is proposed to calculate
   temperature by estimating pixel emissivity from mixed land cover
   classes. We conduct a comparison of six approaches by the combinations
   of three LST retrieval algorithms with NDVITHM and MAoE respectively.
   The differences among strategies are characterized and analyzed by
   comparing LST estimates from Landsat 8 thermal images. The LST gradients
   derived from transect analysis are found consistently similar for
   combinations of two LST algorithms (MW and SC) and the two emissivity
   estimation algorithms (MAoE and NDVITHM). LSTs derived from SW
   algorithms using band 10 have the highest mean values, while the SC
   algorithms have moderate mean values and the MW algorithms have the
   lowest values. Standard deviations of estimated LST from MAoE are
   smaller compared with NDVITHM methods, SC retrieval algorithm with MAoE
   has the smallest standard deviation, and NDVITHM temperature estimation
   could be more impacted by different land use land cover types.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe Arctic is experiencing rapid reductions in sea ice and in
   some areas tidal glaciers are melting and retracting onto land. These
   changes are occurring at extremely rapid rates in the Northeast Atlantic
   Arctic. The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of these
   environmental changes on space use by white whales (Delphinapterus
   leucas) in Svalbard, Norway. Using a unique biotelemetry data set
   involving 34 animals, spanning two decades, habitat use and movement
   patterns were compared before (1995-2001) and after (2013-2016) a
   dramatic change in the regional sea ice regime that began in
   2006.ResultsWhite whales were extremely coastal in both study periods,
   remaining near the islands within the Svalbard Archipelago, even when
   winter sea ice formation pushed them offshore somewhat (later in the
   year in the recent period), into areas with drifting sea ice
   (concentrations up to 90\%). In both periods, the whales followed the
   same basic patterns seasonally; they occupied the west coast in summer
   and shifted to the east coast as winter approached. However, space use
   did change between the two periods, with the whales spending less time
   close to tidal glacier fronts in the second period compared to the first
   (2(nd)-36\% vs 1(st)-51\%), a habitat characterized by low swimming
   speeds and high turning angles, and more time out in the fjords
   (2(nd)-26\% vs1(st)-10\%). Use of coastal transit corridors remained the
   same in both periods; the whales appear to minimize time spent moving
   between fjords.ConclusionsGlacier fronts have previously been shown to
   be important foraging areas for white whales in Svalbard and the
   movement metrics documented in this study confirms that this is still
   the case. However, use of the Fjords habitat in summer and fall
   (frequency of occupancy and movement metrics) seen in the recent period
   suggests that the white whales might now also be feeding on Atlantic
   prey that is increasingly common in the fjords, concomitant with
   influxes of Atlantic Water along the west coast of Svalbard. Such
   behavioural flexibility, if confirmed by further diet studies, would
   likely be important for white whales in adapting to new conditions in
   Svalbard.}},

Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Over the past two decades, the use of camera traps and acoustic
   monitoring in the investigation of animal ecology have grown rapidly,
   with each technique enhancing broad-scale wildlife surveying. Camera
   traps are a cost-effective, noninvasive means of sampling communities of
   mid-to large-terrestrial species, and acoustic recording devices capture
   human sounds and sound-producing animals, including species of mammals,
   birds, anurans, and insects. Rarely are these techniques combined,
   despite the advantages of merging their respective strengths. Namely,
   camera traps paired with acoustic recorders can evaluate the abundance,
   distribution, and behavior of multiple guilds and trophic levels across
   landscapes while concurrently monitoring multiple human stressors in
   real time. Moreover, integrating these approaches enhances detection
   accuracy and strengthens statistical inference at multiple survey
   scales. We conducted a literature review, and found only 13 studies that
   combine camera traps and acoustic recorders, 8 of which either compared
   the ability of each technique to detect species of interest or discussed
   the advantages of each technique. We outline potential questions that
   can be addressed by pairing acoustic recorders and camera traps,
   including enabling the simultaneous assessment of noise pollution and
   its impacts on mammal and avian communities. Furthermore, we discuss how
   the analysis of data from each technique face similar challenges; thus,
   simultaneous innovation offers the ability to apply solutions to both
   techniques and amplify their respective strengths. Digital technologies
   and big data are changing nature conservation in increasingly profound
   ways and integration of camera traps and acoustic recorders will
   facilitate new, transformative discoveries to meet modern conservation

Abstract = {{The main goal of the study was to determine new metagenomic indicators
   demonstrating sensitivity to soil fatigue as an effect of long-term
   agricultural use as well as new metagenomic indicators demonstrating
   bacterial resistance to human agricultural activity. Thirty-one soil
   samples (agriculturally exploited soil and wastelands serving as
   controls) were taken for the study, in the south-eastern part of Poland.
   For determination of biodiversity, next generation sequencing of the 16S
   rRNA metagenomic amplicons were used with the Ion Torrent (TM)
   technology. Bacterial sequences were clustered into operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs) based on a 99\% similarity threshold. The
   correlation matrix was constructed to assess the relationships between
   bacterial families and genera and the environmental data.
   In the studied soils, 118 families and 305 genera were identified. Among
   them, 10 families were recommended as sensitive indicators of soil
   fatigue: Sphingomonadaceae > Chitinop hagaceae > Flavobacteriaceae >
   Oxtdobacteraceae > Acetobacteraceae > Myxococcaceae > Comamonadaceae >
   Pseudomonadaceae > Burkholderiaceae > Rhodanobacteraceae. Analogically,
   8 bacterial genera sensitive to agricultural practices were found:
   Pelomonas > Ramhbacter > Flavobacterium > Rhizobacter > Steroidobacter >
   Cellvibrio > Halhangium > Pseudomonas. Their sensitivity was confirmed
   by a decrease in the number of OTUs in the agricultural soils, in
   comparison to the wastelands. In contrast, 5 bacterial genera that
   should be considered as indicators of resistance to agricultural land
   use were proposed: Nitrosospira > Rhodanobacter > Aquicella >
   Burkholderia > Mucilaginibacter. Statistical tests demonstrated that the
   most important factors for the abundances of bacterial families and
   genera included soil acidity (pH), easily degradable carbon (EDC), total
   carbon (TC), nitrite nitrogen (N-NO2), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca)

   Pinus banksiana was present across the region when conditions were cool
   and dry 14,000-12,000 calibrated C-14 years before present (ybp). Pinus
   strobus became regionally dominant as temperatures increased between
   12,000 and 10,000 ybp. The composition of forests in inland and coastal
   areas diverged in response to further warming after 10,000 ybp, when
   Quercus and Pinus rigida expanded across southern New England, whereas
   conditions remained cool enough in inland areas to maintain Pinus
   strobus. Increasing precipitation allowed Tsuga canadensis, Fagus
   grandifolia, and Betula to replace Pinus strobus in inland areas during
   9,000-8,000 ybp, and also led to the expansion of Carya across the
   coastal part of the region beginning at 7,000-6,000 ybp. Abrupt cooling
   at 5,500-5,000 ybp caused sharp declines in Tsuga in inland areas and
   Quercus at some coastal sites, and the populations of those taxa
   remained low until they recovered around 3,000 ybp in response to rising
   precipitation. Throughout most of the Holocene, sites underlain by sandy
   glacial deposits were occupied by Pinus rigida and Quercus.
   Main conclusions Postglacial changes in the composition and spatial
   pattern of New England forests were controlled by long-term trends and
   abrupt shifts in temperature and precipitation, as well as by the
   environmental gradient between coastal and inland parts of the region.

Abstract = {{Questions: Sustaining ecosystem services for society in the face of
   global change is a major challenge. Resilience, an ecosystem's ability
   to absorb disturbance and return to its initial functioning, is critical
   for this. We assessed the resilience of mown subalpine grasslands
   following restoration management. Using a novel multi-indicator
   approach, we asked how different taxonomic and functional facets of
   biodiversity influence resilience mechanisms. We demonstrated this
   approach for a case study in subalpine grasslands, asking: how resilient
   are grasslands dominated by Patzkea paniculata and their agronomic
   services to changing mowing regimes?
   Location: Villar d'Arene, Hautes-Alpes, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur,
   France. Boundary area of Ecrins National Park.
   Methods: A manipulative experiment tested the reciprocal effects of
   mowing cessation and mowing resumption for 10 years. We analysed
   floristic composition data following four steps. First, we used the
   Community Structure Integrity Index (CSII; Jaunatre et al., ) to obtain
   qualitative and quantitative summaries of taxonomic responses. The
   second step focused on taxonomic biodiversity using species richness,
   Simpson and Pielou indices, and responsive species identified in the
   first step. Third, we analysed functional diversity responses using
   functional groups and community weighted mean (CWM) of vegetative plant
   traits. Finally, we quantified ecosystem services impacts by estimating
   fodder quantity and quality using trait-based models.
   Results: The mowing manipulation demonstrated the high resilience of P.
   paniculata grasslands and revealed reversibility of transitions between
   mown and unmown states. By reducing the abundance of P. paniculata, the
   resumption of mowing restored forage quality. Supported by a
   complementary case study on post-disturbance re-sowing in hay meadows,
   this study demonstrates the resilience of mown subalpine grasslands to
   management change and explores underlying belowground mechanisms of
   vegetative regeneration and belowground reserves.
   Conclusion: Our novel multi-indicator approach provides multifaceted
   mechanistic understanding necessary to anticipate impacts of
   socio-ecological changes and to maintain the multiple benefits of
   mountain grasslands. Addressing the different facets of biodiversity
   from abundance data that are systematically collected in impact or
   monitoring assessment, this approach provides a common framework, widely
   applicable to different types of restoration or management
   interventions, across regions and biota.}},

Abstract = {{The Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University has a long
   tradition of promoting and maintaining high standards of care for their
   collection of more than 13 million objects. Recently, an analysis of the
   current environmental conditions in the three primary museum
   buildings-Peabody Museum of Natural History, Kline Geology Laboratory,
   and the Class of 1954 Environmental Science Center-showed that the
   stability of environmental conditions and efficiency in air-handling
   systems are poorly constrained. An analysis of energy use in climate
   control showed that the Class of 1954 Environmental Science Center, the
   most modern building of the complex, is the least energy-efficient of
   the three and one of the least energy-efficient museum buildings at Yale
   University. The Yale Peabody Museum, in collaboration with the Yale
   Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, evaluated the
   current climate control strategy with an eye toward achieving a more
   practical and responsible approach, which considers the historic
   character of the buildings, high cost of climate control, and
   sensitivity to energy sustainability. This is a key mission of the
   University, as outlined in the Yale Sustainability Plan 2025. The main
   element in the transformation to a new strategy of climate management is
   the assessment of climate-related risks to collections. Our assessment
   indicates that degradation of chemically unstable polymers is the
   process that dominates loss of value of those collections due to
   climate-related risks. It is estimated that chemical degradation
   processes have approximately two orders of magnitude larger impact on
   collection value than the degradation of pyrite and pyrite-containing
   materials and even more than pest damage. Other climate-related
   processes are relatively negligible in effect. These findings allow us
   to change the strategy of climate control, giving priority to
   maintaining low temperature in rooms housing collections made of organic
   materials and relaxing the range of allowable relative humidity
   parameters. The new strategy includes a shift from climate control to
   climate management, including: dual set-point (deadband) controllers to
   reduce energy consumption and lower CO2 emissions, nightly shutdowns of
   the air-handling system serving dry collections in a modern building,
   broader thermal criteria, and a reduction of the amount of fresh air
   introduced to the buildings. These will be implemented sequentially.
   Progress and outcomes will be the focus of a subsequent article.}},

Abstract = {{Sandplain grassland and coastal heathland are globally rare communities
   threatened by succession, development, and shoreline change. Restricted
   mainly to coastal plains of the Northeast. they provide vital habitat
   for many state and regionally rare species, highlighting their
   importance for conservation and restoration. Brush-cutting and
   prescribed lire have been successful in maintaining these communities
   but have proven ineffective in converting overgrown shrubland to an
   earlier successional state. Previous research has established that the
   soil seed bank in overgrown shrubland lacks key dominant grassland
   species, and that while small-scale soil disturbance leads to short-term
   increases in grasses and forbs, woody species rapidly resume dominance.
   We examined whether applying larger-scale soil disturbance in an area
   previously treated with annual brush-cutting could more effectively
   impede woody regrowth while providing an extensive mineral soil seed bed
   to recruit desired vegetation. We evaluated the effectiveness of
   harrowing, harrowing plus seeding, and seeding alone, compared to
   untreated plots and to existing sandplain grassland and coastal
   heathland reference sites. Harrowing stimulated seed bank germination of
   varied native disturbance-associated species. including four
   Massachusetts state-listed rare species that recruited only within the
   harrowed area, and indicated that the seed bank lacked key grassland
   dominants. Comparison to reference grassland and heathland sites
   suggested that harrowing plus seeding more closely approached the
   desired restoration outcome than any other treatment. Our results
   suggest that larger-scale soil disturbance can enhance biodiversity by
   stimulating germination of native early successional plants from the
   seed bank while providing germination sites for sown target species.}},

   distribution in water-limited forests}},
Journal = {{ECOHYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Drought is a key driver of vegetation dynamics, but plant water-uptake
   patterns and consequent plant responses to drought are poorly understood
   at large spatial scales. The capacity of vegetation to use soil water
   depends on its root distribution (RD). However, RD is extremely variable
   in space and difficult to measure in the field, which hinders accurate
   predictions of water fluxes and vegetation dynamics. We propose a new
   method to estimate RD within water balance models, assuming that
   vegetation is at eco-hydrological equilibrium (EHE). EHE conditions
   imply that vegetation optimizes RD such that transpiration is maximized
   within the limits of bearable drought stress, characterized here by
   species-specific hydraulic thresholds. Optimized RD estimates were
   validated against RD estimates obtained by model calibration from sap
   flow or soil moisture from 38 forest plots in Catalonia (NE Spain). In
   water-limited plots, optimized RD was similar to calibrated RD, but
   estimates diverged with higher water availability, suggesting that the
   EHE may not be assumed when water is not limiting. Thereafter, we
   applied the optimization procedure at the regional scale, to estimate RD
   for the water-limited forests of Catalonia. Regional variations of
   optimum RD reproduced many expected patterns in response to climate,
   soil physical properties, forest structure, and species hydraulic
   traits. We conclude that RD optimization, based on the EHE hypothesis
   and a simple description of plant hydraulics, produces realistic
   estimates of RD that can be used for model parameterization and shows
   promise to improve our ability to forecast vegetation dynamics under
   increased drought.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid flow fluctuations experienced downstream of hydropeaking
   facilities can alter the river hydromorphology. Given the dependence of
   riverine fish on physical habitat, those alterations have the potential
   to change the physiology and behaviour of fish. We assessed whether
   artificial velocity refuges mitigated the physiological and behavioural
   consequences of hydropeaking for the Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus
   bocagei). Hydropeaking trials were conducted in an indoor flume equipped
   with deflectors that created low flow velocity areas to serve as
   refuges. The FLOW-3D was used to obtain detailed characterizations of
   the different velocity fields, which facilitated the interpretation of
   fish responses. Changes in flow magnitude and duration triggered stress
   responses, demonstrated by the increased blood glucose levels in the
   single up-ramping event for 60 L s(-1) and in the step up-ramping event.
   Fish tended to seek out velocity refuges to avoid higher flow velocities
   and harsh hydraulic conditions at peak flows, and during the longer
   events. The movement behaviour frequency increased when fish were
   subjected to the highest peak flow (60 L s(-1)), particularly the
   individual sprints and the drifts. For the base flow (7 L s(-1)) and the
   lowest peak flow (20 L s(-1)) conditions, fish swam freely in the flume,
   whereas in the harshest hydraulic conditions they showed more difficulty
   in finding velocity refuges. This research presents a novel approach by
   combining physiology and behavioural observations with hydraulic
   modelling to assess the extent to which artificial flow refuges mitigate
   the consequences of hydropeaking. Our work serves as a model approach
   for future mitigation studies for fish in hydropeaking rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding species' responses to environmental conditions, and how
   these species-environment associations shape spatial distributions, are
   longstanding goals in ecology and biogeography. However, an essential
   component of species-environment relationships - the spatial unit, or
   grain, at which they operate - remains unresolved. We identify three
   components of scale-dependence in analyses of species-environment
   associations: 1) response grain, the grain at which species respond most
   strongly to their environment; 2) environment spatial structure, the
   pattern of spatial autocorrelation intrinsic to an environmental factor;
   and 3) analysis grain, the grain at which analyses are conducted and
   ecological inferences are made.
   We introduce a novel conceptual framework that defines these scale
   components in the context of analyzing species-environment
   relationships, and provide theoretical examples of their interactions
   for species with various ecological attributes. We then use a virtual
   species approach to investigate the impacts of each component on common
   methods of measuring and predicting species-environment relationships.
   We find that environment spatial structure has a substantial impact on
   the ability of even simple, univariate species distribution models
   (SDMs) to recover known species-environment associations at coarse
   analysis grains. For simulated environments with `fine' and
   `intermediate' spatial structure, model explanatory power, and the
   frequency with which simple SDMs correctly estimated a virtual species'
   response to the simulated environment, dramatically declined as analysis
   grain increased.
   Informed by these results, we use a scaling analysis to identify maximum
   analysis grains for individual environmental factors, and a scale
   optimization procedure to determine the grain of maximum predictive
   accuracy. Implementing these analysis grain thresholds and model
   performance standards in an example east African study system yields
   more accurate distribution predictions, compared to SDMs independently
   constructed at arbitrary analysis grains. Finally, we integrate our
   conceptual framework with virtual and empirical results to provide
   practical recommendations for researchers asking common questions about
   species-environment relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Drought stress is an important consideration for wildlife in arid and
   semiarid regions under climate change. Drought can impact plant and
   animal populations directly, through effects on their physiology, as
   well as indirectly through effects on vegetation productivity and
   resource availability, and by creating conditions conducive to secondary
   disturbance, such as wildfire. We implemented a novel approach to
   understanding community-level demographic responses of birds and their
   habitats to these stressors in the context of climate change at 14 study
   sites in the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. A
   large wildfire affecting three of the sites provided a natural
   experiment for also examining fire effects on vegetation and the bird
   community. We assessed (1) trends in drought and end-of-century
   (2071-2100) predicted average drought conditions under mid-range and
   high greenhouse gas concentration trajectory scenarios; (2) effects of
   drought and fire on habitat (vegetation greenness); and (3) effects of
   drought and fire on community-level avian productivity and adult
   apparent survival rates. Drought has increased and is expected to
   increase further at our study sites under climate change. Under spring
   drought conditions, vegetation greenness and avian productivity
   declined, while summer drought appeared to negatively affect adult
   apparent survival rates. Response to fire was mixed; in the year of the
   fire, avian productivity declined, but was higher than normal for
   several years post-fire. Our results highlight important links between
   environmental stressors and avian vital rates that will likely affect
   population trajectories in this region under climate change. We suggest
   that the use and continued development of community-level demographic
   models will provide useful tool for leveraging sparse species-level data

Abstract = {{Cross-cultural environmental monitoring systems inform on a broad suite

   state of two ecologically congruent forests (Whirinaki and Ruathuna), as
   they related to a historic Ruathuna forest state (Baseline; 1955-1975)
   in NZ. Both the plot-based and community-based field surveys indicated
   that the Whirinaki forest was in a better state than the Ruathuna
   forest. This was supported by a stronger mauri (concept of life essence)
   rating assigned by maori elders to the Whirinaki forest compared with
   the Ruathuna forests. However, both the Ruathuna and Whirinaki forests
   were deemed to be in a significantly poorer state than the Baseline

   and associated hydrologic changes are thawing permafrost. Pond formation
   increases winter water temperatures in the pond and downstream, likely

Abstract = {{The aim of nitrate treatment as a restoration method is to bring about a
   reduction of the high potential reactivity of sediments by the oxidation
   of biodegradable organic matter. As a consequence, oxygen uptake by
   sediments is reduced, sulphate reduction is lowered, hydrogen sulphide
   formation diminished and iron present in sediments binds phosphorus (P)
   effectively. This approach was applied in Uzarzewskie Lake, where
   innovative nitrate treatment of sediments was proposed through the
   diversion of subsurface waters to the lake hypolimnion. Nitrate-rich and
   oxygenated water from two tributaries was directly delivered to the
   hypolimnion through pipelines in order to increase redox potential and
   eliminate sediments as a P source. Research on selected physico-chemical
   and biological water characteristics was conducted in the years
   2005-2015 to determine the results of restoration measures.
   P concentrations in lake waters were reduced both in surface water
   layers and the hypolimnion, hence epilimnetic chlorophyll-a content was
   diminished as well. Statistically significant changes in phytoplankton
   community structure were noted as the biomass of cyanobacteria had
   decreased in 2010 and 2013-2014 in comparison to 2006, while
   cryptophytes biomass increased in 2011-2013 in relation to 2007.
   Unfortunately, planktivorous fish domination in fish fauna exert a
   distinct pressure on zooplankton, thus Rotifera dominated and Cladocera
   were rarely noted. Additionally, the morphometric lake features (steep
   slopes, small surface surrounded by forest) create unfavorable
   conditions for submerged macrophyte development, and hinder the
   effectiveness of the restoration. Long-term studies revealed that the
   reconstruction of the phytoplankton community was not permanent, hence
   further restoration activity is required, with the inclusion of new
   techniques. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   to limit global warming below the threshold of 2 degrees C required for
   climate stability. Globally, grasslands occupy 70\% of the world's
   agricultural area, so interventions to farm management practices to
   reduce losses or increase soil carbon stocks in grassland are highly
   relevant. Here, we review the literature with particular emphasis on New
   Zealand and report on the effects of management practices on changes in
   soil carbon stocks for temperate grazed grasslands. We include findings
   from models that explore the trade-offs between multiple desirable
   outcomes, such as increasing soil carbon stocks and milk production.
   Farm management practices can affect soil carbon stocks through changes
   in net primary production, the proportions of biomass removed, the
   degree of stabilisation of carbon in the soil and changes to the rate of
   soil carbon decomposition. The carbon saturation deficit defines the
   potential for a soil to stabilise additional carbon. Earlier reviews
   have concluded that, while labile carbon is the dominant substrate for
   soil carbon decomposition, a fraction of soil carbon stocks is
   stabilised and protected from decomposition by the formation of
   organomineral complexes. Recent evidence shows that the rate of organic
   carbon decomposition is determined primarily by the extent of soil
   organic carbon protection and, therefore, the availability of substrates
   to microbial activity.
   New Zealand grassland systems have moderate to high soil carbon stocks
   in the surface layers (i.e., upper 0.15 m) where most roots are located,
   so the carbon saturation deficit is relatively low and the scope to
   increase soil carbon stocks by carbon inputs from primary production may
   be limited. International studies have shown that the addition of
   fertilisers, feed imports, and applications of manure and effluent can
   increase soil carbon stocks, especially for degraded soils, but the
   responses in New Zealand soils are uncertain because of the limited
   number of studies. However, recent evidence shows that irrigation can
   reduce soil carbon stocks in New Zealand, but neither the processes nor
   the long-term trends are known. Studies of sward renewal have shown that
   shortterm losses of carbon losses resulting from the disturbance can be
   mitigated using rapid replacement of the new sward, minimum tillage and
   avoidance of times when the soil water content is high. Swards
   comprising multiple species have also shown that soil carbon stocks may
   be increased after periods of several years. Model simulations have
   shown that the goal of increasing both soil carbon and milk production
   could be achieved best by increasing carbon inputs from supplementary
   animal feed. However, losses of carbon at feed export sites need to be
   minimised to achieve overall net gains in soil carbon. Grazing intensity
   can have a big influence on soil carbon stocks but the magnitude and
   direction of the effects are not consistent between studies.
   Biochar addition could possibly increase soil carbon stocks but it is
   not yet an economical option for large scale application in New Zealand.
   There is some evidence that the introduction of earthworms and dung
   beetles could potentially increase soil carbon stabilisation, but the
   greenhouse gas benefits are confounded by possible increases in nitrous
   oxide emissions. The new practice of full inversion tillage during
   grassland renewal has the potential to increase soil carbon stocks under
   suitable conditions but full life-cycle analysis including the effects
   of the disruptive operations has yet to be completed.
   We conclude with a list of criteria that determine the success and
   suitability of management options to increase soil carbon stocks and
   identify priority research questions that need to be addressed using
   experimental and modelling approaches to optimise management options to
   increase soil carbon stocks.}},

Abstract = {{GDP, as a key parameter for macro-economic policy, has long been
   criticized. One of the better known monetary alternatives to GDP is the
   ISEW, a synthetic proxy of sustainable welfare. Theoretical and
   methodological limitations of this indicator have been identified and
   several refinements or extensions proposed, GPI for example. Building on
   these approaches, this article presents a new composite flow-oriented
   indicator directly comparable with GDP. The proposed Sustainable Welfare
   Index (SWI) is calculated for the Italian case over the 1960-2014
   period. The estimate of SWI over an extended period of fifty-four years,
   provides evidence for a previously undetected ``threshold effect{''} in
   Italy by means of a flow-oriented indicator - unlike GDP, SWI per capita
   stops increasing in 1991. Empirical results show that the level of
   sustainable welfare in Italy stops growing mainly because of a rise in
   income inequality, a decline in non-paid domestic work and a worsening
   of the net fixed capital formation and net international investment

Abstract = {{In rhythmic tree growth, the alternation between growth and resting
   phases can be either periodic or irregular, depending on climatic and
   endogenous factors. The aim of this study was to analyze the growth
   pattern of yerbamate, a subtropical South American tree with monopodial
   and rhythmic growth, over a two-year period. Metamer emission rate of
   selected axes was followed during two years after a severe pruning in
   two cultivation systems contrasting for light conditions, agroforestry
   system and monoculture. A new longitudinal data modeling approach
   relying on hidden semi Markov chains to identify growth and resting
   phases and multiple change point models to relate these phases to
   climatic factors was used. Despite large variability among individuals,
   two growth phases separated by a resting phase were most often
   identified within each year. Contrasting situations regarding the
   modulation of the polycyclism were observed between the two years and
   cultivated systems: in the first year of growth, the pattern consisted
   of a single long growth phase in vigorous individuals and the
   cultivation system had a major effect, likely due to the induced light
   environment; in the second year, some individuals did not grow during
   the second autumn phase likely due to the drought during the warm
   season. The observed differences in growth patterns between years and
   cultivation systems were interpreted with respect to ontogenetic and
   climatic effects, in interaction with endogenous factors resulting from
   plant reproductive phenology. This study introduces a new longitudinal
   data analysis approach for investigating the phenology of perennial

Abstract = {{Simulation models have a broad potential as decision-support tools for
   resource management by mechanistically representing and projecting
   complex ecological processes. In the case of socioeconomically and
   biologically important coral reef ecosystems, models have been used to
   address important questions regarding the effects of human impacts on
   their ecological dynamics and to inform management approaches. However,
   few of the models integrate benthic and fish dynamics with the influence
   of external anthropogenic stressors, and virtually none is available as
   a user-friendly platform for non-scientist managers to easily access. We
   propose a new ecological model to assess the effects of simultaneous
   stressors on coral reef ecosystems which includes a dynamic
   representation of benthic and fish spatial processes, linked by their
   ecological feedbacks. SEAMANCORE is a two-dimensional model representing
   the dynamics of local coral reefs which can be used to explore the
   influence of bleaching, eutrophication, and fishing, including
   destructive fishing such as bomb and cyanide fishing. The model is
   coupled with a menu-based interface that allows users with no
   programming experience to simulate numerous scenarios in specific
   contexts that can be customized with depth profile maps and initial
   coral reef conditions of fish and benthos functional group abundance.
   This study includes SEAMANCORE's description and shows the model's
   sensitivity to its parameters by means of sensitivity analyses. Its
   utility is exemplified by exploring various scenarios of no stressors,
   fishing and bleaching regimes in a theoretical coral reef. We expect
   that linking fish demographics with changing habitat quality will prove
   insightful for fisheries management.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{384}},
Pages = {{316-332}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{With access to collections of continuous satellite imagery over a
   40-year period, spectral-temporal patterns extracted from multi-temporal
   imagery offer a potential new tool to model mechanisms of forest
   succession and monitor changes in forested landscapes. Specifically,
   spectral-temporal trajectories associated with successional forest
   change occurring over prolonged periods of time may enhance periodic
   `snapshot' monitoring methods, especially for species that exhibit
   complex and non-linear dynamics. In this paper, Landsat time-series are
   used to examine the spectral-temporal signatures of bamboo-dominated
   forest succession occurring within the critically threatened Araucaria
   Forest, a pine-dominated subtype of the Atlantic Forest in southern
   Brazil. Alteration of canopy structure through ongoing anthropogenic
   disturbance has increased understorey light climate and given
   opportunity for native invasive bamboos to flourish, resulting in
   drastic reduction of tree regeneration and loss of biodiversity. We
   aimed to evaluate how spectral-temporal signatures could be used to (1)
   characterize stages of bamboo-dominated forest succession, (2) identify
   synchrony of bamboo lifecycle dynamics and (3) classify regions of
   bamboo-dominated forest. Changepoint analysis was performed using an
   extracted sample spectral-temporal signature and trajectories were fit
   to the resulting segments using linear regression. Based on slope values
   of the fitted segments, a novel description incorporating temporal
   information of bamboo-dominated forest succession was developed which
   identified four broad phases: pioneer predominance, mature bamboo,
   dieback and pioneer regeneration. To determine the spatial and temporal
   synchrony of bamboo-dominated forest succession, a hybrid model was
   developed by combining the modelled segments and compared to a 32-year
   Landsat time-series of vegetation indices by calculating root-mean
   square error between each pixel in the study area. The hybrid model
   proficiently classified regions of bamboo-dominance, achieving between
   77\% and 90\% accuracy, which also indicated lifecycle synchrony of
   bamboo populations within the study area. To further assess the
   performance of the hybrid model, a time-weighted dynamic time warping
   model approach was used to determine synchrony and classify regions of
   bamboo. The time weighted dynamic time warping classifier had lower
   overall accuracy (68\%-82\%), but is still considered a useful tool for
   automated classification purposes that take advantage of multi-temporal
   imagery. To compare classification performance between `snapshot' and
   multi-temporal imagery classifiers, a maximum-likelihood classification
   was performed, which attained lower overall accuracies than the hybrid
   model (75\%-84\%). Overall, the use of spectral-temporal signatures
   offers a novel and effective approach to both describing and modelling
   bamboo-dominated forest succession (and forest successional processes
   more generally) on a landscape-scale.}},

Abstract = {{Variable selection in ecological niche modelling can influence model
   projections to a degree comparable to variations in future climate
   scenarios. Consequently, it is important to select feature (variable)
   subsets for optimizing model performance and characterizing variability.
   We utilize a novel random subset feature selection algorithm (RSFSA) for
   niche modelling to select an ensemble of optimally sized feature subsets
   of limited correlation (vertical bar r vertical bar < 0.7) from 90
   climatic, topographic and anthropogenic indices, generating wildfire
   activity models for western North America with higher performance.
   Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity and LANDFIRE wildfire data were used
   to develop thousands of MaxEnt, GLM and Glmnet models. The
   RSFSA-selected models performed better than random models, having higher
   accuracy (Area Under the Curve statistic; AUC), lower complexity
   (corrected Akaike Information Criterion; AICc), and, in some cases,
   lower overfitting (AUC(diff)). The RSFSA-selected MaxEnt quadratic/hinge
   (beta-regularization 2) feature models generally had higher AUC and
   lower AICc, outperforming other niche model parameterizations and
   methods. Feature subset ensembles of RSFSA-selected 15-variable MaxEnt
   quadratic/hinge models were used to characterize variability in
   projected areas of large wildfires for three burn severities under
   current, 2050, and 2070 climate scenarios. Expert screening of variables
   before RSFSA did not improve model performance. Widespread contemporary
   wildfire deficits and projected regional changes in wildfires highlight
   the need to manage fuel loads and restore natural fire regimes. The
   RSFSA is valuable for optimizing niche model performance and generating
   feature subset ensembles to characterize model variability across niche
   models of various feature subset sizes, modelling methods, and climate

   This study shows that remote sensing technique can be quite rewarding
   for capturing regional scenario on spatial distribution of timberlines.
   We could provide several new information on the spatial patterns of
   Indian Central Himalayan timberline. Firstly, the length of timberline
   is far longer than generally indicated by field sampling approach alone.
   In Uttarakhand it was 2750 km long within a crow flight distance of
   about one hundred km. Secondly, the segmentation of timberline due to
   immature topography and high tectonic activities is quite common.
   Thirdly, small timberlines enclosing small summits covered with alpine
   meadows are common feature in this part of Himalayas where forests grow
   up to considerably high elevations. In such cases climate warming is
   expected to drive the accumulation of species around the summits under
   the influence of global warming. Fourthly, it is long continuous
   timberline where much of the upward movement of plants would take place
   because of the availability of land areas between snowline and
   timberline. Such information about regional timberline will improve our
   understanding about influence of regional peculiarities on current

Abstract = {{Reserve selections are often opportunistic rather than strategic and

   their intended goals of conservation. Here, we assessed the conservation
   effectiveness of a reserve for the golden snub-nosed monkeys

   habitat usage of the monkeys in Shennongjia Nature Reserve (SNR) and
   attributes of 14 environmental variables that could potentially affect
   the monkeys' habitat use. Spatial distribution of potentially suitable
   habitat for the monkeys was then modeled with Maxent, a niche-based
   model, and conservation effectiveness of SNR was assessed by comparing
   the current boundary of the reserve with the spatial distribution of the
   modeled potential habitat and the current habitat area of the monkeys.
   Only 59\% of the habitat area and 61\% of the predicted potential
   habitat area were under the protection of SNR. To improve conservation
   effectiveness of SNR, we proposed that the current SNR be enlarged by
   270km(2). The enlarged reserve would encompass 100\% of the existing
   habitat area plus 89\% of the predicted potential habitat area. Using
   the niche-based approach, we were able to integrate habitat usage data

Abstract = {{Collecting data on unlicensed open-access coastal activities, such as
   some types of recreational fishing, has often relied on telephone
   interviews selected from landline directories. However, this approach is
   becoming obsolete due to changes in communication technology such as a
   switch to unlisted mobile phones. Other methods, such as boat ramp
   interviews, are often impractical due to high labor cost. We trialed an
   autonomous, ultra-high-resolution photosampling method as a cost effect
   solution for direct measurements of a recreational fishery. Our
   sequential photosampling was batched processed using a novel software
   application to produce big data time series movies from a spatial subset
   of the fishery, and we validated this with a regional bus-route survey
   and interviews with participants at access points. We also compared
   labor costs between these two methods. Most trailer boat users were
   recreational fishers targeting tuna spp. Our camera system closely
   matched trends in temporal variation from the larger scale regional
   survey, but as the camera data were at much higher frequency, we could
   additionally describe strong, daily variability in effort. Peaks were
   normally associated with weekends, but consecutive weekend tuna fishing
   competitions led to an anomaly of high effort across the normal weekday
   lulls. By reducing field time and batch processing imagery, Monthly
   labor costs for the camera sampling were a quarter of the bus-route
   survey; and individual camera samples cost 2.5\% of bus route samples to
   obtain. Gigapixel panoramic camera observations of fishing were
   representative of the temporal variability of regional fishing effort
   and could be used to develop a cost-efficient index. High-frequency
   sampling had the added benefit of being more likely to detect abnormal
   patterns of use. Combinations of remote sensing and on-site interviews
   may provide a solution to describing highly variable effort in
   recreational fisheries while also validating activity and catch.}},

Abstract = {{Mature forests have structural habitat features that can take hundreds

   outlines a proposed new approach to managing mature forest features, the

   objective was to maintain a network of current and future mature forest
   habitat distributed across the landscape. The approach is designed to
   complement the existing reserve network and management actions and is
   tenure-blind. Spatial information on the availability of mature forest
   habitat at the local (1-km radius) and landscape (5-km radius) scales is
   used for decisions on retention within a 1-km radius of a harvest area,
   to reach the minimum target of 20\% and 30\% retention of mature forest
   at the local and landscape spatial scales, respectively. We believe this
   approach could contribute to meeting the conservation needs of many

Abstract = {{International and national guidelines and regulations to limit the
   inadvertent transfer of non-native species on the submerged surfaces of
   vessels and mobile infrastructure are progressing. However, methods to
   assess compliance must be developed to assist both regulators and
   industry. While there is a history of biofouling inspections in maritime
   industries, including commercial shipping and infrastructure, such
   surveys are tailored for vessel safety and performance rather than being
   driven by biosecurity purposes. Thus, these inspections are likely
   inadequate for confirming compliance with biosecurity regulations. To
   determine regulatory compliance, agencies will likely rely on a
   combination of risk profiling, assessment of documentation of biofouling
   management, archival data and images, and real-time in-water surveys
   made by divers or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) specific to
   biosecurity regulations. Divers may exceed ROVs at finding organisms in
   recesses and other topographically complex areas, and when regulations
   require confirmation of species identity or viability. In contrast, ROVs
   may be well suited for regulations that establish upper thresholds on
   biofouling levels with little concern for organism identity or
   condition. Several factors will inform how a survey is conducted,
   including cost, the type of data required by regulations, environmental
   conditions, safety, and logistics. Survey designs and requirements
   should be transparent to manage industry's expectations of border
   procedures, to increase the efficiency with which industry and agencies
   manage biofouling and potentially align the evaluation of best practices
   in hull and niche area maintenance across jurisdictions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Characterising the spatiotemporal variation of animal behaviour can
   elucidate the way individuals interact with their environment and
   allocate energy. Increasing sophistication of tracking technologies
   paired with novel analytical approaches allows the characterisation of
   movement dynamics even when an individual is not directly observable.
   2. In this study, high-resolution movement data collected via global
   positioning system (GPS) tracking in three dimensions were paired with
   topographical information and used in a Bayesian state-space model to
   describe the flight modes of migrating golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos)
   in eastern North America.
   3. Our model identified five functional behavioural states, two of which
   were previously undescribed variations on thermal soaring. The other
   states comprised gliding, perching and orographic soaring. States were
   discriminated by movement features in the horizontal (step length and
   turning angle) and vertical (change in altitude) planes and by the
   association with ridgelines promoting wind deflection. Tracked eagles
   spent 2\%, 31\%, 38\%, 9\% and 20\% of their daytime in directed thermal
   soaring, gliding, convoluted thermal soaring, perching and orographic
   soaring, respectively. The analysis of the relative occurrence of these
   flight modes highlighted yearly, seasonal, age, individual and sex
   differences in flight strategy and performance. Particularly, less
   energy-efficient orographic soaring was more frequent in autumn, when
   thermals were less available. Adult birds were also better at optimising
   energy efficiency than subadults.
   4. Our approach represents the first example of a state-space model for
   bird flight mode using altitude data in conjunction with horizontal
   locations and is applicable to other flying organisms where similar data
   are available. The ability to describe animal movements in a
   three-dimensional habitat is critical to advance our understanding of
   the functional processes driving animals' decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Shifting disturbance regimes can have cascading effects on many
   ecosystems processes. This is particularly true when the scale of the
   disturbance no longer matches the regeneration strategy of the dominant
   vegetation. In the yellow pine and mixed conifer forests of California,
   over a century of fire exclusion and the warming climate are increasing
   the incidence and extent of stand-replacing wildfire; such changes in
   severity patterns are altering regeneration dynamics by dramatically
   increasing the distance from live tree seed sources. This has raised
   concerns about limitations to natural reforestation and the potential
   for conversion to non-forested vegetation types, which in turn has
   implications for shifts in many ecological processes and ecosystem
   services. We used a California region-wide data set with 1,848 plots
   across 24 wildfires in yellow pine and mixed conifer forests to build a
   spatially explicit habitat suitability model for forecasting postfire
   forest regeneration. To model the effect of seed availability, the
   critical initial biological filter for regeneration, we used a novel
   approach to predicting spatial patterns of seed availability by
   estimating annual seed production from existing basal area and burn
   severity maps. The probability of observing any conifer seedling in a
   60-m(2) area (the field plot scale) was highly dependent on 30-yr
   average annual precipitation, burn severity, and seed availability. We
   then used this model to predict regeneration probabilities across the
   entire extent of a new fire (the 2014 King Fire), which highlights the
   spatial variability inherent in postfire regeneration patterns. Such
   forecasts of postfire regeneration patterns are of importance to land
   managers and conservationists interested in maintaining forest cover on
   the landscape. Our tool can also help anticipate shifts in ecosystem
   properties, supporting researchers interested in investigating questions
   surrounding alternative stable states, and the interaction of altered
   disturbance regimes and the changing climate.}},

Abstract = {{Resilience is a major research focus covering a wide range of topics
   from biodiversity conservation to ecosystem (service) management. Model
   simulations can assess the resilience of, for example, plant species,
   measured as the return time to conditions prior to a disturbance. This
   requires process-based models (PBM) that implement relevant processes
   such as regeneration and reproduction and thus successfully reproduce
   transient dynamics after disturbances. Such models are often complex and
   thus limited to either short-term or small-scale applications, whereas
   many research questions require species predictions across larger
   spatial and temporal scales. We suggest a framework to couple a PBM and
   a statistical species distribution model (SDM), which transfers the
   results of a resilience analysis by the PBM to SDM predictions. The
   resulting hybrid model combines the advantages of both approaches: the
   convenient applicability of SDMs and the relevant process detail of PBMs
   in abrupt environmental change situations. First, we simulate dynamic
   responses of species communities to a disturbance event with a PBM. We
   aggregate the response behavior in two resilience metrics: return time
   and amplitude of the response peak. These metrics are then used to
   complement long-term SDM projections with dynamic short-term responses
   to disturbance. To illustrate our framework, we investigate the effect
   of abrupt short-term groundwater level and salinity changes on coastal
   vegetation at the German Baltic Sea. We found two example species to be
   largely resilient, and, consequently, modifications of SDM predictions
   consisted mostly of smoothing out peaks in the occurrence probability
   that were not confirmed by the PBM. Discrepancies between SDM- and
   PBM-predicted species responses were caused by community dynamics
   simulated in the PBM and absent from the SDM. Although demonstrated with
   boosted regression trees (SDM) and an existing individual-based model,
   IBC-grass (PBM), our flexible framework can easily be applied to other
   PBM and SDM types, as well as other definitions of short-term
   disturbances or long-term trends of environmental change. Thus, our
   framework allows accounting for biological feedbacks in the response to
   short- and long-term environmental changes as a major advancement in
   predictive vegetation modeling.}},

Title = {{Exploring invasibility with species distribution modeling: How does fire
   promote cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) invasion within lower montane
   forests?}},
Journal = {{DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is notorious for creating positive
   feedbacks that facilitate vegetation type conversion within sagebrush
   steppe ecosystems in the western United States. Similar dynamics may
   exist in adjacent lower montane forest. However, fire-forest-cheatgrass
   dynamics have not been examined. We used species distribution modeling
   to answer three questions about fire and invasibility in lower montane
   forests: (Q1) Does fire create more suitable habitat for cheatgrass?
   (Q2) If so, which site attributes are altered to increase site
   suitability? (Q3) Does fire increase connectivity among suitable habitat
   and enhance spread?
   Location: Shoshone National Forest, Wyoming, USA.
   Methods: We measured cheatgrass presence-absence in 93 plots within
   Interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) forests. Random
   Forests predicted cheatgrass distribution with and without fire using
   nine site attributes: elevation, slope, aspect, solar radiation, annual
   precipitation, maximum temperature in July, minimum temperature in
   January, forest canopy cover and distance to nearest trail or road.
   Additionally, invasion pathways and spread were mapped using
   Circuitscape.
   Results: Cheatgrass distribution was controlled by topographic and
   climate variables in the absence of fire. In particular, cheatgrass was
   most likely to occur at low elevation along dry, south- and east-facing
   slopes. High-severity fire increased potential cheatgrass distribution
   when forest canopy cover was reduced to below 30\%. This process created
   new invasion pathways, which enhanced cheatgrass spread when modelled in
   Circuitscape.
   Main conclusions: Our study showed that in the absence of fire, drier
   south- and east-facing slopes at low elevation are most susceptible to
   cheatgrass invasion. However, high-severity fire increased the total
   area susceptible to invasion-allowing cheatgrass to expand into
   previously unsuitable sites within lower montane forests in the western
   United States. These results are important for present day management
   and reflect that integrating responses to disturbance in species
   distribution models can be critical for making predictions about
   dynamically changing systems.}},

Abstract = {{Animal movement, whether for foraging, mate-seeking, predator avoidance,
   dispersal, or migration, is a fundamental aspect of ecology that shapes
   spatial abundance distributions, genetic compositions, and dynamics of
   populations. A variety of movement models have been used for predicting
   the effects of natural or human-caused landscape changes, invading
   species, or other disturbances on local ecology. Here we introduce the
   flow network-a general modeling framework for population dynamics and
   movement in a metapopulation representing a network of habitat sites
   (nodes). Based on the principles of physical transport phenomena such as
   fluid flow through pipes (Pouiselle's Law) and analogously, the flow of
   electric current across a circuit (Ohm's Law), the flow network provides
   a novel way of modeling movement, where flow rates are functions of
   relative node pressures and the resistance to movement between them.
   Flow networks offer the flexibility of incorporating abiotic and biotic
   conditions that affect either pressures, resistance, or both. To
   illustrate an application of the flow network, we present a theoretical
   invasion scenario. We consider the effects of spatial structure on the
   speed of invasion by varying the spatial regularity of node arrangement.
   In the context of invasion, we model management actions targeting nodes
   or edges, and consider the effects on speed of invasion, node
   occupation, and total abundance. The flow network approach offers the
   flexibility to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in both rates of flow
   and site pressures and offers an intuitive approach to connecting
   population dynamics and landscape features to model movement.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change will not only shift environmental means but will also
   increase the intensity of extreme events, exerting additional stress on
   ecosystems. While field observations on the ecological consequences of
   heat waves are emerging, experimental evidence is rare, and lacking at
   the community level. Using a novel near-natural outdoor mesocosms
   approach, this study tested whether marine summer heat waves have
   detrimental consequences for macrofauna of a temperate coastal
   community, and whether sequential heat waves provoke an increase or
   decrease of sensitivity to thermal stress. Three treatments were
   applied, defined and characterized through a statistical analysis of 15
   years of temperature records from the experimental site: (1) no heat
   wave, (2) two heat waves in June and July followed by a summer heat wave
   in August and (3) the summer heat wave only. Overall, 50\% of the
   species showed positive, negative or positive/negative responses in
   either abundance and/or biomass. We highlight four possible ways in
   which single species responded to either three subsequent heat waves or
   one summer heat wave: (1) absence of a response (tolerance, 50\% of
   species), (2) negative accumulative effects by three subsequent heat
   waves (tellinid bivalve), (3) buffering by proceeding heat waves due to
   acclimation and/or shifts in phenology (spionid polychaete) and (4) an
   accumulative positive effect by subsequent heat waves (amphipod). The
   differential responses to single or sequential heat waves at the species
   level entailed shifts at the community level. Community-level
   differences between single and triple heat waves were more pronounced
   than those between regimes with vs. without heat waves. Detritivory was
   reduced by the single heat wave while suspension feeding was less common
   in the triple heat wave regime. Critical extreme events occur already
   today and will occur more frequently in a changing climate, thus,
   leading to detrimental impacts on coastal marine systems.}},

Abstract = {{Phenological synchrony can promote population growth in species with
   positive density dependence. Variation among life stages in the thermal
   thresholds for development can foster phenological synchrony under
   thermal regimes that include frequent occurrence of temperatures between
   developmental thresholds. The southern pine beetle is an insect with
   positive density dependence that has recently undergone important shifts
   in population abundance at the northern extremes of their distribution.
   We evaluated the hypothesis that cooler winter temperatures in their
   northern range cause a convergence of the population life stage
   structure that leads to synchrony in spring flight phenology. We used a
   combination of approaches. First, in situ laboratory experiments
   demonstrated a threshold temperature for pupation that was greater than
   was required for larval development; rearing larvae at lower
   temperatures increased the pooling of individuals at the end stage of
   larval development and synchrony in adult emergence. Second, a
   development rate model showed a similar convergence of the majority of
   the population at the end stage of larval development when brood
   experienced the cooler temperatures of the northern region, but not with
   temperatures from the southern region, or as a null model. Finally,
   field trapping of wild beetles showed greater synchrony in the pine
   forests of New Jersey than in the warmer, historically occupied forests
   of Georgia and Mississippi. Given these results, pine-dominated forests
   in the northern edge of the southern pine beetle's range may experience
   more frequent occurrence of outbreaks, due to the positive feedbacks
   associated with a synchronous spring emergence of this insect.}},

Abstract = {{Urban trees reduce respirable particulate matter (PM10) concentrations

   cost-effective targeting. We adapt published methods to estimate the
   impact of a decade (2004-2014) of tree cover change on city-level PM10
   and heat mitigation in 27 U.S. cities and present a new methodology for
   estimating local-level PM10 and heat mitigation by street trees and tree
   patches. We map potential tree planting sites in the 27 cities and use
   our local-level PM10 and heat mitigation methods to assess the
   population-weighted return on investment (ROI) of each site for PM10 and
   heat abatement for nearby populations. Twenty-three of the 27 cities
   lost canopy cover during 2004-2014, reducing estimated city-level PMic,
   removal by 6\% (168 tons) and increasing city-level average maximum
   daily summer temperature by 0.1 degrees C on average across cities. We
   find large potential for urban reforestation to increase PM10 and heat
   abatement. Infra-city variation in planting site ROI - driven primarily
   by differences in population density around planting sites - exceeds
   four orders of magnitude, indicating large scope for targeting to
   increase PM10 and heat abatement from reforestation. Reforesting each

Abstract = {{The western tropical South Pacific was sampled along a longitudinal 4000

   measurement of carbonate parameters (total alkalinity and total
   inorganic carbon) between the Melanesian Archipelago (MA) and the
   western part of the South Pacific gyre (WGY). This paper reports this
   new dataset and derived properties: pH on the total scale (pH(T)) and
   the CaCO3 saturation state with respect to aragonite (Omega(ara)). We
   also estimate anthropogenic carbon (C-ANT) distribution in the water
   column using the TrOCA method (Tracer combining Oxygen, inorganic Carbon
   and total Alkalinity) Along the OUTPACE transect a deeper penetration of
   C-ANT in the intermediate waters was observed in the MA, whereas highest
   C-ANT concentrations were detected in the subsurface waters of the WGY.
   By combining our OUTPACE dataset with data available in GLODAPv2
   (1974-2009), temporal changes in oceanic inorganic carbon were
   evaluated. An increase of 1.3 to 1.6 mu mol kg(-1) a(-1) for total
   inorganic carbon in the upper thermocline waters is estimated, whereas
   C-ANT increases by 1.1 to 1.2 mu mol kg(-1) a(-1). In the MA
   intermediate waters (27 kg m(-3) < sigma(theta) < 27.2 kg m(-3)) an
   increase of 0.4 mu mol kg(-1) a(-1) C-ANT is detected. Our results
   suggest a clear progression of ocean acidification in the western

   few studies take into consideration the interconnected relationship
   between the social processes underpinning knowledge accumulation,
   generation and transmission. The study draws on ethnobotanical research
   to explore plant uses, practices and belief systems developed among the
   indigenous Vhavenda in South Africa for sustaining indigenous plant
   resources and highlights some of the forces of change influencing the
   acquisition and transmission of knowledge.
   Methods: Data was collected from September-November 2016 from 31
   individuals by means of semi-structured interviews; walks in home
   gardens, cultivated fields, montane forests and deciduous woodlands; and
   vouchering of plant species in six villages (Duthuni, Tshidzivhe, Vuvha,
   Lwamondo, Mashau and Tshiendeulu) in the Vhembe District of South
   Africa. The Use Value Index (UVI) was used to measure the number of
   different uses of each species and the Relative Frequency Index (RFI) to
   measure the local importance of each species. Semi-structured interviews
   and comparisons with published works also explored cultural practices
   and belief systems associated with plants, modes and barriers of
   knowledge transmission.
   Results: Eighty-four plant species were reported within 44 families,
   with Fabaceae representing the highest diversity of plant species. We
   identified six species not previously documented in the Vhavenda
   ethnobotanical literature, 68 novel uses of plants and another 14
   variations of known uses. Vhavenda plants were predominantly used for
   food (36.0\%) and medicine (26.1\%) and consisted mainly of native
   (73.8\%) compared to non-native species (26.2\%). The Vhavenda possess a
   range of practices for managing plant resources that can be attributed
   to taboos preventing the use of selected species, promotion of
   sustainable harvesting practices and the propagation of plant species
   for ecological restoration. Plant knowledge and management practices
   were transmitted from relatives (48.4\%), self-taught through time spent
   planting and harvesting plants on the land (19.4\%), through
   apprenticeships with traditional healers (16.1\%), initiation schools
   (9. 7\%) and clan gatherings (6.4\%). Changes in traditional learning
   platforms for knowledge exchange, erosion of cultural institutions and
   shifting value systems serve as barriers for knowledge transmission
   among the Vhavenda.
   Conclusion: The study points to a need for new partnerships to be forged
   between conservationists, government actors and local and indigenous
   knowledge holders to foster hybrid knowledge coproduction for developing
   strategies to enhance the productivity and biodiversity of indigenous
   lands.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term environmental research networks are one approach to advancing
   local, regional, and global environmental science and education. A
   remarkable number and wide variety of environmental research networks
   operate around the world today. These are diverse in funding,
   infrastructure, motivating questions, scientific strengths, and the
   sciences that birthed and maintain the networks. Some networks have
   individual sites that were selected because they had produced invaluable
   long-term data, while other networks have new sites selected to span
   ecological gradients. However, all long-term environmental networks
   share two challenges. Networks must keep pace with scientific advances
   and interact with both the scientific community and society at large. If
   networks fall short of successfully addressing these challenges, they
   risk becoming irrelevant. The objective of this paper is to assert that
   the biogeosciences offer environmental research networks a number of
   opportunities to expand scientific impact and public engagement. We
   explore some of these opportunities with four networks: the
   International Long-Term Ecological Research Network programs (ILTERs),
   critical zone observatories (CZOs), Earth and ecological observatory
   networks (EONs), and the FLUXNET program of eddy flux sites. While these
   networks were founded and expanded by interdisciplinary scientists, the
   preponderance of expertise and funding has gravitated activities of
   ILTERs and EONs toward ecology and biology, CZOs toward the Earth
   sciences and geology, and FLUXNET toward ecophysiology and
   micrometeorology. Our point is not to homogenize networks, nor to
   diminish disciplinary science. Rather, we argue that by more fully
   incorporating the integration of biology and geology in long-term
   environmental research networks, scientists can better leverage network
   assets, keep pace with the ever-changing science of the environment, and
   engage with larger scientific and public audiences.}},

Title = {{A beta distribution-based moment closure enhances the reliability of

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{381}},
Pages = {{46-77}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Ecological communities are complex adaptive systems that exhibit
   remarkable feedbacks between their biomass and trait dynamics.
   Trait-based aggregate models cope with this complexity by focusing on
   the temporal development of the community's aggregate properties such as
   its total biomass, mean trait and trait variance. They are based on
   particular assumptions about the shape of the underlying trait
   distribution, which is commonly assumed to be normal. However,
   ecologically important traits are usually restricted to a finite range,
   and empirical trait distributions are often skewed or multimodal. As a
   result, normal distribution-based aggregate models may fail to
   adequately represent the biomass and trait dynamics of natural
   communities. We resolve this mismatch by developing a new moment closure
   approach assuming the trait values to be beta-distributed. We show that
   the beta distribution captures important shape properties of both
   observed and simulated trait distributions, which cannot be captured by
   a Gaussian. We further demonstrate that a beta distribution-based moment
   closure can strongly enhance the reliability of trait-based aggregate
   models. We compare the biomass, mean trait and variance dynamics of a
   full trait distribution (FD) model to the ones of beta (BA) and normal
   (NA) distribution-based aggregate models, under different selection
   regimes. This way, we demonstrate under which general conditions
   (stabilizing, fluctuating or disruptive selection) different aggregate
   models are reliable tools. All three models predicted very similar
   biomass and trait dynamics under stabilizing selection yielding unimodal
   trait distributions with small standing trait variation. We also
   obtained an almost perfect match between the results of the FD and BA
   models under fluctuating selection, promoting skewed trait distributions
   and ongoing oscillations in the biomass and trait dynamics. In contrast,
   the NA model showed unrealistic trait dynamics and exhibited different
   alternative stable states, and thus a high sensitivity to initial
   conditions under fluctuating selection. Under disruptive selection, both
   aggregate models failed to reproduce the results of the FD model with
   the mean trait values remaining within their ecologically feasible
   ranges in the BA model but not in the NA model. Overall, a beta
   distribution-based moment closure strongly improved the realism of
   trait-based aggregate models.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1905-1916}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{AimThis study analyses the places and the scales at which the
   latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) for vertebrate species holds or,
   conversely, fails. Although much empirical support for the LDG at a
   global scale exists, several marked departures have also been previously
   reported for some regions, scales and organisms. Here, we aim to test
   the generality of the LDG by accurately quantifying its variability
   among regions and scales using a novel analysing approach applied on
   environmental and species data.
   LocationGlobal; Vertebrate species (amphibians, mammals and birds).
   MethodsTo test the LDG, we proceeded in two successive steps. First, we
   collected environmental and vertebrate species data to summarize the
   overall environment (likely the LDG). In a second step, we compared the
   two datasets (environment and species biodiversity index maps) using the
   Comparison Map and Profile (CMP) method. It computes the correlation
   between datasets in moving windows, all over both maps (at one scale),
   and by increasing the size (scale) of the moving windows.
   Cross-correlations are then spatially computed through all scales in
   order to map and accurately quantify the relationship between
   environment and biodiversity on Earth.
   ResultsThe best environmental variable, explaining almost 70\% of the
   spatial variation in vertebrate species richness, was the temperature
   seasonality composite (TSC), a good surrogate candidate for the LDG.
   While the TSC-diversity relationship followed an expected LDG-like
   pattern in the Southern Hemisphere and in the tropics, it showed
   significant departures from latitudinal trends in Asia and North
   America. This observation can be explained by the increase in animal
   species number with increasing northern latitudes.
   Main conclusionsWe showed that the LDG (i.e. through the TSC surrogate)
   relationship fails in many places and at all scales in average. We must
   then reject the mainstream hypothesis of the overall worldwide LDG
   pattern. We suggest that it should not be taken for granted in
   macroecological studies, especially over the Northern Hemisphere. The
   spatial distribution of vertebrate richness is both area and scale
   dependent, and this observation is robust to changes in spatial
   resolution, in data coverage (e.g. ecoregions) and in taxa.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Eastern U.S. forests are witnessing an ecologically disruptive decline
   in one of the region's distinctive foundation tree species, the eastern
   hemlock (Tsuga canadenis). The exotic insect pests hemlock woolly
   adelgid (Adelges tsugae, HWA) and elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia
   externa) have greatly altered many forest ecosystems previously
   dominated by this important evergreen conifer. The consequences for
   ecosystem processes are far reaching because hemlock is often replaced
   by deciduous tree species, such as black birch (Betula lenta), which
   have strongly divergent effects on forest floor microenvironments and
   nutrient cycling. We took advantage of an accidental experiment
   initiated by patch-level timber harvesting similar to 30 yr ago to
   investigate how the removal of hemlock, and its replacement by deciduous
   trees, has affected leaf litter characteristics, soil organic layer
   mass, C:N content, and soil respiration rates. We also contrasted these
   areas to nearby forest plots where deciduous B. lenta has been dominant
   for almost a century. The inclusion of healthy, intact hemlock stands in
   the design, and the close proximity of plots, allowed for a powerful
   space-for-time approach to detect ecosystem changes that are likely to
   occur across the broader landscape with HWA-induced hemlock loss in
   coming years. Three years of data collection from a series of plots in
   hemlock, young birch, and mature birch stands revealed dramatic
   differences in soil carbon pools and cycling. Between forests dominated
   by hemlock vs. mature birch, we saw a significant decrease in soil
   organic layer mass and in the C:N of the remaining organic material.
   Although hemlock and young birch stands showed no significant
   differences in soil respiration rates, mature birch stands had
   significantly higher soil respiration rates throughout the entire
   growing season, regardless of wet or dry years. Our results suggest that
   the carbon pool in the forest floor is likely to mobilize through
   greater decomposition with a 6.8x decline in soil organic layer C
   storage as hemlocks are replaced by deciduous trees, leading to a
   potential net release of similar to 4.5 tons C per hectare. We conclude
   that the ramifications of this change for carbon storage could be
   extensive, but may take decades to manifest.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in the phenology of avian taxa has long been studied to
   understand how a species reacts to environmental changes over both space
   and time. Penguins (Sphenicidae) serve as an important example of how
   biotic and abiotic factors influence certain stages of seabird phenology
   because of their large ranges and the extreme, dynamic conditions
   present in their Southern Ocean habitats. Here, we examined the
   phenology of gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) and chinstrap penguins
   (Pygoscelis antarctica) at 17 sites across the Scotia arc, including the
   first documented monitoring of phenology on the South Sandwich Islands,
   to determine which breeding phases are intrinsic, or rather vary across
   a species range and between years. We used a novel method to measure
   seabird breeding phenology and egg and chick survival: time-lapse
   cameras. Contrary to the long-standing theory that these phases are
   consistent between colonies, we found that latitude and season had a
   predominant influence on the length of the nest establishment,
   incubation, and guard durations. We observe a trend toward longer
   incubation times occurring farther south, where ambient temperatures are
   colder, which may indicate that exposure to cold slows embryo growth.
   Across species, in colonies located farther south, parents abandoned
   nests later when eggs were lost or chicks died and the latest record of
   eggs or chicks in the nest occurred earlier during the breeding period.
   The variation in both space and time observed in penguin phenology
   provides evidence that the duration of phases within the annual cycle of
   birds is not fundamental, or genetic, as previously understood.
   Additionally, the recorded phenology dates should inform field
   researchers on the best timing to count colonies at the peak of
   breeding, which is poorly understood.}},

Abstract = {{This paper offers a novel methodological approach for better
   understanding how different capital assets can be organized,

   sensitivity to climatic stresses - an area that requires greater
   research attention in the context of adaptation policy. Research was

   understudied areas of the country. This wetland-dominated ecosystem is
   home to diverse resources user groups (e.g., farmer and fisher) who are
   subjected to regular seasonal flooding, excessive rainfall, drought, and
   flash floods. Working in 12 adjacent villages of two significant
   wetlands (Hakaluki haor and Tanguar haor), qualitative and quantitative
   data were collected through 15 focus groups (n = 15), 35 key informant
   interviews, and 356 household surveys to better understand how community
   members adapt in response to their livelihood sensitivity to the
   climatic stresses. Results indicate that community members organize and

Abstract = {{Marine microbes encounter a myriad of biotic and abiotic factors that
   can impact fitness by limiting their range and capacity to move between

   bacteria that cycle between their hosts and the surrounding habitat. As
   geologic history, biogeography, and other factors such as water
   temperature, salinity, and physical barriers can inhibit bacterial
   movement to novel environments, we chose to examine the genetic
   architecture of Euprymna albatrossae (Mollusca: Cephalopoda) and their
   Vibrio fischeri symbionts in the Philippine archipelago using a combined
   phylogeographic approach. Eleven separate sites in thePhilippine islands
   were examined using haplotype estimates that were examined via nested
   clade analysis to determine the relationship between E.albatrossae and
   V.fischeri populations and their geographic location. Identical analyses
   of molecular variance (AMOVA) were used to estimate variation within and
   between populations for host and symbiont genetic data. Host animals
   demonstrated a significant amount of variation within island groups,
   while symbiont variation was found within individual populations. Nested
   clade phylogenetic analysis revealed that hosts and symbionts may have
   colonized this area at different times, with a sudden change in habitat.
   Additionally, host data indicate restricted gene flow, whereas symbionts
   show range expansion, followed by periodic restriction to genetic flow.
   These differences between host and symbiont networks indicate that

Abstract = {{Imaging techniques are a cornerstone of contemporary biology. Over the
   last decades, advances in microscale imaging techniques have allowed
   fascinating new insights into cell and tissue morphology and internal
   anatomy of organisms across kingdoms. However, most studies so far
   provided snapshots of given reference taxa, describing organs and
   tissues under idealized conditions. Surprisingly, there is an almost
   complete lack of studies investigating how an organisms internal
   morphology changes in response to environmental drivers. Consequently,
   ecology as a scientific discipline has so far almost neglected the
   possibilities arising from modern microscale imaging techniques. Here,
   we provide an overview of recent developments of X-ray computed
   tomography as an affordable, simple method of high spatial resolution,
   allowing insights into three-dimensional anatomy both in vivo and ex
   vivo. We review ecological studies using this technique to investigate
   the three-dimensional internal structure of organisms. In addition, we
   provide practical comparisons between different preparation techniques
   for maximum contrast and tissue differentiation. In particular, we
   consider the novel modality of phase contrast by self-interference of
   the X-ray wave behind an object (i.e., phase contrast by free space
   propagation). Using the cricket Acheta domesticus (L.) as model
   organism, we found that the combination of FAE fixative and iodine
   staining provided the best results across different tissues. The drying
   technique also affected contrast and prevented artifacts in specific
   cases. Overall, we found that for the interests of ecological studies,
   X-ray computed tomography is useful when the tissue or structure of
   interest has sufficient contrast that allows for an automatic or
   semiautomatic segmentation. In particular, we show that reconstruction
   schemes which exploit phase contrast can yield enhanced image quality.
   Combined with suitable specimen preparation and automated analysis,
   X-ray CT can therefore become a promising quantitative 3D imaging
   technique to study organisms responses to environmental drivers, in both
   ecology and evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive high-severity fires are creating large shrubfields in many dry
   conifer forests of the interior western USA, raising concerns about
   forest-to-shrub conversion. This study evaluates the role of disturbance
   in shrubfield formation, maintenance and succession in the Jemez
   Mountains, New Mexico. We compared the environmental conditions of
   extant Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) shrubfields with adjoining dry
   conifer forests and used dendroecological methods to determine the
   multi-century fire history and successional dynamics of five of the
   largest shrubfields (76-340 ha). Across the study area, 349 shrubfields
   (5-368 ha) occur in similar topographic and climate settings as dry
   conifer forests. This suggests disturbance, rather than other
   biophysical factors, may explain their origins and persistence. Gambel
   oak ages and tree-ring fire scars in our sampled shrubfields indicate
   they historically (1664-1899) burned concurrently with adjoining conifer
   forests and have persisted for over 115 years in the absence of fire.
   Aerial imagery from 1935 confirmed almost no change in sampled
   shrubfield patch sizes or boundaries over the twentieth century. The
   largest shrubfield we identified is less than 4\% the size of the
   largest conifer-depleted and substantially shrub-dominated area recently

Abstract = {{1. The impact of sea level rise (SLR) on coastal wetlands is dependent
   on the net effects of increased inundation and saltwater intrusion. The
   need for accurate projections of SLR impacts has motivated several
   experimental mesocosm studies aimed at detailed investigations on
   wetland biogeochemical cycling. However, the degree with which they
   accurately reproduce field conditions remains unknown because they have
   primarily been laboratory based using relatively small sediment volumes
   (10-200 L) treated over short time periods.
   2. As a first step towards addressing these issues, we present a novel
   mesocosm device and portable methodology for long-term SLR simulation
   via in situ saltwater additions to relatively large sediment volumes
   (approximately 1,000 L). The device (chamber) consists of two
   interlocking polycarbonate cylinders with an internal diameter of 1.4 m.
   Each cylinder has holes drilled in the side to facilitate water
   exchange. The outer cylinder (collar) can be rotated to one of two
   possible positions. The first position produces alignment of the inner
   cylinder holes with the collar holes, whereas the second position
   offsets the holes to eliminate water exchange and contain salt additions
   (doses).
   3. Our device design and dosing scheme produced higher porewater
   salinities in the sediments of treatment mesocosms relative to control
   mesocosm sediments. In addition, we observed low incidence of elevated
   porewater salinity outside of the chamber walls and no measurable salt
   contamination of control plots.
   4. Widespread SLR simulations in a variety of geographical settings,
   whether with our proposed design or some other design, would likely help
   reduce some of the general uncertainties regarding the sensitivity of
   coastal wetlands to SLR and saltwater intrusion.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic alteration is a predominant stressor for biological resources
   in streams. This stress is further aggravated by competing human and
   ecological demands for limited water resources. Understanding
   flow-ecology relationships and establishing relevant and implementable
   flow targets are essential to protect biological communities. Estimating
   degree of ecologically relevant hydrologic alteration depends on the
   availability of long-term flow data at sites with biological
   information. However, measured flow data are seldom available at
   sufficient density to support large-scale analyses of the biological
   effects of hydrologic alterations. The ability to accurately simulate
   flows and estimate flow metrics at many ungauged locations across a
   broad geographical area remains a fundamental challenge. We address this
   challenge by applying a novel technique to simulate flow regimes at any
   stream reach of interest by first developing an ensemble of regionally
   calibrated and validated hydrological models, and then using a selection
   tool to match the best-fit model to ungauged stream reaches. An ensemble
   of 26 HEC-HMS rainfall-runoff models were calibrated to represent the
   range of catchment conditions in the southern California region. We
   developed current and historical flow regimes and a suite of flow
   metrics at 572 ungauged sites in southern California with bioassessment
   monitoring data. The flow metrics represent hydrograph characteristics
   of magnitude, timing, frequency, duration and variability. The flow
   metrics were estimated under three precipitation conditionsdry, wet and
   average. In addition, we estimated aggregated flow metrics for
   (dry+wet+average) condition. Hydrologic alteration was estimated as the
   deviation between the modelled current and historical flow metrics.
   Approximately 79\% of the region shows some degree of hydrologic
   alteration, and approximately 40\% of the sites are estimated to be
   severely altered. Magnitude metrics tend to increase in response to
   urban and agricultural land uses, whereas the timing and duration
   metrics are mostly unchanged. This mechanistic modelling approach
   demonstrates the feasibility of estimating flow alterations for ungauged
   catchments with relative ease of transferability over a broad
   geographical region. The continuous granular flow data allow for
   computation and consideration of metrics that may be applicable to a
   variety of ecological endpoints and consideration of a range of
   management trade-offs.}},

Abstract = {{Living aquatic communities are largely determined and maintained by the
   volume and quality of flowing waters, both within lotic systems and in
   receiving waters of coastal systems. However, flow is one of the most
   frequently and extensively altered features of rivers and streams;
   alteration effects are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. Lotic
   systems vary and different fish species need different environmental
   conditions, and distinct problems are evident at various spatial scales.
   New synoptic flow and biological information now make it possible to
   evaluate the effects of altered flows throughout the Great Lakes Region
   at scales from the stream reach to the Region. We used estimates of
   river and streamflow and observed fish abundances to develop tools that
   specify the response of fish to alterations in those flows. We fit the
   logistic model to a cumulative fish abundance curve as a function of
   yield providing an empirical means to develop models of the response of
   cumulative fish abundance to flows. Response zones of yield for each
   species in each system type (based on size and thermal class) illustrate
   how criteria may be developed that can be used in decision-making for
   management of flows. In our example application, we evaluate both the
   general response of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) abundances (and
   fish diversity) to changes in flows and assess the sensitivity of each
   stream fish community to flow alteration. Mapping stream sensitivity to
   flow alteration throughout the US Great Lakes Region with a multiscale
   spatial framework showed how regional variability in sensitivity for any
   fish species or assemblage may be evaluated and provides managers with
   information to help determine where the best opportunities for
   protection or restoration of streamflows and associated communities
   exist. These results provide valuable tools and critical information to
   managers responsible for balancing water uses and maintaining high
   quality lotic ecosystems. These methods may be applied to any geographic
   region and can be extended nationally or globally, where flow,
   temperature, fish and landscape data are available.}},

Abstract = {{Novel flow regimes resulting from dam operations and overallocation of
   freshwater resources are an emerging consequence of global change. Yet,
   anticipating how freshwater biodiversity will respond to surging flow
   regime alteration requires overcoming two challenges in environmental
   flow science: shifting from local to riverscape-level understanding of
   biodiversity dynamics, and from static to time-varying characterizations
   of the flow regime. Here, we used time-series methods (wavelets and
   multivariate autoregressive models) to quantify flow-regime alteration
   and to link time-varying flow regimes to the dynamics of multiple local
   communities potentially connected by dispersal (i.e., a metacommunity).
   We studied the Chattahoochee River below Buford dam (Georgia, U.S.A.),
   and asked how flow regime alteration by a large hydropower dam may
   control the long-term functional trajectory of the downstream
   invertebrate metacommunity. We found that seasonal variation in
   hydropeaking synchronized temporal fluctuations in trait abundance among
   the flow-altered sites. Three biological trait states describing
   adaptation to fast flows benefitted from flow management for hydropower,
   but did not compensate for declines in 16 loser traits. Accordingly,
   metacommunity-wide functional diversity responded negatively to
   hydropeaking intensity, and stochastic simulations showed that the risk
   of functional diversity collapse within the next 4years would decrease
   by 17\% if hydropeaking was ameliorated, or by 9\% if it was applied
   every other season. Finally, an analysis of 97 reference and 23
   dam-affected river sites across the U.S. Southeast suggested that flow
   variation at extraneous, human-relevant scales (12-hr, 24-hr, 1-week) is
   relatively common in rivers affected by hydropower dams. This study
   advances the notion that novel flow regimes are widespread, and simplify
   the functional structure of riverine communities by filtering out taxa
   with nonadaptive traits and by spatially synchronizing their dynamics.
   This is relevant in the light of ongoing and future hydrologic
   alteration due to climate non-stationarity and the new wave of dams
   planned globally.}},

Abstract = {{There has been significant study of barriers to implementation of
   payment for ecosystem services in Indigenous communities in less
   developed countries. These barriers include land tenure insecurity and
   lack of access to capital. However, there is no similar research in the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries.
   Our research fills this gap. We hypothesize that mismatches between the
   traditional land tenure regimes and institutional arrangements of
   Indigenous communities on one hand, and government sponsors of PES
   programs on the other hand, result in the lack of success of these
   programs. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a qualitative study of
   the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) on the Hopi
   reservation in the United States. We answer two questions: (1) What
   barriers prevent Hopi ranchers and farmers from participating in
   incentive-based programs? (2) What institutional changes are necessary
   to permit Hopi farmer and rancher participation in EQIP? We analyzed
   primary documents and conducted key informant interviews. We conclude
   that land tenure is at the forefront of problems associated with
   administering PES programs in Indigenous communities. Without new
   approaches addressing the land tenure regimes in Indigenous communities,
   PES will continue to struggle on American Indian reservations and around
   the world.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of the PHAILIN, HUDHUD cyclones in the Bay of Bengal

   disastrous effects on the ever-increasing coastal population as well as
   the natural resources that are available in these regions. In this
   paper, the coastal vulnerability of a part of the Odisha coast,
   including the districts of Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur, has been
   assessed on a relatively finer scale. These districts are reported to be
   the most vulnerable areas along the Odisha coast. A set of
   Physical-geological parameters and socio-economic factors are used to
   derive the vulnerability using AHP, and vulnerability maps are prepared
   to demarcate areas with different vulnerability. The Coastal
   Vulnerability Index (CVI) finally is grouped into the three
   vulnerability classes for the final coastal vulnerability map. Depending
   on this classification, approx. 35\% of the coastline comes under high
   vulnerability, 39\% under Medium and 26\% under low vulnerability class.
   The coastline adjoining, Teisimouza, Barunei, Paradip, are the highly

Abstract = {{Stable isotope ratios of H and O are widely used to identify the source
   of water, e.g., in aquifers, river runoff, soils, plant xylem, and
   plant-based beverages. In situations where the sampled water is
   partially evaporated, its isotope values will have evolved along an
   evaporation line (EL) in delta H-2/delta O-18 space, and back-correction
   along the EL to its intersection with a meteoric water line (MWL) has
   been used to estimate the source water's isotope ratios. Here, we review
   the theory underlying isotopic estimation of source water for evaporated
   samples (iSW(E)). We note potential for bias from a commonly used
   regression-based approach for EL slope estimation and suggest that a
   model-based approach may be preferable if assumptions of the regression
   approach are not valid. We then introduce a mathematical framework that
   eliminates the need to explicitly estimate the EL-MWL intersection,
   simplifying iSW(E) analysis and facilitating more rigorous uncertainty
   estimation. We apply this approach to data from the US EPA's 2007
   National Lakes Assessment. We find that data for most lakes are
   consistent with a water source similar to annual runoff, estimated from
   monthly precipitation and evaporation within the lake basin. Strong
   evidence for both summer- and winter-biased sources exists, however,
   with winter bias pervasive in most snow-prone regions. The new
   analytical framework should improve the rigor of iSW(E) in ecohydrology
   and related sciences, and our initial results from US lakes suggest that
   previous interpretations of lakes as unbiased isotope integrators may
   only be valid in certain climate regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Frequent occurrences of drought events can lead to winter wheat drought
   disasters. To prevent drought damage and reduce potential losses, it is
   important to establish an index to provide support for winter wheat
   drought monitoring, prevention, and mitigation, and further to
   understand the precise spatiotemporal characteristics of winter wheat
   droughts. In this study, meteorological factors, remote sensing
   products, disaster records, and phenophases of winter wheat in the
   Huang-Huai-Hai Plain were integrated to establish a Crop Drought
   Identification Index for winter wheat drought disasters. The CDII was
   expressed as the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and crop
   evapotranspiration under standard conditions (ELc), in which ETa was
   simulated through the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model and ETc was
   calculated based on the Penman-Monteith method using daily
   meteorological data and MODIS remotely sensed products. The CDII for
   winter wheat at different developmental stages was formed by
   establishing the drought sample sequences and determining the thresholds
   based on a Lilliefors goodness-of-fit test and the upper threshold of a
   95\% confidence interval. Validation showed that the identification
   results by CDII corresponded with 86.2\% drought records. The spatial
   distributions of drought characteristics for winter wheat in the
   Huang-Huai-Hai Plain were mapped. The thresholds of the CDII at the
   before wintering stage, returning green-jointing stage, and heading
   stage were higher than that at the other two developmental stages.
   Drought frequency was higher across the whole Huang Huai-Hai Plain at
   the before wintering stage and returning green-jointing stage of winter
   wheat. The regions with higher drought frequency were concentrated in
   the northern part of the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain at the heading stage and
   in the mid-western Shandong Province at the milky ripening physiological
   maturity stage. This study took the drought distribution in the
   2006-2007 growing season and heading stages from 2000 to 2013 as
   examples, the results indicated that the CDII could identify the actual
   drought of winter wheat reasonably. The findings indicate the CDII is
   useful for monitoring and assessing winter wheat drought disasters at a

Abstract = {{Archaea are ubiquitous in terrestrial and marine environments and play
   an important role in biogeochemical cycles. Although air acts as the
   primary medium for their dispersal among different habitats, their
   diversity and abundance is not well characterized. The main reason for
   this lack of insight is that archaea are difficult to culture, seem to
   be low in number in the atmosphere, and have so far been difficult to
   detect even with molecular genetic approaches. However, to better
   understand the transport, residence time, and living conditions of
   microorganisms in the atmosphere as well as their effects on the
   atmosphere and vice versa, it is essential to study all groups of
   bioaerosols. Here we present an in-depth analysis of airborne archaea
   based on Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from atmospheric coarse
   and fine particulate matter samples and show seasonal dynamics and
   discuss anthropogenic influences on the diversity, composition, and
   abundance of airborne archaea.
   The relative proportions of archaea to bacteria, the differences of the
   community composition in fine and coarse particulate matter, and the
   high abundance in coarse matter of one typical soil related family, the
   Nitrososphaeraceae, point to local phyllosphere and soil habitats as
   primary emission sources of airborne archaea.
   We found comparable seasonal dynamics for the dominating Euryarchaeota
   classes and Crenarchaeota orders peaking in summer and fall. In
   contrast, the omnipresent Cenarchaeales and the Thermoplasmata occur
   only throughout summer and fall. We also gained novel insights into
   archaeal composition in fine particulate matter (< 3 mu m), with
   Cenarchaeaceae, Nitrososphaeraceae, Methanosarcinales, Thermoplasmata,
   and the genus Nitrosopumilus as the dominating taxa.
   The seasonal dynamics of methanogenic Euryarchaeota point to
   anthropogenic activities, such as fertilization of agricultural fields
   with biogas substrates or manure, as sources of airborne archaea. This
   study gains a deeper insight into the abundance and composition of
   archaea in the atmosphere, especially within the fine particle mode,
   which adds to a better understanding of the overall atmospheric

   variability are predictive of climate change response, understanding the
   scope and nature of plasticity is an important step toward answering
   these questions. One advantage of the biologging approach is that it can
   facilitate the measurement of traits at the level of the individual,
   permitting research that investigates the degree to which physiology and
   behavior are plastic. As such, combining biologging withmetrics of
   fitness can provide insight into how plasticity might confer population
   and species resilience to climate change. Increased use of biologgers in
   experimental manipulations will also yield important insight into how
   phenotypic flexibility allows some animals to mitigate the negative
   consequences of climate change. Although biologging studies to date have
   mostly functioned inmeasuring phenotypic responses to short-termclimate
   variability, we argue that integrating biologging technology into
   long-term monitoring programs will be instrumental in documenting and
   understanding ecological responses to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The New Jersey Bureau of Freshwater and Biological Monitoring (BFBM) has
   been conducting Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) monitoring on
   rivers and streams (with drainage area > 12.95 km(2)) in the Northern
   part of the state since 2000 using Karr's original IBI format with
   several regional modifications. In an effort to increase the overall
   performance of the IBI and to assess smaller headwater streams, a new
   design and approach to metric development was evaluated on approximately
   230 high gradient streams. This design, developed by Thomas Whittier and
   Robert Hughes, has been implemented for numerous Western U.S. studies,
   as well as the Connecticut multi-metric indices (MMI). Analysis resulted
   in two distinct stream classes; a coldwater community (Headwaters IBI)
   with drainage area < 10.36 km(2) consisting of brook trout, sensitive
   salamanders, and native crayfish and cool/warmwater fish communities
   (Northern FIBI) with drainage area > 10.36 km(2). Over 140 metrics from
   ten ecological classes were tested for signal to noise, range,
   responsiveness, and redundancy. A total of eight metrics representing
   seven ecological classes were selected for the Northern FIBI and six
   metrics representing five ecological classes were selected for the
   Headwaters IBI. These two indices provide the Bureau with an effective
   and sensitive biological tool to monitor and assess all non-tidal,
   wadeable streams in the Piedmont, Highlands, and Ridge and Valley
   physiographic ecoregions.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Climate, by altering the spatio-temporal distributions of suitable
   habitats, leads to modifications in a multitude of species ranges. In
   recent years, the ability of species to adjust to changing climatic
   conditions is of growing concern. In the present study, a generic
   trait-based method to assess species exploratory potential under climate
   change is proposed. ``Exploratory potential{''} is here defined as the
   capacity of species to initiate the act of leaving their current
   habitats and to reach new ones outside of their range, at a rate fast
   enough to keep pace with climate change. The presented method is based
   on the calculation of the Exploratory Potential Index (EPI), a metric
   that combines several life-history traits into a single numeric value.
   Both coefficients and variables of this composite metric are flexible.
   They depend on the set of species under consideration through a two-step
   participatory expert-based procedure. A panel of experts on the species'
   biology, ecology and conservation is first to be constituted. Then,
   experts are separately consulted to validate the variables to be
   integrated in the composite EPI index and are asked to rank the
   importance of these variables relative to each other following an
   Analytic Hierarchy Process. Coefficients in the EPI index and scores are
   given a credibility distribution using a Bayesian inference model.
   Anadromous species are chosen as a first application case. Scripts and
   raw survey data are made available to readers to ease applications to
   other species groups.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsHow do changes in grazing intensity by different herbivores and
   differences in forest structure affect the assembly of ecological
   clusters within plant ecological networks in dryland plant communities?
   LocationEastern Australia across an area of 0.4million km(2).
   MethodsWe used correlation network analysis and structural equation
   modelling to examine how changes in grazing intensity, by different
   herbivores, and differences in forest structure (tree canopy cover,
   basal area and density) and soil fertility influenced the assembly of
   ecological clusters of plant communities (i.e. relative abundance of
   ecological clusters formed by co-occurring plant species within an
   ecological network) in three forested communities from eastern
   Australia.
   ResultsLivestock grazing and forest structure regulated the relative
   abundance of ecological clusters within plant networks, but their
   effects on these plant assemblies were highly dependent on the
   ecological cluster and forest community type, with no single winner or
   loser across forest types, conditions or grazing intensities. Thus, the
   relative abundance of some ecological clusters increased under grazing
   while others declined, a response that was maintained across different
   forest structures. The relative importance of grazing, forest structure
   and soil fertility varied across forest community type. The two eucalypt
   communities exhibited mixed effects of grazing and forest structure
   (Eucalyptus largiflorens) or forest structure only (Eucalyptus
   camaldulensis). In the third (Callitris glaucophylla) community, grazing
   played a larger role in controlling the plant community assembly. Soil
   fertility (soil C and P) effects were of a similar magnitude to grazing
   and forest structure, but the effects differed among clusters.
   ConclusionsLivestock grazing and forest structure regulated the relative
   abundance of ecological clusters within networks of plant communities in
   forests in eastern Australia. Our study uses a novel approach of
   ecological clusters to show that differences in grazing and forest
   structure will always disadvantage some plant ecological clusters.
   Furthermore, changes in one cluster will ultimately affect other
   clusters. Any changes in management therefore will have varied effects
   on different ecological plant clusters.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological integration refers to the fact that different phenotypic
   traits of organisms are not fully independent from each other, and tend
   to covary to different degrees. The covariation among traits is thought
   to reflect properties of the species' genetic architecture and thus can
   have an impact on evolutionary responses. Furthermore, if morphological
   integration changes along the history of a group, inferences of past
   selection regimes might be problematic. Here, we evaluated the stability
   and evolution of the morphological integration of skull traits in
   Carnivora by using evolutionary simulations and phylogenetic comparative
   methods. Our results show that carnivoran species are able to respond to
   natural selection in a very similar way. Our comparative analyses show
   that the phylogenetic signal for pattern of integration is lower than
   that observed for morphology (trait averages), and that integration was
   stable throughout the evolution of the group. That notwithstanding,
   Canidae differed from other families by having higher integration,
   evolvability, flexibility, and allometric coefficients on the facial
   region. These changes might have allowed canids to rapidly adapt to
   different food sources, helping to explain not only the phenotypic
   diversification of the family, but also why humans were able to generate
   such a great diversity of dog breeds through artificial selection.}},

   a new measure of dissimilarity and level of significance to giant panda
   Ailuropoda melanoleuca}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used for predicting
   species spatial distributions. Different model setup and data input
   however can lead to variable model predictions. Existing studies on
   quantifying SDM dissimilarity primarily rely on partitioning the
   variability in SDM-produced community level metrics such as species
   richness and turnover rate which are threshold-dependent and are
   generated with binary range maps of multiple species. Most existing
   measurements of spatial dissimilarity constitute geometric comparisons,
   which is limited compared to a more information-theoretic application of
   statistical dissimilarity measures using SDM predictions as direct input
   without renormalization. We introduce a novel method to quantify the
   degree of dissimilarity and its level of significance between unscaled
   SDM predictions of a single species. We apply the method to giant panda
   Ailuropoda melanoleuca data as well as pairs of simulated species
   distributions. We utilize a pixel-based Bhattacharyya distance to
   quantify the degree of dissimilarity among predictions of giant panda
   habitat of different combinations of model types, Global Climate Models
   (GCMs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Comparisons are
   also made between pairs of simulated species with different degrees of
   dissimilarity in spatial distribution. To evaluate the level of
   significance, the observed dissimilarity measure is compared against a
   null distribution that captures the level of dissimilarity caused by
   small and random variations. Specific pairs of climate scenarios
   (HadGEM2-ES with HadGEM2-AO and HadGEM2-AO with MIROC5) consistently
   produce statistically similar predictions of giant panda habitat; the
   highest level of RCP tends to result in more similar predictions,
   suggesting a convergence of model predictions. The simulated scenarios
   also show that the proposed method is able to effectively differentiate
   a range of artificial species with varying degree of dissimilarity in
   their resource selection preference. Our method can also reflect the
   dissimilarity that cannot be quantified by traditional metrics that rely
   on geometric comparisons. The proposed method supplements existing
   studies by utilizing a novel application of statistical comparisons to
   measure dissimilarity between user-defined pairs of models. It provides
   a robust way to construct the null distribution of dissimilarity that
   contrasts the degree of the observed dissimilarity with the intrinsic
   model variability. Our study provides useful insight to facilitate
   building more computationally efficient and robust ensemble SDMs, and it
   lends a practical tool to help understand the processes that contribute
   to prediction variability among SDMs.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: At continental scales, abiotic factors such as climate are
   typically used to explain differences in plant ranges. Although biotic
   interactions also underlie the biogeography of plants, the importance of
   plant-associated microbes is often overlooked when predicting ranges. In
   particular, symbiotic microbes may influence the distribution of plants
   that engage in strong interactions with them. We tested whether seedling
   response to inoculation by ectomycorrhizal fungi explains range size of
   trees. To examine mechanisms underlying the relationship between range
   size and response to inoculation, we also examined to what extent
   sympatry between host and fungi influenced this relationship.
   Location: Global.
   Time period: Contemporary.
   Major taxa studied: Trees and fungi forming ectomycorrhizas.
   Methods: Using a dataset of 1,275 observations from 126 papers, we
   calculated mean biomass response (effect size) of 59 tree species to
   fungal inoculation. We extracted host range area from digitized maps of
   native distributions, and determined whether hosts were naturally
   sympatric with fungal species used as inoculum by searching herbaria
   databases with geospatially referenced data.
   Results: Tree species with seedling effect sizes falling above or below
   the average response tended to have small ranges and those with average
   responses, large ranges. Moreover, hosts inoculated with fungi whose
   ranges were allopatric to their own had higher biomass compared to those
   that were inoculated by sympatric fungi, suggesting that the extent of
   geographical overlap between trees and symbiotic fungi may attenuate the
   mutualism.
   Main conclusions: We demonstrate that mycorrhizas may underlie host
   biogeographical patterns at the continental scale. Our study is novel in
   the scope of species and scale tested, and points to a possible
   mechanism underlying this pattern related to the process of mutualism
   breakdown accruing over time at local geographical scales. For
   ectomycorrhizal tree species, performance may increase when exposed to
   fungal partners without a recent shared evolutionary history.}},

Abstract = {{The phylogenetic and population genetic structure of symbiotic
   microorganisms may correlate with important ecological traits that can
   be difficult to directly measure, such as host preferences or dispersal

   restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) protocol to reveal
   among- and within-species genetic structure for Lophodermium, a genus of
   fungal endophytes whose evolutionary analyses have been limited by the
   scarcity of informative markers. The protocol avoids expensive barcoded
   adapters and incorporates universal indexes for multiplexing. We tested
   for reproducibility and functionality by comparing shared loci from
   sample replicates and assessed the effects of numbers of ambiguous sites
   and clustering thresholds on coverage depths, number of shared loci
   among samples, and phylogenetic reconstruction. Errors between technical
   replicates were minimal. Relaxing the quality-filtering criteria
   increased the mean coverage depth per locus and the number of loci
   recovered within a sample, but had little effect on the number of shared
   loci across samples. Increasing clustering threshold decreased the mean
   coverage depth per cluster and increased the number of loci recovered
   within a sample but also decreased the number of shared loci across
   samples, especially among distantly related species. The combination of
   low similarity clustering (70\%) and relaxed quality-filtering (allowing
   up to 30 ambiguous sites per read) performed the best in phylogenetic
   analyses at both recent and deep genetic divergences. Hence, this method
   generated sufficient number of shared homologous loci to investigate the
   evolutionary relationships among divergent fungal lineages with small

Abstract = {{Forest canopies and tree crown structures are of high ecological
   importance. Measuring canopies and crowns by direct inventory methods is
   time-consuming and of limited accuracy. High-resolution inventory tools,
   in particular terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), is able to overcome
   these limitations and obtain three-dimensional (3D) structural
   information about the canopy with a very high level of detail. The main
   objective of this study was to introduce a novel method to analyze
   spatiotemporal dynamics in canopy occupancy at the individual tree and
   local neighborhood level using high-resolution 3D TLS data. For the
   analyses, a voxel grid approach was applied. The tree crowns were
   modeled through the combination of two approaches: the encasement of all
   crown points with a 3D -shape, which was then converted into a voxel
   grid, and the direct voxelization of the crown points. We show that
   canopy occupancy at individual tree level can be quantified as the crown
   volume occupied only by the respective tree or shared with neighboring
   trees. At the local neighborhood level, our method enables the precise
   determination of the extent of canopy space filling, the identification
   of tree-tree interactions, and the analysis of complementary space use.
   Using multitemporal TLS data recordings, this method allows the precise
   detection and quantification of changes in canopy occupancy through
   time. The method is applicable to a wide range of investigations in
   forest ecology research, including the study of tree diversity effects
   on forest productivity or growing space analyses for optimal tree
   growth. Due to the high accuracy of this novel method, it facilitates
   the precise analyses even of highly plastic individual tree crowns and,
   thus, the realistic representation of forest canopies. Moreover, our
   voxel grid framework is flexible enough to allow for the inclusion of
   further biotic and abiotic variables relevant to complex analyses of
   forest canopy dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Reestablishing foundational plant species through aerial seeding is an
   essential yet challenging step for restoring the vast semiarid
   landscapes impacted by plant invasions and wildfire-regime shifts. A key
   component of the challenge stems from landscape variability and its
   effects on plant recovery.
   We assessed landscape correlates, thresholds, and tipping points for
   sagebrush presence from fine-scale sampling across a large,
   heterogeneous area burned the previous year, where we were able to
   quantify soil surface features that are typically occluded yet can
   strongly affect recovery patterns.
   Hypothesis testing and binary-decision trees were used to evaluate
   factors affecting initial sagebrush establishment, using 2171 field
   plots (totaling similar to 2,000,000 m(2) sampled) over a 113,000-ha
   region.
   Sagebrush established in 50\% of plots where it was seeded, a > 12-fold
   greater establishment frequency than in unseeded areas. Sagebrush
   establishment was enhanced in threshold-like ways by elevation (> 1200 m
   ASL), topographic features that alter heatload and soil water, and by
   soil-surface features such as ``fertile islands{''} that bore the
   imprint of pre-fire sagebrush. Sagebrush occupancy had a negative,
   linear relationship with exotic-annual grass cover and parabolic
   relationship with perennial bunchgrasses (optimal at 40\% cover).
   Our approach revealed interactive, ecological relationships such as
   novel soil-surface effects on first year establishment of sagebrush
   across the burned landscape, and identified ``hot spots{''} for
   recovery. The approach could be expanded across sites and years to
   provide the information needed to explain past seeding successes or

Abstract = {{Precipitation is one of many aspects of our changing climate that is
   under investigation by the scientific community. Although climate
   scientists generally predict that the amount of precipitation has and
   will continue to increase for the United States, the characteristics of
   that changing precipitation are not well understood. Some have reported
   significant observed and projected changes in precipitation
   characteristics, but existing studies have not adequately addressed this
   issue. The precipitation characteristics particularly vulnerable to
   change are energy, intensity, duration, and frequency, which are
   responsible for causing changes in the erosivity of rainfall.
   Furthermore, there are published discrepancies in observed erosivity.
   Hence, the goal of this study was to update the erosion indices (EI),
   specifically those in the southeastern United States, for two reasons.
   First, it is a region highly likely to be influenced by climate change
   and climate variability, and second, it is the setting of published
   discrepancies mentioned above. Observed quarter-hour precipitation data
   from 616 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National
   Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) land-based stations
   (DSI-3260) for 11 states in the Southeast were used to calculate EI
   values for each station. The data were screened (to reduce gaps in the
   data) before calculation, resulting in 172 gauge locations to represent
   the 11 states. A water balance was performed to validate the observed
   data set and to select the best of seven station screening methods.
   Annual and single-storm EI statistics were calculated for stations
   passing the preferred screening method using 15-minute precipitation
   data. Since fixed-interval data slightly underestimate the maximum
   30-minute intensity of a storm, an adjustment to annual EI calculations
   was suggested to account for this underestimation. Annual EI estimations
   for the Southeast were found to be significantly larger than Wischmeier
   and Smith (1978) and Renard et al. (1997), confirming the findings of
   McGregor et al. (1995) while significantly increasing the spatial
   resolution of EI observations in the Southeast. The regional increase on
   average was 18.6\% over previous EI values from Renard et al. (1997),
   with a range of -19.5\% to +57.5\%. There was no consistent significant
   change in the single-storm EI for the study area, with an average
   decrease of 2.3\% for the 10-year storm EI, although regional results
   varied. A comparison of the 10-year storm EI showed significant changes
   in some inland areas mostly arising from an unorthodox contouring method
   used in Renard et al. (1997), which was also pointed out by Hollinger et
   al. (2002). Also, the Atlantic Coast may have experienced lower
   single-storm EI for the period observed due to a negative phase of the
   Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) compared to observations during
   a strong-positive AMO phase for previous EI estimations. This study
   presents a novel, simplified methodology for estimating EI from more
   reliable precipitation data as well as a benchmark for climate impact
   studies related to erosivity for conservation efforts in the Southeast.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of anthropogenic global environmental change on biotic and
   abiotic processes have been reported in aquatic systems across the
   world. Complex synergies between concurrent environmental stressors and
   the resilience of the system to regime shifts, which vary in space and
   time, determine the capacity for marine systems to maintain structure
   and function with global environmental change. Consequently, an
   interdisciplinary approach that facilitates the development of new
   methods for the exchange of knowledge between scientists across multiple
   scales is required to effectively understand, quantify and predict
   climate impacts on marine ecosystem services. We use a literature review
   to assess the limitations and assumptions of current pathways to
   exchange interdisciplinary knowledge and the transferability of research
   findings across spatial and temporal scales and levels of biological
   organization to advance scientific understanding of global environmental
   change in marine systems. We found that species-specific regional scale
   climate change research is most commonly published, and supporting is
   the ecosystem service most commonly referred to in publications. In
   addition, our paper outlines a trajectory for the future development of
   integrated climate change science for sustaining marine ecosystem
   services such as investment in interdisciplinary education and
   connectivity between disciplines.}},

Abstract = {{Association studies of polygenic traits are notoriously difficult when
   those studies are conducted at large geographic scales. The difficulty
   arises as genotype frequencies often vary in geographic space and across
   distinct environments. Those large-scale variations are known to yield
   false positives in standard association testing approaches. Although
   several methods alleviate this problem, no tools have been proposed to
   evaluate the power that association tests could achieve for a specific
   study design and set of genotypes. Our goal here is to present an R
   program fulfilling this objective, by allowing users to simulate
   phenotypes from observed genotypes and to estimate upper bounds on
   achievable power. The simulation model can incorporate realistic
   features such as population structure and gene-by-environment
   interactions, and the package implements a gold-standard test that
   evaluates power using information on confounders. We illustrated the use
   of the program with example studies based on data for the plant species
   Arabidopsis thaliana. Simulated phenotypes were used to compare the
   ability of two recent association methods to correctly remove
   confounding factors, to evaluate power to detect causal variants, and to
   assess the influence various parameters. For the simulated data, the new
   tests reached performances close to the gold-standard test and could be
   reasonably used with measured phenotypes. Power to detect causal
   variants was influenced by the number of variants and by the strength of
   their effect sizes, and specific thresholds were obtained from the
   simulation study. In conclusion, our program provides guidance on
   methodological choice of association tests, as well as useful knowledge
   on test performances in a user-specific context.}},

Abstract = {{The adaptation to a new habitat often results in a confounding between
   genomewide genotype and beneficial alleles. When the confounding is
   strong, or the allelic effects is weak, it is a major statistical
   challenge to detect the adaptive polymorphisms. We describe a novel
   approach to dissect polygenic traits in natural populations. First,
   candidate adaptive loci are identified by screening for loci directly
   associated with the adaptive trait or the expression of genes known to
   affect it. Then, a multilocus genetic architecture is inferred using a
   backward elimination association analysis across all candidate loci with
   an adaptive false discovery rate-based threshold. Effects of population
   stratification are controlled by accounting for genomic kinship in both
   steps of the analysis and also by simultaneously testing all candidate
   loci in the multilocus model. We illustrate the method by exploring the
   polygenic basis of an important adaptive trait, flowering time in
   Arabidopsis thaliana, using public data from the 1,001 genomes project.
   We revealed associations between 33 (29) loci and flowering time at 10
   (16)degrees C in this collection of natural accessions, where standard
   genomewide association analysis methods detected five (3) loci. The 33
   (29) loci explained approximately 55.1 (48.7)\% of the total phenotypic
   variance of the respective traits. Our work illustrates how the genetic
   basis of highly polygenic adaptive traits in natural populations can be
   explored in much greater detail using new multilocus mapping approaches
   taking advantage of prior biological information, genome and
   transcriptome data.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The Baltic Sea forms a unique regional sea with its salinity
   gradient ranging from marine to nearly freshwater conditions. It is one
   of the most environmentally impacted brackish seas worldwide, and the
   low biodiversity makes it particularly sensitive to anthropogenic
   pressures including climate change. We applied a novel combination of
   models to predict the fate of one of the dominant foundation species in
   the Baltic Sea, the bladder wrack Fucus vesiculosus.
   Location: The Baltic Sea.
   Methods: We used a species distribution model to predict climate
   change-induced displacement of F.vesiculosus and combined these
   projections with a biophysical model of dispersal and connectivity to
   explore whether the dispersal rate of locally adapted genotypes may
   match estimated climate velocities to recolonize the receding salinity
   gradient. In addition, we used a population dynamic model to assess
   possible effects of habitat fragmentation.
   Results: The species distribution model showed that the habitat of
   F.vesiculosus is expected to dramatically shrink, mainly caused by the
   predicted reduction of salinity. In addition, the dispersal rate of
   locally adapted genotypes may not keep pace with estimated climate
   velocities rendering the recolonization of the receding salinity
   gradient more difficult. A simplistic model of population dynamics also
   indicated that the risk of local extinction may increase due to future
   habitat fragmentation.
   Main conclusions: Results point to a significant risk of locally adapted
   genotypes being unable to shift their ranges sufficiently fast
   considering the restricted dispersal and long generation time. The worst
   scenario is that F.vesiculosus may disappear from large parts of the
   Baltic Sea before the end of this century with large effects on the
   biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We finally discuss how to reduce
   this risk through conservation actions, including assisted colonization
   and assisted evolution.}},

Journal = {{DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{906-918}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Climate change affects forest functioning not only through direct
   physiological effects such as modifying photosynthesis and growing
   season lengths, but also through indirect effects on community
   composition related to species extinctions and colonizations. Such
   indirect effects remain poorly explored in comparison with the direct
   ones. Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) studies commonly examine
   the effects of species loss by eliminating species randomly. However,
   species extinctions caused by climate change will depend on the species'
   vulnerability to the new environmental conditions, thus occurring in a
   specific, non-random order. Here, we evaluated whether successive tree
   species extinctions, according to their vulnerability to climate change,
   impact forest functions differently than random species losses.
   Location: Eleven temperate forests across a gradient of climatic
   conditions in central Europe.
   Methods: We simulated tree community dynamics with a forest succession
   model to study the impact of species loss on the communities'
   aboveground biomass, productivity and temporal stability. Tree species
   were removed from the local pool (1) randomly, and according to (2)
   their inability to be recruited under a warmer climate or (3) their
   increased mortality under drier conditions.
   Results: Results showed that non-random species loss (i.e., based on
   their vulnerability to warmer or drier conditions) changed forest
   functioning at a different rate, and sometimes direction, than random
   species loss. Furthermore, directed extinctions, unlike random,
   triggered tipping points along the species loss process where forest
   functions were strongly impacted. These tipping points occurred after
   fewer extinctions in forests located in the coldest areas, where
   ecosystem functioning relies on fewer species.
   Main conclusions: We showed that the extinction of species in a
   deterministic and mechanistically motivated order, in this case the
   species vulnerability to climate change, strengthens the selection
   effect of diversity on ecosystem functioning. BEF studies exploring the
   impact of species loss on ecosystem functioning using random extinctions
   thus possibly underestimate the potential effect of biodiversity loss
   when driven by a directional force, such as climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Saltmarshes are recognised worldwide to be among the most complex
   ecosystems, where several environmental factors concur to sustain their
   fragile functioning. Among them, soil-plant interactions are pivotal but
   often overlooked. The aim of this work was to use a structural equation
   modelling (SEM) approach to get new insight into soil-plant
   interactions, focusing on the effect of plant traits and abundance on
   soil, and test the effect of soil and/or plants on the entire community,
   monitoring changes in plant richness. The target halophytes Limonium
   narbonense and Sarcocornia fruticosa were sampled in the Marano and
   Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea). Basal leaves of L. narbonense and
   green shoots of S. fruticosa were used to estimate plant growth, while
   the abundance of both species was used as a proxy of species
   competition. SEM was applied to test relationships between predictors
   and response variables in a single causal network. The flooding period
   (hydroperiod) negatively affected plant growth and soil properties,
   whereas plants decreased the intensity of soil reduction. Flooding did
   not directly affect species abundance or diversity, whose changes were
   instead driven by plant traits. The direct relationships between plant
   traits and species richness highlighted that species competition could
   be even more important than environmental stresses in defining plant
   diversity and zonation.}},

Abstract = {{Urban-rural fringe is the frontier of urban expansion and the most
   dynamic area in urban region. Identifying the urban-rural fringe
   accurately is of great significance, as it helps to measure the extent
   of urbanization and its environmental effects from the urban-rural
   contrast perspective. However, traditional studies with spatial discrete
   data and threshold methods make it difficult to identify its boundary
   objectively and accurately. To solve this problem, a new approach was
   proposed in this study, integrating the spatial continuous data of
   impervious surface area (ISA) and the method of spatial continuous
   wavelet transform (SCWT). Taking Beijing City, one of the largest city
   in China, as a case, this study identified the boundary of urban-rural
   fringe, which extended mainly in the southwestern and northeastern
   direction, with the area increased by 18.75\% between 2009 and 2014. The
   accuracy of the identification result was verified by spatial
   differentiation characteristics of nighttime light and normalized
   difference vegetation index. Meanwhile, when compared with the
   subjective threshold method, it showed that SCWT could identify the
   fringe more accurately. And the ISA based identification result was more
   consistent with the actual spatial patterns of urban development in
   Beijing City than land use degree index based one, which showed the
   remotely sensed spatial continuous data performed more effectively well
   on identifying the urban-rural fringe. The proposed approach can
   identify the urban-rural fringe directly from remote sensing images,
   which is of great significance to quickly urbanization monitoring and
   thus sustainable urban planning and management.}},

Abstract = {{The feedback between planetary warming and soil carbon loss has been the
   focus of considerable scientific attention in recent decades, due to its
   potential to accelerate anthropogenic climate change. The soil carbon
   temperature sensitivity is traditionally estimated from short-term
   respiration measurements - either from laboratory incubations that are
   artificially manipulated or from field measurements that cannot
   distinguish between plant and microbial respiration. To address these
   limitations of previous approaches, we developed a new method to
   estimate soil temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of soil carbon directly
   from warming-induced changes in soil carbon stocks measured in 36 field
   experiments across the world. Variations in warming magnitude and
   control organic carbon percentage explained much of field-warmed organic
   carbon percentage (R-2 = 0.96), revealing Q(10) across sites of 2.2
   {[}1.6, 2.7] 95\% confidence interval (CI). When these field-derived
   Q(10) values were extrapolated over the 21st century using a post hoc
   correction of 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)
   Earth system model outputs, the multi-model mean soil carbon stock
   changes shifted from the previous value of 88 +/- 153 Pg carbon
   (weighted mean +/- 1 SD) to 19 +/- 155 Pg carbon with a Q(10)-driven
   95\% CI of 248 +/- 191 to 95 +/- 209 Pg carbon. On average,
   incorporating the field-derived Q(10) values into Earth system model
   simulations led to reductions in the projected amount of carbon
   sequestered in the soil over the 21st century. However, the considerable
   parameter uncertainty led to extremely high variability in soil carbon
   stock projections within each model; intra-model uncertainty driven by
   the field-derived Q(10) was as great as that between model variation.
   This study demonstrates that data integration should capture the
   variation of the system, as well as mean trends.}},

Abstract = {{1. Few facets of biology vary more than functional traits and

   research agendas of functional ecology and population ecology.
   3. This special feature, which spans three journals of the British
   Ecological Society due to its interdisciplinary nature, showcases
   state-of-the-art research applying trait-based and demographic
   approaches to examine relationships between organismal function, life
   history strategies and population performance across multiple kingdoms.
   Examples include the exploration of how functional trait x environment
   interactions affect vital rates and thus explain population trends and
   species occurrence; the coordination of seed traits and dispersal
   ability with the pace of life in plants; the incorporation of functional
   traits in dynamic energy budget models; or the discovery of linkages

   We highlight promising, complementary research avenues to overcome

   gradients in the context of functional trait-vital rate relationships,
   and the implementation of standardised protocols to track changes in
   traits and vital rates over time at the same location and individuals,

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In the UK, four out of 18 bat species are listed on the EU Habitats
   Directive, including the lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus
   hipposideros), and their population status is closely monitored by
   visiting known roosts. R. hipposideros predominantly form maternity
   roosts in buildings, but roosts are impermanent features in the
   landscape and their distribution changes as bats form new roosts and
   abandon others. Locating new roosts requires intensive surveys which are
   challenging and inefficient. In this study, we provide a novel
   model-based strategy to identify potential R. hipposideros maternity
   roost sites that can be used to monitor bat populations. First, we model
   potential maternity roost habitat using record centre data on roost
   locations across Wales, Great Britain. We then constrain the area
   identified from modelling using record centre data on locations of bats
   in areas with no known roosts. We used two variable selection methods
   and three pseudo-absence data sets (random background points, random
   points in buildings and target group selection of mammal records) to
   produce six habitat suitability models. The three pseudo-absence data
   sets produced different habitat suitability maps, demonstrating the
   influence of pseudo-absence selection on species distribution models.
   The six models were combined using weighted mean average to produce an
   ensemble model that performed better than individual models and that
   indicated high levels of congruence in areas predicted to have high
   habitat suitability for maternity roosts. Our model revealed an
   extensive area (6523 km(2); 31\% of the area of Wales) containing 18,051
   buildings in suitable habitat. Using record centre data on bat activity
   outside commuting range from known roosts reduced the potential survey
   area to 133 km(2) (0.6\% of the area of Wales) and 207 buildings. Our
   modelling outputs can be used to direct volunteers and bat surveyors in

Abstract = {{1. Species monitoring using environmental DNA (eDNA) is a powerful new
   technique for natural resource scientists and the number of research
   groups employing eDNA detection is growing rapidly. However, current
   eDNA sampling technologies consist mainly of do-it-yourself solutions,
   and the lack of purpose-built sampling equipment is limiting the
   efficiency and standardization of eDNA studies.
   2. Here, we describe the first fully integrated sampling system (ANDe
   (TM)) designed by a team of molecular ecologists and engineers for
   high-throughput eDNA sample collection. It consists of a backpack
   portable pump that integrates sensor feedback, a pole extension with
   remote pump controller, custom-made filter housings in single-use
   packets for each sampling site and onboard sample storage. The system is
   optimized for sampling speed and replicability, while minimizing risk of
   contamination.
   3. We present an example pilot study designed to identify optimal ANDe
   (TM) system parameter values (i.e. pump pressure, flow rate, filter pore
   size, sample volume) in a new sampling environment. We identified a peak
   in filtration efficiency at a flow rate threshold of 1.0 L/m, and found
   that 5 mu m filters captured significantly more target eDNA than 1 mu m
   filters. Results also suggest that high filtration pressures may reduce
   eDNA retention, which implies that pressure should be standardized to
   avoid biasing detection data.
   4. Similar to the technological evolution of backpack electrofishers,
   eDNA sampling technology is in the process of transitioning from a
   nascent phase to professionally engineered research tools. Such
   innovations will be essential as eDNA monitoring becomes one of the

Title = {{How should we estimate diversity in the fossil record? Testing richness
   estimators using sampling-standardised discovery curves}},

Abstract = {{1. To infer genuine patterns of biodiversity change in the fossil
   record, we must be able to accurately estimate relative differences in
   numbers of taxa (richness) despite considerable variation in sampling
   between time intervals. Popular subsampling (=interpolation) methods aim
   to standardise diversity samples by rarefying the data to equal sample
   size or equal sample completeness (=coverage). Standardising by sample
   size is misleading because it compresses richness ratios, thereby
   flattening diversity curves. However, standardising by coverage
   reconstructs relative richness ratios with high accuracy. Asymptotic
   richness extrapolators are widely used in ecology, but rarely applied to
   fossil data. However, a recently developed parametric extrapolation
   method, TRiPS (True Richness estimation using Poisson Sampling),
   specifically aims to estimate the true richness of fossil assemblages.
   2. Here, we examine the suitability of a range of richness estimators
   (both interpolators and extrapolators) for fossil datasets, using
   simulations and a novel method for comparing the performance of richness
   estimators with empirical data. We constructed sampling-standardised
   discovery curves (SSDCs) for two datasets, each spanning 150 years of
   palaeontological research: Mesozoic dinosaurs at global scale, and
   Mesozoic-early Cenozoic tetrapods from North America. These approaches
   reveal how each richness estimator responds to both simulated best-case
   and empirical real-world accumulation of fossil occurrences.
   3. We find that extrapolators can only truly standardise diversity data
   once sampling is sufficient for richness estimates to have asymptoted.
   Below this point, directly comparing extrapolated estimates derived from
   samples of different sizes may not accurately reconstruct relative
   richness ratios. When abundance distributions are not perfectly flat and
   sampling is moderate to good, but not perfect, TRiPS does not
   extrapolate, because it overestimates binomial sampling probabilities.
   Coverage-based interpolators, by contrast, generally yield more stable
   subsampled diversity estimates, even in the face of dramatic increases
   in face-value counts of species richness. Richness estimators that
   standardise by coverage are among the best currently available methods
   for reconstructing deep-time biodiversity patterns. However, we
   recommend the use of sampling-standardised discovery curves to
   understand how biased reporting of fossil occurrences may affect
   sampling-standardised diversity estimates.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Quantitative ecospace models are a numerical approach to comparing
   the functional structure of different ecosystems on macroevolutionary
   time-scales, by quantifying the distribution of functional ecological
   traits. Ecospace modelling has historically been restricted to a
   combination of visual interpretation and quantification via metrics such
   as mean sum of ranges. We argue that comparing ecosystem function in
   this way overlooks critical information about degrees of overlap and
   redundancy, and potentially misrepresents the role of ``empty
   ecospace{''} in driving macroevolution. Fuzzy ecospace modelling (FEM)
   places conventional ecospace modelling within a fuzzy set-theoretic
   framework, wherein functional groups are learned from the dataset,
   creating models which are sensitive to overlap and the role of empty
   ecospace.
   2. Fuzzy ecospace modelling is a machine learning program which
   quantifies functional ecological similarity, and uses this information
   to classify new taxa. It creates functional groups using a Gower
   dissimilarity coefficient-based approach to the k-medoids algorithm, and
   uses fuzzy discriminant analysis to classify the taxa present in another
   ecosystem into these clusters, based on minimal Gower dissimilarity with
   a fuzzy threshold. This has the effect of quantifying the similarity
   between these ecosystems in terms of their functional groups, accounting
   for total redundancy, partial redundancy/ novelty and total novelty.
   3. By using fuzzy membership functions, FEM can classify taxa which are
   highly ecologically dissimilar (outliers with respect to all functional
   groups), taxa which are fully redundant (100\% similarity to those in a
   given functional group) and taxa in-between, which represent degrees of
   niche overlap. This can be used to compare the functional groups present
   in different ecosystems (as well as their degrees of overlap), and as a
   metric approach to comparing total ecological disparity. These results
   can be used to test models of the role of empty ecospace in
   macroevolutionary trends, or to investigate how ecosystems respond to
   global perturbations. Furthermore, it allows us to define numerically
   the concept of empty ecospace for n-dimensional datasets.
   4. A cluster-based approach to the quantification of ecospace allows for
   a numerical estimate of niche overlap, a value particularly difficult to
   quantify in fossil contexts.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{397-408}},

Abstract = {{Scientists do not know precisely how severe will be the impact of
   climate change on species. Evidence suggests that for some species,
   their future distributions might be jeopardized by local extinctions and
   drought-induced tree mortality. Thus, we require models capable of
   estimating drought tolerance across many species. We can approach this
   goal by assessing functional traits. The trait osmotic potential at full
   turgor, (O), is potentially a good drought indicator; however, few
   studies address its importance as a drought-tolerance predictor and it
   is difficult to measure in the field with accuracy. In this work, we aim
   to answer the questions: which drought traits correlate with (O)?; do
   morpho-anatomical traits correlate with (O)?; and which trees and shrubs
   are more (or less) vulnerable to drought? To achieve this aim, we
   assessed physiological and morpho-anatomical traits for 14 native
   species from New Zealand forests. We included leaf- and wood-related
   traits, (O), water potential and stomatal conductance. We examined how
   these traits correlate with (O) and sought to generate models to predict
   (O) as a function of other traits. We tested 33 different models and
   evaluated them using Akaike's information criterion. Unfortunately, none
   of the morpho-anatomical traits correlated well with (O). Instead, water
   potential correlated most strongly with (O). None of the models using
   only morpho-anatomical traits produced plausible results. The model with
   the best predictive performance incorporated the effects of both
   morpho-anatomical and physiological traits: water potential and wood
   saturated water content. Of the species analysed, and based on their (O)
   response, Lophozonia menziesii was considered the most vulnerable to
   drought stress, whereas Plagianthus regius was the least vulnerable. Our
   findings imply that it is potentially valuable to keep exploring the use
   of (O) as a drought indicator and that the effort required to measure
   some physiological traits, such as water potential, may be essential to
   consider plant drought responses and to predict (O).}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Ecological restoration is critical for recovering biodiversity and
   ecosystem services, yet designing interventions to achieve particular
   outcomes remains fraught with challenges. In the extensive regions where
   non-native species are firmly established, it is unlikely that
   historical conditions can be fully reinstated. To what degree, and how
   rapidly, can human-dominated areas be shifted via restoration into
   regimes that benefit target species, communities or processes?
   Location: We explore this question in a >20-year-old reforestation
   effort underway at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge in montane
   Hawaii. This large-scale planting of Acacia koa trees is designed to
   secure populations of globally threatened bird species by transitioning
   the site rapidly from pasture to native forest.
   Methods: We surveyed all forest birds in multiple corridors of young
   planted trees, remnant corridors of mature trees along gulches and at
   sites within mature forest. Using a Bayesian hierarchical approach, we
   identified which factors (distance from forest, habitat type and
   surrounding tree cover) had the most important influence on native and
   exotic bird abundance in the reforestation area.
   Results: We found that 90\% of native and exotic bird species responded
   quickly, occupying corridors of native trees approximately a decade
   after planting. However, native and exotic forest birds responded to
   markedly different characteristics of the reforested area. Native bird
   abundance was strongly predicted by proximity to mature forest and
   remnant corridors; conversely, exotic bird abundance was best predicted
   by overall tree cover throughout the area reforested.
   Main conclusions: Our results demonstrate that large-scale tree planting
   in corridors adjacent to mature forest can catalyse rapid recovery (both
   increased abundance and expanded distribution) of forest birds and that
   it is possible to design reforestation to benefit native species in
   novel ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to model freshwater stream habitat and species distributions

   the imperilment and legal protection of many species. The ability to
   distinguish suitable from unsuitable habitat conditions, including
   hydrologic suitability, is a key criterion for successful conservation

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{199-212}},

Abstract = {{Fire disturbance severely modifies ecosystem structure and functioning,
   and therefore predicting post-fire responses is pivotal to improve land
   management. Indicators that efficiently link post-fire recovery with a
   timely decision on landscape management can play a key role in the
   governance of fire risk. We describe a framework to evaluate post-fire
   recovery based on remotely-sensed measures of relative vegetation
   recovery, calculated from satellite NDVI time-series. Three indicators
   are proposed: the novel Cumulative Relative Recovery Index (CRRI),
   measuring the (mid-long term) extent and completeness of recovery; the
   Recovery Trend Index (RTI), measuring the steepness of the mid-term
   post-fire recovery trend; and the Half Recovery Time index (HRT), a
   measure of the short-term recovery rate. We used Random Forest (RF)
   models to predict the observed recovery patterns and ranked the
   predictive importance of several candidate explanatory factors. The
   performance of RF models ranged from good (CRRI, RTI) to moderate (HRT).
   Three sets of predictive variables consistently ranked higher: fire
   traits, landscape composition, and post-fire climatic conditions. The
   relative contribution of individual variables was different across
   recovery indicators. These results show that proposed indicators seem to
   capture different facets of the post-fire recovery process. The
   short-term recovery indicator (HRT) was linked to landscape composition
   and post-fire climate. Thus, HRT expresses the speed of initial
   recovery, related to differences in fire-response traits of vegetation
   and to climatic conditions immediately following fire. The mid-term
   recovery indicator (RTI) was mainly influenced by fire traits and
   post-fire climatic conditions. This indicator captures multiple
   interacting effects that shape the recovery process related to fire
   severity, vegetation type and post-fire conditions. Finally, the
   long-term recovery indicator (CRRI) was clearly more influenced by fire
   attributes related to severity than by vegetation type and structure or
   by post-fire climatic conditions. Overall, our results suggest that a
   combination of biotic processes (driven by plant life-history traits)
   and abiotic filters (e.g., post fire climate) determine the early
   post-fire recovery process. Conversely, the mid to long-term recovery
   response (expressing its completeness) is driven by the depletion of
   resilience capacity and by the amount of change in vegetation structure
   and functioning modulated by spatial differences in fire severity. Our
   results strongly suggest that an indicator-based approach grounded on
   satellite time-series of vegetation indices can effectively cover
   various facets of post-fire recovery. This will improve the monitoring
   and prediction of post-fire recovery dynamics, with valuable
   applications in fire hazard management and post-fire ecosystem
   restoration and monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Obtaining direct measurements to characterise ecosystem function can be
   hindered by remote or inaccessible regions. Next-generation satellite
   tags that inform increasingly sophisticated movement models, and the
   miniaturisation of animal-borne loggers, have enabled the use of animals
   as tools to collect habitat data in remote environments, such as the
   Southern Ocean. Research on the distribution, habitat use and recovery
   of Oceania's humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) has been
   constrained by the inaccessibility to their Antarctic feeding grounds
   and the limitations of technology. In this multi-disciplinary study, we
   combine innovative analytical tools to comprehensively assess the
   distribution and population structure of this marine predator throughout
   their entire migratory range. We used genotype and photo-identification
   matches and conducted a genetic mixed-stock analysis to identify the
   breeding ground origins of humpback whales migrating past the Kermadec
   Islands, New Zealand. Satellite tracking data and a state-space model
   were then used to identify the migratory paths and behaviour of 18
   whales, and to reveal their Antarctic feeding ground destinations.
   Additionally, we conducted progesterone assays and epigenetic aging to
   determine the pregnancy rate and age-profile of the population. Humpback
   whales passing the Kermadec Islands did not assign to a single breeding
   ground origin, but instead came from a range of breeding grounds
   spanning similar to 3500 km of ocean. Sampled whales ranged from calves
   to adults of up to 67 years of age, and a pregnancy rate of 57\% was
   estimated from 30 adult females. The whales migrated to the Southern
   Ocean (straight-line distances of up to 7000 km) and spanned similar to
   4500 km across their Antarctic feeding grounds. All fully tracked
   females with a dependent calf (n = 4) migrated to the Ross Sea region,
   while 70\% of adults without calves (n = 7) travelled further east to
   the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas region. By combining multiple
   research and analytical tools we obtained a comprehensive understanding
   of this wide-ranging, remote population of whales. Our results indicate
   a population recovering from exploitation,and their feeding ground
   distribution serves as an indicator of the resources available in these
   environments. The unexpected Kermadec Islands migratory bottle-neck of
   whales from several breeding grounds, variable distribution patterns by
   life history stage and high pregnancy rates will be important in
   informing conservation and management planning, and for understanding
   how this, as well as other whale populations, might respond to emerging

Abstract = {{Biomonitoring, i.e. using plant species for measuring pollution levels,
   has been previously explored in several locations using various
   protocols and organisms in the search for effective strategies and
   practices for monitoring and reducing the levels of pollution.
   Here we present a tested and functional cost-effective method of using
   the foliar accumulation of tree species to develop a system for the
   long-term monitoring of airborne heavy metal bioaccumulation at a large,
   national scale. A total number of 1230 leaf samples have been collected
   during a vegetation season in 410 sampling locations scattered across
   Romania. Concentration levels were determined using an inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Data from literature were used as
   reference values for the natural concentration of heavy metals in
   plants. Values exceeding these levels were considered as indicators of
   pollution, and used to define pollution thresholds. The maximum amounts
   measured in the collected samples were 152 mg kg(-1) dry weight for
   lead, 25.65 mg kg(-1) dry weight for cadmium, 65.51 mg kg(-1) dry weight
   for nickel and 4.81 mg kg(-1) dry weight for arsenic.
   For analysing and communicating the findings, the BioMonRo software has
   been developed as a novel tool for warning-informing and
   decision-making. The software, now implemented by the Ministry of
   Environment for monitoring environmental quality, uses concentration
   data to build up national heavy metal pollution maps and can generate
   reports, which are automatically sent to various stakeholders. Based on
   our findings, we consider that tree species are efficient biomonitors,
   and similar methods could be successfully used in extensive
   bio-monitoring programmes (national, regional or European), and for
   informing authorities.}},

   attributes; (b) can community-level, functional responses to fire be
   obtained by coupling fire history with pollen derived plant traits; and
   (c) has directional selection promoted attributes that increase
   community flammability?
   LocationBreitenbush Lake, Oregon, USA.
   MethodsWe developed a framework based on ecological understanding of
   functional traits and pollen records to analyse variations in functional
   attribute expressions through time. Fire-related functional attributes
   that indicate sensitivity to changes in fire activity were identified
   and associated with taxa from a pollen record.
   ResultsNine of the 14 functional attributes were significantly related
   to fire frequency (number of fires 1,000 per year). When combined with
   fire history data, variation in the abundances of functional attributes
   suggest selection of plant community expressions that indicate
   community-level responses to fire related to changes in structural
   development and changes in fire adaptation. Fire frequency variations
   may drive directional selection for fire-adapted attributes, and against
   fire-sensitive attributes. Our results indicate increased Holocene fire
   activity may have been linked to vegetation functional interactions with
   fire.
   ConclusionsOur method of combining paleoecological data with functional
   traits allowed reconstruction of community-level changes in the
   expression of functional characteristics, providing evidence on
   structural development and changes in fire adaptation. Our results (a)
   highlight the capacity of paleoecological records to track plant
   community trait composition; (b) provide novel information on
   fire-vegetation relationships, independent of and complementary to
   conventional methods of disturbance-based paleoecological
   interpretations; (c) suggest the Holocene fire trend may be linked to
   the type of biomass being burned through directional selection; and (d)
   suggest an application that may be applied to quantify community
   responses to various disturbances across broad temporal and spatial
   scales.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly detailed records of long-term fire regime characteristics
   are needed to test ecological concepts and inform natural resource
   management and policymaking. We reconstructed and analyzed twelve 350+
   yr-long fire scar records developed from 2612 tree-ring dated fire scars
   on 432 living and dead pine (Pinus pungens, Pinus rigida, Pinus
   resinosa, Pinus echinata) trees from across central Pennsylvania. We
   used multiple spatial and time series analysis methods to quantify fire
   regime characteristics (frequency, seasonality, percentages of trees
   scarred, extent) and fire-climate-human associations. Prior to the
   20th-century fire suppression, fire regimes at the majority of sites
   consisted of frequent, low-to-moderate severity, dormant season fires.
   Fires were often regionally synchronous when preceded by significantly
   dry years. Using documentary archives, we provide the first description
   of a ``wave of fire{''}-an anthropogenic signal in fire frequency that
   progressively moved across the region. This ``wave of fire{''} reflects
   a changing progression of anthropogenic fire regimes from Native
   American occupation and depopulation, to Euro-American settlement, to
   industrialization and declining fire use up to the 20th century era of
   fire suppression. The wave of fire provides a new perspective on
   historical and modern fire regime dynamics and identifies
   socio-ecological impacts since North American colonization. Because the
   anthropogenic wave of fire exists at sites across North America, we
   emphasize the need for a broader determination of its geographic
   prevalence and variability as such determinations could influence
   historical ecology interpretations and perspectives on past and future
   roles of humans in managing ecosystems with fire.}},

Abstract = {{Many previous studies have attempted to assess ecological niche modeling
   performance using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) approaches,
   even though diverse problems with this metric have been pointed out in
   the literature. We explored different evaluation metrics based on
   independent testing data using the Darwin's Fox (Lycalopex fulvipes) as
   a detailed case in point. Six ecological niche models (ENMs; generalized
   linear models, boosted regression trees, Maxent, GARP, multivariable
   kernel density estimation, and NicheA) were explored and tested using
   six evaluation metrics (partial ROC, Akaike information criterion,
   omission rate, cumulative binomial probability), including two novel
   metrics to quantify model extrapolation versus interpolation (E-space
   index I) and extent of extrapolation versus Jaccard similarity (E-space
   index II). Different ENMs showed diverse and mixed performance,
   depending on the evaluation metric used. Because ENMs performed
   differently according to the evaluation metric employed, model selection
   should be based on the data available, assumptions necessary, and the
   particular research question. The typical ROC AUC evaluation approach
   should be discontinued when only presence data are available, and
   evaluations in environmental dimensions should be adopted as part of the
   toolkit of ENM researchers. Our results suggest that selecting Maxent
   ENM based solely on previous reports of its performance is a
   questionable practice. Instead, model comparisons, including diverse
   algorithms and parameterizations, should be the sine qua non for every
   study using ecological niche modeling. ENM evaluations should be
   developed using metrics that assess desired model characteristics
   instead of single measurement of fit between model and data. The metrics
   proposed herein that assess model performance in environmental space
   (i.e., E-space indices I and II) may complement current methods for ENM
   evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{The demographic consequences of stochasticity in processes such as
   survival and reproduction are modulated by the heterogeneity within the
   population. Therefore, to study effects of stochasticity on population
   growth and extinction risk, it is critical to use structured population
   models in which the most important sources of heterogeneity (e.g. age,
   size, developmental stage) are incorporated as i-state variables.
   Demographic stochasticity in heterogeneous populations has often been
   studied using one of two approaches: multitype branching processes and
   diffusion approximations. Here, we link these approaches, through the
   demographic stochasticity in age- or stage-structured matrix population
   models. We derive the demographic variance, sigma(2)(d), which measures
   the per capita contribution to the variance in population growth
   increment, and we show how it can be decomposed into contributions from
   transition probabilities and fertility across ages or stages.
   Furthermore, using matrix calculus we derive the sensitivity of
   sigma(2)(d) to age- or stage-specific mortality and fertility. We apply
   the methods to an extensive set of data from age-classified human
   populations (long-term time-series for Sweden, Japan and the
   Netherlands; two hunter-gatherer populations, and the high-fertility
   Hutterites), and to a size-classified population of the herbaceous plant
   Calathea ovandensis. For the human populations our analysis reveals
   substantial temporal changes in the demographic variance as well as its
   main components across age.
   These new methods provide a powerful approach for calculating the
   demographic variance for any structured model, and for analyzing its
   main components and sensitivities. This will make possible new analyses
   of demographic variance across different kinds of heterogeneity in
   different life cycles, which will in turn improve our understanding of
   mechanisms underpinning extinction risk and other important biological
   outcomes.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The conventional approach to conserving threatened biota is to identify
   drivers of decline, instigate actions to mitigate threatening processes,
   and monitor interventions to test their effectiveness and ensure target
   species recover. In Australia, predation by introduced predators is a
   threatening process for many native mammals. Here we report the results
   of a 15 year monitoring study in an iconic Australian reserve, Booderee
   National Park, where exotic Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) populations have
   been controlled through an intensive poison baiting program since 2003.
   Unexpectedly, we documented the collapse of native mammal fauna during
   this period, including fully arboreal species that should be largely
   unaffected by fox predation - such as the nationally Vulnerable Greater
   Glider (Petauroides volans) and Common Ringtail Possum (Pseudocheirus
   peregrinus).
   We used path analysis to explore potential causes of these unexpected
   declines. We found no compelling evidence to support hypotheses that
   competition with increasing native species, native predator release, or
   increases in native herbivores underpinned mammal declines. Beyond the
   path analysis, data from other studies completed both inside Booderee
   National Park and outside (where intensive fox baiting does not occur
   yet depleted fauna species remain), allowed us to rule out several
   drivers of change. The temporal declines we documented for arboreal
   marsupials were not anticipated nor explained by any clear mechanism.
   We propose the use of experimentally-guided reintroduction and
   translocations to: (1) restore empty niches such as the currently vacant
   apex mammal predator niche, (2) reconstruct the now depleted arboreal
   marsupial guild, and (3) further test key hypotheses associated with
   mammal decline. We also suggest that given the potential for perverse
   outcomes following large-scale management interventions (even those
   where there is high confidence of success), wildlife managers should
   consider maintaining reference areas (where there is no management
   intervention). Finally, as the declines we documented were unexpected
   and rapid, there is a clear need to develop more sensitive early warning
   signals to alert conservation managers to impending problems, allowing
   them to alter management regimes before major declines occur.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality and behavioral syndromes can have profound effects on
   individual fitness. Consequently, there is growing recognition that
   knowledge of these phenomena may assist with animal conservation. Here
   we review evidence for personality and behavioral syndromes in
   amphibians (the most threatened vertebrate class), critique experimental
   approaches, and explore whether knowledge in this domain might assist
   with endangered species management. Despite being a neglected field
   (research has spanned just 24 species), there is emerging evidence that
   frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts show personality and behavioral
   syndromes along three behavioral axes: boldness, exploration, and
   activity. Among vertebrates, amphibians are unique in having a biphasic
   lifecycle defined by metamorphosis and obvious transformations in
   morphology, physiology, and habitat use, characteristics that enable
   detailed examination of behavioral changes across life stages and
   ecological contexts. Accordingly, recent work has started to make
   important contributions to our understanding of the development and
   proximate causes of personality and behavioral syndromes, with some
   emerging evidence for ontogenetic stability, genetic control, and
   state-dependent personality. To date, however, no study has considered
   the conservation implications of personality for amphibians. Drawing on
   a conceptual framework and empirical literature for all vertebrates, we
   argue that there is considerable potential for knowledge of animal
   personality to improve amphibian conservation programs. We propose a
   novel paradigm to improve (i) the mating and reproductive success of
   captive animals by ensuring that breeding pairs are behaviorally
   compatible and (ii) the post-reintroduction survival and reproductive
   potential of animals by facilitating the selection of optimal behavioral
   types for release.
   Significance statement
   Animal personality and behavioral syndromes appear to be widespread in
   nature. Here, we review animal personality and behavioral syndromes in
   amphibians, an understudied taxonomic group within the field. We
   summarize evidence, critique methodological approaches used, and
   emphasize that the unique behavioral ecology of amphibians makes them a
   model group for studying the proximate causes and ecological
   consequences of personality and behavioral syndromes. We also highlight
   that knowledge of these phenomena may have significant conservation
   implications for amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction programs.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The introduction of non-indigenous species (NIS) via man-made
   corridors connecting previously disparate oceanic regions is increasing
   globally. However, the environmental and anthropogenic factors
   facilitating invasion dynamics and their interactions are still largely
   unknown. This study compiles and inputs available data for the NIS
   bivalve Brachidontes pharaonis across the invaded biogeographic range in
   the Mediterranean basin into a species distribution model to predict
   future spread under a range of marine scenarios.
   Location: Mediterranean Sea.
   Methods: A systematic review produced the largest presence database ever
   assembled to inform the selection of biological, chemical and physical
   factors linked to the spread of B. pharaonis through the Suez Canal. We
   carried out a sensitivity analysis to simulate current and future
   trophic and salinity scenarios. A species distribution model was run to
   determine key drivers of invasion, quantify interactive impacts arising
   from a range of trophic states, salinity conditions and climatic
   scenarios and forecast future trajectories for the spread of NIS into
   new regions under multiple-parameter scenarios (based on the main
   factors identified from the systematic review).
   Results: Impacts on invasion trajectory arising from climate change and
   interactions with increasing salinity from the new opening of the canal
   were the primary drivers of expansion across the basin, the effects of
   which were further enhanced by eutrophication. Predictions of the
   current distribution were most accurate when multiple stressors were
   used to drive the model. A habitat suitability index developed at a
   subcontinental scale from model outputs identified novel favourable
   conditions for future colonization at specific locations under 2030 and
   2050 climatic scenarios.
   Main conclusions: Future expansion of B. pharaonis will be enhanced by
   climate-facilitated increased sea temperature, interacting with
   increasing pressures from salinity and eutrophication. The spatially
   explicit risk output maps of invasions represent a powerful visual
   product for use in communication of the spread of NIS and
   decision-support tools for scientists and policymakers. The suggested
   approach, the observed distribution pattern and driving processes can be
   applied to other NIS species and regions by providing novel forecasts of
   species occurrences under future multiple stressor scenarios and the
   location of suitable recipient habitats with respect to anthropogenic
   and environmental parameters.}},

Title = {{Twilight-free geolocation from noisy light data}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1190-1198}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Solar geolocation is used to quantify the movements of animals tagged
   with sensors that record ambient light with respect to time. Global
   location sensor (GLS) tags are small, light, and present minimal drag or
   wing loading. They are affordable, and some can record data for several
   migratory cycles. These benefits mean they can be used in applications
   for which satellite tags are unsuitable. However, large errors in
   estimated locations can result if the sensor is obscured, especially
   around twilight, and sometimes the data obtained is unusable by existing
   methods of analysis due to this source of noise. This places limitations
   on the usefulness of solar geolocation in conservation and monitoring
   efforts.
   2. All existing methods of analysis are dependent on twilights being
   identifiable or faithfully recorded. Instead, the method introduced here
   depends on the overall pattern of day and night to calculate the
   likelihoods for a Hidden Markov Model, where the hidden states are
   geographic locations. We call this a ``twilight-free{''} method of
   light-based geolocation.
   3. This method quickly estimates locations from otherwise unusable noisy
   light data. We use examples to show that the method produces tracks that
   are comparable in accuracy and precision to other geolocation methods.
   Furthermore, efficiency and replicability of estimated paths are
   improved because the user does not have to subjectively identify
   twilights. Other data sources, such as sea surface temperature and land
   or sea masks are easily incorporated, further improving location
   estimates and processing speed.
   4. The twilight-free method offers new opportunities to researchers
   interested in the movements of animals that routinely have obscured
   sensors, or to analyse previously unusable noisy light data. It offers a
   fast, efficient, and replicable method for analysing tag data without
   the need for time-consuming pre- or post-processing. By increasing the
   yield of usable data from GLS tagging studies, researchers can more
   efficiently quantify where animals are going and when, and monitor
   changes in habitat. This is of fundamental importance to management and
   conservation efforts.}},

Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{305-321}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In order to achieve global energy supply security, environment-friendly,
   coordinated configuration and efficient use, the development of clean
   energy is imperative. In this paper, a clean energy development index
   evaluation index system with four grades is established from the two
   aspects of clean energy installed capacity and clean energy generation.
   Based on the improved entropy method of the sub-section and
   sub-dimension comprehensive evaluation model and the clean energy
   installed capacity and clean energy power generation of the year of 2013
   and 2014, the absolute, the relative and the incremental development
   index of various categories of clean energy in different countries is
   obtained, and then the overall clean energy absolute, the relative and
   the incremental development index of every country is calculated.
   Ultimately, the clean energy composite development index is obtained.
   According to the descriptive statistics analysis method and combined
   with the characteristics of clean energy development in studied
   countries, 231 countries are divided into four categories: A+ +, A +, A,
   A-. By changing the weight determination method, the efficiency
   coefficient entropy method is used to verify the level of clean energy
   development, and the Spearman correlation of the exponential results
   calculated by different methods is analyzed. The conclusion is drawn
   that the top 10 countries in the clean energy development index in 2014
   are the United States, China, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Kenya, the
   Philippines, Canada and New Zealand. In fully developed countries, the
   absolute, the relative and the comprehensive development index of dean
   energy are relatively high. In emerging countries, the incremental
   development indexes of clean energy are relatively high, and the
   emerging countries of the clean energy market have great potential for

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) is pivotal for biological, cheniical and
   physical processes and provides vital information on changes in soil
   fertility and land degradation. Rangelands, accounting for about 81\% of
   Australian land area; are significant carbon (C) stores and small
   increases in soil C sequestration over such a vast area represents a
   considerable climate change mitigation opportunity. Efficient modelling
   techniques to evaluate the potential to increase rangeland SOC stocks
   are vitally important to assess their role in the global carbon cycle
   and quantum abatement. This study aimed to evaluate boosted regression
   trees (BRT) and random forest (RF) models in predicting SOC stocks from
   available continuous remotely sensed variables using two feature
   selection techniques. Dominant variables that affect SOC stocks in the
   rangelands were also identified. Using field-based measurements of SOC
   stock collected from 564 data points across the study area and 28
   GIS-based environmental variables including climate, topography,
   radiometry, vegetation and land fractional cover data, we employed
   stepwise regression (SR, linear approach) and genetic algorithm (GA,
   nonlinear approach) to select the most informative variables. These
   selected predictors were then used to train the BRT and RF models. In
   all, four models were evaluated: BRT using SR (SR BRT); RF using SR (SR
   RF); BRT using GA (GA BRT) and RF using GA (GA RF). In addition, BRT
   using all predictors (All BRT) and the RF using all predictors (All\_RF)
   were used as benchmarks to test the performance of the four models. Of
   the field-based data, 75\% were used to train the model ({''}calibration

   of SOC stocks ({''}validation dataset{''}). The results indicate that
   the RF exhibited a better performance in predicting SOC stocks than the
   BRT regardless of input variables. In addition, we verified that feature
   selection for both machine learning techniques is necessary for
   estimating SOC stocks because they can increase accuracy and save time.
   The GA\_RF was the most reliable method to predict SOC stocks, with the
   lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and the highest R2 values (7.44 Mg
   C ha't and 0.48, respectively), suggesting that the method of using
   GA-RF to generate a predictive model from measured data and
   remotely-sensed variables may provide a cost effective alternative to
   direct sampling to predict SOC stocks in the semi-arid rangelands of
   `eastern Australia. The important variables for explaining the observed
   SOC stocks were rainfall, elevation, Prescott index (PI, a measure of
   water balance), and land fractional cover (bare ground fraction). The
   approach proposed here can be extended in areas where field observed
   data is scarce (e.g. rangelands) to produce more detailed information
   about SOC stocks..As such, the results of our study are of particular
   importance in Australian rangelands to provide a statistical and
   theoretical basis for producing digital SOC stock maps based on readily
   available remotely-sensed data, with potential for use in similar
   rangelands conditions internationally.}},

Abstract = {{Species distribution modeling' was recently ranked as one of the top
   five research fronts' in ecology and the environmental sciences by ISI's
   Essential Science Indicators, reflecting the importance of predicting
   how species distributions will respond to anthropogenic change.
   Unfortunately, species distribution models (SDMs) often perform poorly
   when applied to novel environments. Compounding on this problem is the
   shortage of methods for evaluating SDMs (hence, we may be getting our
   predictions wrong and not even know it). Traditional methods for
   validating SDMs quantify a model's ability to classify locations as used
   or unused. Instead, we propose to focus on how well SDMs can predict the
   characteristics of used locations. This subtle shift in viewpoint leads
   to a more natural and informative evaluation and validation of models
   across the entire spectrum of SDMs. Through a series of examples, we
   show how simple graphical methods can help with three fundamental
   challenges of habitat modeling: identifying missing covariates,
   non-linearity, and multicollinearity. Identifying habitat
   characteristics that are not well-predicted by the model can provide
   insights into variables affecting the distribution of species, suggest
   appropriate model modifications, and ultimately improve the reliability
   and generality of conservation and management recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{In an era of rapid climate change, understanding the natural capacity of
   species' ranges to track shifting climatic niches is a critical research
   and conservation need. Because species do not move across the landscape
   through empty space, but instead have to migrate through existing biotic
   communities, basic dispersal ecology and biotic interactions are
   important considerations beyond simple climate niche tracking.
   Yellow-cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis), a long-lived conifer of the
   North Pacific coastal temperate rainforest region, is thought to be
   undergoing a continued natural range expansion in southeast Alaska. At
   the same time, yellow-cedar's trailing edge is approaching its leading
   edge in the region, due to climate-induced root injury leading to
   widespread mortality over the past century. To examine the current
   dispersal capacity of yellow-cedar at its leading range edge, and
   potential for the species' leading edge to stay ahead of its trailing
   edge, we characterized recent yellow-cedar stand development near
   Juneau, Alaska, and surveyed the spread of yellow-cedar seedlings just
   beyond existing stand boundaries. Despite suitable habitat beyond stand
   edges, stand expansion appears limited in recent decades to centuries.
   Large quantities of seed are germinating within stands and just beyond
   boundaries, but seedlings are not developing to maturity. Furthermore,
   c. 100-200-year-old yellow-cedar trees are located abruptly at stand
   boundaries, indicating stand expansion is in a period of stasis with a
   last pulse at the end of the Little Ice Age climate period. Vegetative
   regeneration is common across stands and may be an adaptive strategy for
   this long-lived tree to persist on the landscape until conditions are
   favourable for successful seedling recruitment, leading to an overall
   punctuated migration and colonization of new landscapes.Synthesis.
   Species ranges do not always respond linearly to shifting climatic
   conditions. Instead, successful colonization of new habitat may be tied
   to episodic, threshold-related landscape phenomena, dispersal ability,
   and competition with existing plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{Plants leave species-specific legacies in the soil they grow in that can
   represent changes in abiotic or biotic soil properties. It has been
   shown that such legacies can affect future plants that grow in the same
   soil (plant-soil feedback, PSF). Such processes have been studied in
   detail, but mostly on individual plants. Here, we study PSF effects at
   the community level and use a trait-based approach both in the
   conditioning phase and in the feedback phase to study how 12 individual
   soil legacies influence six plant communities that differ in root size.
   We tested if (1) grassland perennial species with large root systems
   would leave a stronger legacy than those with small root systems, (2)
   grass species would leave a more positive soil legacy than forbs, and
   (3) communities with large root systems would be more responsive than
   small-rooted communities. We also tested (4)whether a leaf-chewing
   herbivore and a phloem feeder were affected by soil legacy effects in a
   community framework.
   Our study shows that the six different plant communities that we used
   respond differently to soil legacies of 12 different plant species and
   their functional groups. Species with large root systems did not leave
   stronger legacies than species with small root systems, nor were
   communities with large root systems more responsive than communities
   with root systems.
   Moreover, we show that when communities are affected by soil legacies,
   these effects carry over to the chewing herbivore Mamestra brassicae
   (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) through induced behavioural changes resulting
   in better performance of a chewing herbivore on forb-conditioned soils
   than on grass-conditioned soils, whereas performance of the phloem
   feeder Rhopalosiphum padi (Hemiptera: Aphididae) remained unaffected.
   Synthesis. The results of this study shed light on the variability of
   soil effects found in previous work on feedbacks in communities. Our
   study suggests that the composition of plant communities determines to a
   large part the response to soil legacies. Furthermore, the responses to
   soil legacies of herbivores feeding on the plant communities that we
   observed, suggests that in natural ecosystems, the vegetation history
   may also have an influence on contemporary herbivore assemblages. This
   opens up exciting new areas in plant-insect research and can have
   important implications for insect pest management.}},

Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{559-580}},

Abstract = {{1. Individual differences in contact rate can arise from host, group and
   landscape heterogeneity and can result in different patterns of spatial
   spread for diseases in wildlife populations with concomitant
   implications for disease control in wildlife of conservation concern,
   livestock and humans. While dynamic disease models can provide a better
   understanding of the drivers of spatial spread, the effects of landscape
   heterogeneity have only been modelled in a few well-studied wildlife
   systems such as rabies and bovine tuberculosis. Such spatial models tend
   to be either purely theoretical with intrinsic limiting assumptions or
   individual-based models that are often highly species- and
   system-specific, limiting the breadth of their utility.
   2. Our goal was to review studies that have utilized dynamic, spatial
   models to answer questions about pathogen transmission in wildlife and
   identify key gaps in the literature. We begin by providing an overview
   of the main types of dynamic, spatial models (e.g., metapopulation,
   network, lattice, cellular automata, individual-based and
   continuous-space) and their relation to each other. We investigate
   different types of ecological questions that these models have been used
   to explore: pathogen invasion dynamics and range expansion, spatial
   heterogeneity and pathogen persistence, the implications of management
   and intervention strategies and the role of evolution in host-pathogen
   dynamics.
   3. We reviewed 168 studies that consider pathogen transmission in
   free-ranging wildlife and classify them by the model type employed, the
   focal host-pathogen system, and their overall research themes and
   motivation. We observed a significant focus on mammalian hosts, a few
   well-studied or purely theoretical pathogen systems, and a lack of
   studies occurring at the wildlife-public health or wildlife-livestock
   interfaces.
   4. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions in the context
   of unprecedented human-mediated environmental change. Spatial models may
   provide new insights into understanding, for example, how global warming
   and habitat disturbance contribute to disease maintenance and emergence.
   Moving forward, better integration of dynamic, spatial disease models
   with approaches from movement ecology, landscape genetics/genomics and
   ecoimmunology may provide new avenues for investigation and aid in the
   control of zoonotic and emerging infectious diseases.}},

Abstract = {{1. New native woodlands are typically created in a small and isolated
   configuration, potentially reducing their value as a resource for
   biodiversity. The use of ecological networks for habitat restoration and
   creation could be beneficial for woodland biodiversity. This approach is
   conceptualised as local-and landscape-scale conservation actions
   designed to increase the area, quality, amount and connectivity of
   habitat types. However, there is limited evidence about the value of
   secondary woodlands and the relative or combined effects of network
   variables for woodland insects.
   2. Seventy-eight woodland sites created in the last 160 years across
   England and Scotland were sampled for hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae)
   and craneflies (Diptera: Tipuloidea), using two Malaise net traps placed
   in the centre of each woodland. The diversity of insects supported by
   created woodland patches was analysed using measures of dissimilarity,
   and the relative direct and indirect effects of ecological network
   variables on their abundance and species richness were assessed using
   structural equation models.
   3. We found 27\% of British woodland hoverfly species and 43\% of
   British woodland cranefly species in the study sites, indicating that
   woodland insects are colonising created native woodlands, despite their
   fragmented nature. However, these species communities were highly
   variable across woodland patches.
   4. Landscape-scale variables had no effect on woodland-associated
   hoverflies or craneflies relative to local-scale variables. Local-scale
   variables relating to habitat quality (i.e. structural heterogeneity of
   trees and understorey cover) had the strongest influence on abundance
   and species richness.
   5. Synthesis and applications. To benefit woodland-associated Diptera,
   woodland creation and restoration should maintain a focus on habitat
   quality. This should include active management to facilitate a diverse
   tree and understorey vegetation structure. Many woodlands in the UK are
   privately owned, and landowners should be encouraged to plant and
   actively manage their woodlands to increase structural heterogeneity and
   resources for woodland insects.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Vulnerability to climate change, and particularly to climate extreme
   events, is expected to vary across species ranges. Thus, we need tools
   to standardize the variability in regional climatic legacy and extreme
   climate across populations and species. Extreme climate events (e.g.,
   droughts) can erode populations close to the limits of species' climatic
   tolerance. Populations in climatic-core locations may also become
   vulnerable because they have developed a greater demand for resources
   (i.e., water) that cannot be enough satisfied during the periods of
   scarcity. These mechanisms can become exacerbated in tree populations
   when combined with antagonistic biotic interactions, such as insect
   infestation. We used climatic suitability indices derived from Species
   Distribution Models (SDMs) to standardize the climatic conditions
   experienced across Pinus edulis populations in southwestern North
   America, during a historical period (1972-2000) and during an extreme
   event (2001-2007), when the compound effect of hot drought and bark
   beetle infestation caused widespread die-off and mortality. Pinus edulis
   climatic suitability diminished dramatically during the die-off period,
   with remarkable variation between years. P. edulis die-off occurred
   mainly not just in sites that experienced lower climatic suitability
   during the drought but also where climatic suitability was higher during
   the historical period. The combined effect of historically high climatic
   suitability and a marked decrease in the climatic suitability during the
   drought best explained the range-wide mortality. Lagged effects of
   climatic suitability loss in previous years and co-occurrence of
   Juniperus monosperma also explained P. edulis die-off in particular
   years. Overall, the study shows that past climatic legacy, likely
   determining acclimation, together with competitive interactions plays a
   major role in responses to extreme drought. It also provides a new
   approach to standardize the magnitude of climatic variability across
   populations using SDMs, improving our capacity to predict population's
   or species' vulnerability to climatic change.}},

Abstract = {{Constraints of temperature on spring plant phenology are closely related
   to plant growth, vegetation dynamics, and ecosystem carbon cycle.
   However, the effects of temperature on leaf onset, especially for winter
   chilling, are still not well understood. Using long-term, widespread
   insitu phenology observations collected over China for multiple plant
   species, this study analyzes the quantitative response of leaf onset to
   temperature, and compares empirical findings with existing theories and
   modeling approaches, as implemented in 18 phenology algorithms. Results
   show that the growing degree days (GDD) required for leaf onset vary
   distinctly among plant species and geographical locations as well as at
   organizational levels (species and community), pointing to diverse
   adaptation strategies. Chilling durations (CHD) needed for releasing bud
   dormancy decline monotonously from cold to warm areas with very limited
   interspecies variations. Results also reveal that winter chilling is a
   crucial component of phenology models, and its effect is better captured
   with an index that accounts for the inhomogeneous effectiveness of low
   temperature to chilling rate than with the conventional CHD index. The
   impact of spring warming on leaf onset is nonlinear, better represented
   by a logistical function of temperature than by the linear function
   currently implemented in biosphere models. The optimized base
   temperatures for thermal accumulation and the optimal chilling
   temperatures are species-dependent and average at 6.9 and 0.2 degrees C,
   respectively. Overall, plants' chilling requirement is not a constant,
   and more chilling generally results in less requirement of thermal
   accumulation for leaf onset. Our results clearly demonstrate multiple
   deficiencies of the parameters (e.g., base temperature) and algorithms
   (e.g., method for calculating GDD) in conventional phenology models to
   represent leaf onset. Therefore, this study not only advances our
   mechanistic and quantitative understanding of temperature controls on
   leaf onset but also provides critical information for improving existing
   phenology models.}},

Abstract = {{Moving animal groups such as schools of fishes or flocks of birds often
   undergo sudden collective changes of their travelling direction as a
   consequence of stochastic fluctuations in heading of the individuals.
   However, the mechanisms by which these behavioural fluctuations arise at
   the individual level and propagate within a group are still unclear. In
   this study, we combine an experimental and theoretical approach to
   investigate spontaneous collective U-turns in groups of rummy-nose tetra
   (Hemigrammus rhodostomus) swimming in a ring-shaped tank. U-turns imply
   that fish switch their heading between the clockwise and anticlockwise
   direction. We reconstruct trajectories of individuals moving alone and
   in groups of different sizes. We show that the group decreases its
   swimming speed before a collective U-turn. This is in agreement with
   previous theoretical predictions showing that speed decrease facilitates
   an amplification of fluctuations in heading in the group, which can
   trigger U-turns. These collective U-turns are mostly initiated by
   individuals at the front of the group. Once an individual has initiated
   a U-turn, the new direction propagates through the group from front to
   back without amplification or dampening, resembling the dynamics of
   falling dominoes. The mean time between collective U-turns sharply
   increases as the size of the group increases. We develop an Ising spin
   model integrating anisotropic and asymmetrical interactions between fish
   and their tendency to follow the majority of their neighbours
   nonlinearly (social conformity). The model quantitatively reproduces key
   features of the dynamics and the frequency of collective U-turns
   observed in experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Human activities have altered continental ecosystems worldwide and

   questions on how to best produce goods while at the same time securing
   sustainable ecological services and raising needs to better understand
   and predict biodiversity and ecosystems dynamics under global changes.
   To tackle these questions, experimentation on ecosystems is necessary to
   improve our knowledge of processes and to propose scientifically sound
   management strategies. Experimental platforms able to manipulate key
   factors of global change and including state of the art observation
   methodologies are available worldwide but how to best integrate them has
   been rarely addressed. Here, we present and discuss the case of the
   national research infrastructure AnaEE France dedicated to the study of
   continental ecosystems and designed to congregate complementary
   experimental approaches in order to facilitate their access and use

   experimental facilities along a gradient of experimental control ranging
   from highly controlled Ecotron facilities, semi-natural field mesocosms
   to in natura experimental sites covering major continental ecosystems
   (forests, croplands, grasslands, and lakes). In addition, AnaEE France
   also includes shared instruments that can be implemented in experiments
   and analytical platforms specifically dedicated to environmental
   biology. To promote reuse of data, generalize results and improve
   predictive models, AnaEE France further gathers modeling and information
   systems. The implementation of AnaEE France allowed for mutual
   synergies, improved the technical skills, stimulated new experiments and

Abstract = {{Fitness can be calculated using demographic parameters such as survival
   and fecundity, which are normally used to examine population dynamics in
   ecology. This concept is at the heart of Darwin's thinking on natural

   through differential fitness, and these optimal schedules drive changes
   in population dynamics. Therefore, there must exist an interaction
   between ecology and evolution. One of the disciplines that focus on the
   interaction is ``Evolutionary demography{''}. It uses age-or
   stage-specific demographic parameters throughout the whole life history
   to explore the evolution of life histories. Data throughout the life
   history of a species is indispensable to study evolutionary demography.
   To this end, two large-scale databases of plant and animal life history

   COMADRE Animal Matrix Database. We are now in a revolutionary era in the

   by australopithecines from forest to savanna habitation. Novel
   environments are likely to have imposed hominids a demographic challenge
   due to such factors as higher predation risk and scarcer food resources.
   In fact, recent studies have found a paucity of older relative to
   younger adults in hominid fossil remains, indicating considerably high
   adult mortality in australopithecines, early Homo, and Neanderthals. It
   is not clear to date why only human ancestors among all hominoid species
   could survive in these harsh environments. In this paper, we explore the
   possibility that hominids had shorter interbirth intervals to enhance
   fertility than the extant apes. To infer interbirth intervals in fossil
   hominids, we introduce the notion of the critical interbirth interval,
   or the threshold length of birth spacing above which a population is
   expected to go to extinction. We develop a new method to obtain the
   critical interbirth intervals of hominids based on the observed ratios
   of older adults to all adults in fossil samples. Our analysis suggests
   that the critical interbirth intervals of australopithecines, early
   Homo, and Neanderthals are significantly shorter than the observed
   interbirth intervals of extant great apes. We also discuss possible
   factors that may have caused the evolutionary divergence of hominid life
   history traits from those of great apes.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive high-severity wildfires have driven major losses of ponderosa
   pine and mixed-conifer forests in the southwestern United States, in
   some settings catalyzing enduring conversions to non-forested vegetation
   types. Management interventions to reduce the probability of
   stand-replacing wildfire have included mechanical fuel treatments,
   prescribed fire, and wildfire managed for resource benefit. In 2011, the
   Las Conchas fire in northern New Mexico burned forested areas not
   exposed to fire for >100 yr, but also reburned numerous prescribed fire
   units and/or areas previously burned by wildfire. At some sites, the
   combination of recent prescribed fire and wildfire approximated known
   pre-settlement fire frequency, with two or three exposures to fire
   between 1977 and 2007. We analyzed gridded remotely sensed burn severity
   data (differenced normalized burn ratio), pre-and post-fire field
   vegetation samples, and pre-and post-fire measures of surface fuels to
   assess relationships and interactions between prescribed fire, prior
   wildfire, fuels, subsequent burn severity, and patterns of post-fire
   forest retention vs. conversion to non-forest. We found that Las Conchas
   burn severity was lowest, and tree survival was highest, in sites that
   had experienced both prescribed fire and prior wildfire. Sites that had
   experienced only prescribed or prior wildfire exhibited moderate burn
   severity and intermediate levels of forest retention. Sites lacking any
   recent prior fire burned at the highest severity and were overwhelmingly
   converted to non-forested vegetation including grassland, oak scrub, and
   weedy, herbaceous-dominated types. Burn severity in the Las Conchas fire
   was closely linked to surface woody fuel loads, which were reduced by
   prior wildfire and prescribed fire. Our results support the restoration
   of fire regimes via prescribed fire and resource benefit wildfire to
   promote the resiliency of forest types vulnerable to fire-mediated type
   conversion. The application of prescribed fire to reduce surface fuels
   following wildfire may reduce forest loss during subsequent fire under
   more extreme conditions. These findings are especially relevant given
   likely increases in vulnerability associated with climate change impacts
   to wildfire and forest dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by Europe's pressing need to overcome its water quality and water
   scarcity challenges, the speed of innovation in the water sector is
   outpacing that of science. The methodologies available to assess the
   impact of innovative solutions to water-related challenges remain
   limited and highly theoretical, which sets boundaries on their
   application and usefulness to water practitioners. This hampers the
   uptake of new technologies and innovative management practices, thus
   foregoing potential gains in resource efficiency and nature protection,
   as well as wider benefits to society and the economy. To address this
   gap, the DESSIN project developed a framework to evaluate the changes in
   ecosystem services (ESS) associated with technical or management
   solutions implemented at the water body, sub-catchment or catchment
   level. The framework was developed with a specific focus on freshwater
   ecosystems to allow for a more detailed exploration of practical
   implementation issues. Its development, testing and validation was
   carried out by conducting ESS evaluations in three different urban case
   study settings. The framework builds upon existing classification
   systems for ESS (CICES and FEGS-CS) and incorporates the DPSIR adaptive
   management scheme as its main structural element. This enables
   compatibility with other international initiatives on ESS assessments
   and establishes a direct link to the EU Water Framework Directive,

   the Ecosystem Services Approach, while pushing the discussion on how to
   promote more informed decision-making and support innovation uptake to
   address Europe's current water-related challenges. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The hydrology of riparian areas changes rapidly these years because of
   climate change-mediated alterations in precipitation patterns. In this
   study, we used a large-scale in situ experimental approach to explore
   effects of drought and flooding on plant taxonomic diversity and
   functional trait composition in riparian areas in temperate Europe. We
   found significant effects of flooding and drought in all study areas,
   the effects being most pronounced under flooded conditions. In
   near-stream areas, taxonomic diversity initially declined in response to
   both drought and flooding (although not significantly so in all years)
   and remained stable under drought conditions, whereas the decline
   continued under flooded conditions. For most traits, we found clear
   indications that the functional diversity also declined under flooded
   conditions, particularly in near-stream areas, indicating that fewer
   strategies succeeded under flooded conditions. Consistent changes in
   community mean trait values were also identified, but fewer than
   expected. This can have several, not mutually exclusive, explanations.
   First, different adaptive strategies may coexist in a community. Second,
   intraspecific variability was not considered for any of the traits. For
   example, many species can elongate shoots and petioles that enable them
   to survive shallow, prolonged flooding but such abilities will not be
   captured when applying mean trait values. Third, we only followed the
   communities for 3years. Flooding excludes species intolerant of the
   altered hydrology, whereas the establishment of new species relies on
   time-dependent processes, for instance the dispersal and establishment
   of species within the areas. We expect that altered precipitation
   patterns will have profound consequences for riparian vegetation in
   temperate Europe. Riparian areas will experience loss of taxonomic and
   functional diversity and, over time, possibly also alterations in
   community trait responses that may have cascading effects on ecosystem
   functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Climate-related extremes such as droughts have led to significant
   impacts on some watersheds. To assess watershed health and develop
   effective management plans, information about the function and structure
   of the watersheds in the context of their climatic response, especially
   to take into account rainfall anomalies and climate change adaptation,
   is needed. Integration of climatic variables with reliability,
   resilience and vulnerability (RRV) indicators, is a novel approach for
   generating this information. This study investigated the behavior of RRV
   indicators with respect to rainfall variability and drought patterns for
   three watersheds governed by different climates. Reliability was defined
   as the probability of a watershed to be in the range of satisfactory
   Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values. Resilience was indicated
   as the speed of recovery from an unsatisfactory condition. Vulnerability
   was defined as a function of the exposure of a watershed to climate
   change and variation using the SPI. The study areas were the Foyle
   Watershed in Northern Ireland (temperate oceanic, Cfb), the Xarrama
   Watershed in Portugal (Mediterranean hot summer, Csa) and the Shazand
   Watershed in Iran (moderate to cold semi-arid (Bsk). Based on the SPI
   pattern of each watershed, the SPI of -0.1 for the Foyle and Xarrama
   watersheds and +0.1 for the Shazand Watershed was selected as the
   drought threshold. The drought based RRV index was subsequently
   calculated from long-term (1981-2012) RRV indicators, resulting in means
   of 0.52 +/- 0.25, 0.53 +/- 0.21 and 0.30 +/- 0.18 for the three
   watersheds, respectively. These means reflect the status of the
   watersheds in terms of climatic conditions, which was moderate dry
   (0.41-0.60) for the Foyle and Xarrama watersheds and dry (0.21-0.40) for
   the Shazand Watershed. The temporal trend of the drought based RRV index
   was found to be non-significantly increasing (P-value > 0.52) for the
   Foyle and Xarrama watersheds and non-significantly decreasing for the
   Shazand Watershed (P-value > 0.48). The vulnerability indicator and
   drought based RRV index were significantly (p-value = 0.00) affected by
   the climatological gradient. The results of the conceptual framework
   linked to statistical trends can provide researchers, policy makers, and
   land managers a more comprehensive base to assess variability of
   watershed health and design drought management plans.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to the protection of nature in reserves, known as the

   concepts of the multilevel perspective on sustainable transitions, we
   will analyze two experimental cases in the Netherlands, in which the
   development of a sustainable, nature-friendly form of agriculture was
   attempted. In these experiments, new concepts of biodiversity
   monitoring, self-governance, and agriculture were developed in order to
   enhance biodiversity and the quality of nature on a regional scale. Our
   conclusion is that this sharing strategy has proved to be promising, at
   least in terms of relatively extensive use of agricultural areas. It
   should, however, not only include sharing of land use but also of
   responsibilities, knowledge development, aims, and means. Moreover, our

Abstract = {{1. Effective wildlife management and conservation depends on a detailed
   understanding of population dynamics at large spatial scales. Distance
   sampling is an efficient tool for landscape-scale monitoring, and the
   recent development of the open-population distance sampling framework
   for analysis allows efficient estimation of population parameters for
   unmarked populations.
   2. Applications of open-population distance approaches are relatively
   rare, and further development is required to generalize this powerful
   class of models for use in complex sampling scenarios.
   3. Here, we extend this class of models to situations where individuals
   occur in groups and address: the incorporation of group composition
   information, fluctuations in aggregation among individuals into groups,
   and non-repeated survey designs. We also describe a new parameter,
   kappa, representing the change in the rate of aggregation of individuals
   into groups over time. Using simulations, we assess the performance of
   this extended framework, and demonstrate its utility through an applied
   example using a Dall's sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) dataset collected in
   Alaska from 2009 to 2016.
   4. Our simulation study demonstrated that our extended model reliably
   recovered the data-generating parameter values without bias. In the
   applied example, we found that an abrupt decline in abundance observed
   in the Dall's sheep population was driven primarily by reductions in
   lambs and ewe-like sheep that coincided with the late onset of spring
   conditions in 2013. Rams were much less affected, suggesting declines in
   the ewe-like class drove overall population trajectory in this
   population.
   5. This work demonstrates how ecological questions related to the
   dynamics of group-dwelling species may be assessed in complex sampling
   situations using an open-population distance sampling framework. The
   resulting framework is broadly applicable to a variety of species and
   will be especially useful for evaluating population dynamics in unmarked
   populations of group-dwelling species at large spatial scales.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{1. Quantifying phenotypic evolutionary rates and their variation across
   phylogenetic trees is a major issue in evolutionary biology. A number of
   phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) currently perform such task.
   However, available PCMs can locate rate shifts pertaining to entire
   portions of the phylogeny, but not those expected to occur at the level
   of individual species and lineages, such as with the idea that body size
   changes more rapidly in insular vertebrates. Still, most PCMs cannot
   deal with fossil phylogenies, albeit fossils provide highly desirable
   information when it comes to understand trait variation and evolution.
   2. We developed a PCM based on phylogenetic ridge regression, which we
   named RRphylo, which assigns an evolutionary rate to each branch of the
   phylogeny, and is designed to locate rate shifts relating to entire
   clades, as well as to unrelated tree tips. We tested RRphylo on
   simulated trees and data to assess its performance under different
   conditions. Then, we repeated its application with two real case
   scenarios, the evolution of flight in ornithodirans and mammals and body
   size evolution in insular mammals, which are usually subsumed to evolve
   under different range regimes than terrestrial and continental species
   respectively.
   3. RRphylo performs well across all different conditions. The simulation
   experiments demonstrated it has low Type I and Type II error rate. We
   found significant evidence that flight accelerates the rate of body size
   evolution in vertebrates, and that the acquisition of very large body
   size slows down the rate. Still, insular mammals body size evolution is
   not faster than in continental species.
   4. RRphylo is a new PCM ideal to estimate variation and shift in the
   rate of phenotypic evolution with fossil data. In addition to testing
   evolutionary rate variation, it is open to a variety of further
   questions, such as the evolution of rates in time, the estimation of
   ancestral states and the estimation of phenotypic trends over time.}},

Abstract = {{1. The quantity of GPS trajectories on the movement of individuals has
   far outstripped our ability to analyse them. Segmentation, a first step
   in trajectory analysis, is fundamental to imputing behaviour from
   patterns of movement.
   2. Behaviour occurs at multiple scales that are captured at different
   temporal frequencies. To identify behaviour from a complex trajectory it
   is essential to use a segmentation procedure that captures different
   frequency ranges. A limitation of existing segmentation algorithms is
   that they require training and parameterisation that can lead to special
   use segmentations that are not generalisable.
   3. This paper presents a new approach to the automated segmentation of
   movement trajectories at multiple scales. It has two distinguishing
   characteristics: it can capture movement patterns at multiple temporal
   frequencies through its recursive application; and requires no training
   or thresholding.
   4. The methodology is tested on two sets of simulated data and GPS
   tracking data of two species, the Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura) and
   the Galapagos Albatross (Phoebastria irrorata). For the Turkey Vulture
   dataset, segments and transition points are evaluated using behavioural
   segmentations delineated by domain experts, and results are also
   compared with an existing approach. For the Albatross dataset, the
   segmentation results are evaluated using the geographic context of the
   movement tracks through visualisation. An Albatross trajectory is used
   to illustrate the application of recursive segmentation for extracting
   movement patterns at multiple temporal scales. The evaluation suggests
   that the segmentation technique is capable of extracting the right
   number of segments and in estimating transition points for most of the
   evaluated datasets.
   5. The proposed methodology has the potential to automate the
   segmentation process by enabling researchers to analyse a broad range of
   heterogeneous datasets without training. It will enable them to segment
   datasets recursively to derive multiple scales of movement patterns in a
   trajectory that may relate to different scales of behaviour.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. State-and-transition simulation models (STSMs) provide a general
   framework for forecasting landscape dynamics, including projections of
   both vegetation and landuse/land-cover (LULC) change. The STSM method
   divides a landscape into spatially referenced cells and then simulates
   the state of each cell forward in time, as a discrete-time stochastic
   process using a Monte Carlo approach, in response to any number of
   possible transitions. A current limitation of the STSM method, however,
   is that all of the state variables must be discrete.
   2. Here we present a new approach for extending a STSM, in order to
   account for continuous state variables, called a STSM with stocks and
   flows (STSM-SF). The STSM-SF method allows for any number of continuous
   stocks to be defined for every spatial cell in the STSM, along with a
   suite of continuous flows specifying the rates at which stock levels
   change over time. The change in the level of each stock is then
   simulated forward in time, for each spatial cell, as a discrete-time
   stochastic process. The method differs from the traditional systems
   dynamics approach to stock-flow modelling in that the stocks and flows
   can be spatially explicit, and the flows can be expressed as a function
   of the STSM states and transitions.
   3. We demonstrate the STSM-SF method by integrating a spatially explicit
   carbon (C) budget model with a STSM of LULC change for the state of
   Hawai'i, USA. In this example, continuous stocks are pools of
   terrestrial C, whereas the flows are the possible fluxes of C between
   these pools. Importantly, several of these C fluxes are triggered by
   corresponding LULC transitions in the STSM. Model outputs include
   changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of C pools and fluxes
   across the landscape in response to projected future changes in LULC
   over the next 50 years.
   4. The new STSM-SF method allows both discrete and continuous state
   variables to be integrated into a STSM, including interactions between
   them. With the addition of stocks and flows, STSMs provide a
   conceptually simple yet powerful approach for characterizing
   uncertainties in projections of a wide range of questions regarding
   landscape change.}},

Title = {{Spiders as potential bioindicators of mountain grasslands health: the
   Argentine tarantula Grammostola vachoni (Araneae, Theraphosidae)}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{64-71}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Context. Bioindicators are used for conservation prioritisation by means
   of spatial comparisons of a site value, or monitoring of ecosystem
   recovery or response to management. Spiders are characterised by their
   selection of quality habitats and guild responses to environmental
   change. However, they have only occasionally been used as bioindicators.
   Grammostola vachoni is an endemic tarantula that only occurs in the
   grasslands of the mountainous system in central Argentina and it is
   included in the Red List of the IUCN as Vulnerable.
   Aims. In this study, we performed a characterisation of the microhabitat
   of G. vachoni at sites with different disturbance regimes and we
   analysed the potential use of this species as a bioindicator of mountain
   grassland health.
   Methods. We determined the microhabitat characteristics around their
   refuges by mean of the soil parameters, as well as the composition and
   structure of vegetation and amount of refuge available.
   Key results. We found significant differences in the number of
   individuals and the percentage of occupation between sites. No
   significant differences were recorded in the soil characteristics and
   occupation of G. vachoni but we found that the composition of
   vegetation, and the heterogeneity and diversity of plants are influenced
   by different disturbance regimes, altering the distribution of spiders.
   Conclusions. Our results are consistent with those of other studies
   where the spiders have proved to be good bioindicators of different
   disturbances and we propose for the first time a Theraphosidae species
   for evaluating the state or health of a natural grassland.
   Implications. The information reported in this study is very important

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence to support that paleo-timescale events are
   important determinants in the present-day distribution of organisms. We
   explored the relationship between community composition of tidal marsh
   birds in the northeastern United States and potential drivers of
   biodiversity patterns across timescales to explore the relevance of
   historical contingency in this ecosystem. These potential predictors
   represent some of the major known influences on biodiversity in tidal
   marshes, including 1) a recent, intense hurricane event driving a
   large-scale perturbation of this ecosystem (4 yr), 2) gradual
   modification of marshes through installation of human infrastructure
   (similar to 150 yr), and 3) marsh formation and development after the
   Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, similar to 20 000 yr). We surveyed > 1300
   locations in tidal marshes from 2011-2014 using passive point count
   methods to measure bird community composition at these points. We found
   that rarefied richness, total individuals (N), and total biomass were
   best explained by a quadratic relationship with marsh age peaking at 40
   degrees latitude, the location of the Last Glacial Maximum of the
   Laurentide ice sheet. We hypothesize that formation of marsh millennia
   earlier in the southern part of our survey area allowed for earlier
   evolution of specialization to tidal marsh by bird species than those
   occupying much younger, northern marshes, which could have then driven
   differential rates of colonization in the north (by habitat generalists)
   and competitive exclusion in the south (by habitat specialists). We
   tested this theory using a novel functional diversity metric (community
   habitat specialization index, or CHSI) and find that community
   specialization decreased linearly with marsh age, supporting our
   hypothesis. Our findings highlight the importance for consideration of
   historical contingency in biodiversity research and further exploration
   of mechanisms operating across geological timescales.}},

   the urban park demonstrates z (d) determined with two anemometric
   methods is responsive to vegetation state and is 1-4 m greater during
   leaf-on periods. The seasonal change and directional variability in the
   magnitude of z (d) is reproduced by the morphometric methods, which also

   Wind speeds at approximately 3 times the average roughness-element

Abstract = {{Conservation professionals recognize the need to evaluate education
   initiatives with a flexible approach that is culturally appropriate.
   Cultural-consensus theory (CCT) provides a framework for measuring the
   extent to which beliefs are communally held and has long been applied by
   social scientists. In a conservation-education context, we applied CCT
   and used free lists (i.e., a list of items on a topic stated in order of
   cultural importance) and domain analysis (analysis of how free lists go
   together within a cultural group) to evaluate a conservation education
   program in which we used a children's picture book to increase knowledge
   about and empathy for a critically endangered mammal, the Javan slow
   loris (Nycticebus javanicus). We extracted free lists of keywords
   generated by students (n = 580 in 18 schools) from essays they wrote
   before and after the education program. In 2 classroom sessions
   conducted approximately 18 weeks apart, we asked students to write an
   essay about their knowledge of the target species and then presented a
   book and several activities about slow loris ecology. Prior to the
   second session, we asked students to write a second essay. We generated
   free lists from both essays, quantified salience of terms used, and
   conducted minimal residuals factor analysis to determine presence of
   cultural domains surrounding slow lorises in each session. Students
   increased their use of words accurately associated with slow loris
   ecology and conservation from 43\% in initial essays to 76\% in final
   essays. Domain coherence increased from 22\% to 47\% across schools.
   Fifteen factors contributed to the domain slow loris. Between the first
   and second essays, factors that showed the greatest change were feeding
   ecology and slow loris as a forest protector, which increased 7-fold,
   and the humancentric factor, which decreased 5-fold. As demonstrated by
   knowledge retention and creation of unique stories and conservation
   opinions, children achieved all six levels of Bloom's taxonomy of
   learning domains. Free from the constraints of questionnaires and
   surveys, CCT methods provide a promising avenue to evaluate conservation
   education programs.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging insights into factors responsible for soil organic matter
   stabilization and decomposition are being applied in a variety of
   contexts, but new tools are needed to facilitate the understanding,
   evaluation, and improvement of soil biogeochemical theory and models at
   regional to global scales. To isolate the effects of model structural
   uncertainty on the global distribution of soil carbon stocks and
   turnover times we developed a soil biogeochemical testbed that forces
   three different soil models with consistent climate and plant
   productivity inputs. The models tested here include a first-order,
   microbial implicit approach (CASA-CNP), and two recently developed
   microbially explicit models that can be run at global scales (MIMICS and
   CORPSE). When forced with common environmental drivers, the soil models
   generated similar estimates of initial soil carbon stocks (roughly
   1,400Pg C globally, 0-100cm), but each model shows a different
   functional relationship between mean annual temperature and inferred
   turnover times. Subsequently, the models made divergent projections
   about the fate of these soil carbon stocks over the 20(th) century, with
   models either gaining or losing over 20 Pg C globally between 1901 and
   2010. Single-forcing experiments with changed inputs, temperature, and
   moisture suggest that uncertainty associated with freeze-thaw processes
   as well as soil textural effects on soil carbon stabilization were
   larger than direct temperature uncertainties among models. Finally, the
   models generated distinct projections about the timing and magnitude of
   seasonal heterotrophic respiration rates, again reflecting structural
   uncertainties that were related to environmental sensitivities and
   assumptions about physicochemical stabilization of soil organic matter.
   By providing a computationally tractable and numerically consistent
   framework to evaluate models we aim to better understand uncertainties
   among models and generate insights about factors regulating the turnover

Abstract = {{Grazing by overabundant herbivores can cause land degradation and reduce
   biological diversity, Across arid and semi-arid Australia, predator
   control, pasture improvement, and artificial water points (AWP) have
   contributed to increased populations of kangaroos and wallaroos
   (Macropus spp.). Control efforts (e.g. culling,. predator
   reintroduction, fertility control) can be expensive, controversial
   and/or unsustainable in the long term. Closure of AWP is an alternative.
   We reviewed closures in Australia and found experimental tests have been
   few, and results unconvincing for two main reasons. Firstly, no study
   has tested AWP closures over distances influential to kangaroos. We
   identified seven AWP closure experiments in Australia. Five did not
   generate areas beyond 5 km from water and two used a method ineffective
   for excluding kangaroos. Secondly, post-closure monitoring has
   frequently been too short to detect changes amongst natural
   environmental fluctuations. Our own experimental AWP closure did not
   influence kangaroo populations and reaffirmed that kangaroo densities
   are dictated by food availability in Australia's water rich rangelands.
   Larger experiments are needed with systematic AWP closures that generate
   water remote landscapes, preferably exceeding 10 km from water.
   Monitoring must span dry, hot periods of below average rainfall when
   kangaroos are most likely dependent on drinking water.}},

   Resources}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{Conservation resources have become increasingly limited and, along with
   social, cultural and political complexities, this shortfall frequently
   challenges effectiveness in conservation. Because conservation can be
   costly, efforts are often only initiated after a species has declined
   below a critical threshold and/or when statutory protection is mandated.
   However, implementing conservation proactively, rather than reactively,
   is predicted to be less costly and to decrease a species' risk of
   extinction. Despite these benefits, I document that the number of
   studies that have implemented proactive conservation around the world
   are far fewer than those that simply acknowledge the need for such
   action. I provide examples of proactive actions that can ameliorate
   shortfalls in funding and other assets, thus helping conservation
   practitioners and managers cope with the constraints that resource
   limitation imposes. Not all of these options are new; however, the
   timing of their implementation is critical for effective conservation,
   and the need for more proactive conservation is increasingly recognized.
   These actions are (1) strengthening and diversifying stakeholder
   involvement in conservation projects; (2) complementing time-consuming
   and labor-intensive demographic studies with alternative approaches of
   detecting declines and estimating extinction risk; and (3) minimizing
   future costly conservation and management by proactively keeping common
   species common. These approaches may not constitute a cure-all for every
   conservation crisis. However, given escalating rates of species' losses,
   perhaps a reminder that these proactive actions can reduce conservation
   costs, save time, and potentially thwart population declines is
   warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate identification of soil erosion hot spots across catchments of
   different sizes and agro-ecologies through the use of conventional
   tracing techniques has proven challenging. Since this problem hinders
   implementation of precise soil conservation measures by land managers
   and decision-making bodies, novel evidence-based techniques are needed.
   To meet this need, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA, Vienna,
   Austria) initiated the Coordinated Research Project entitled
   ``Integrated Isotopic Approaches for an Area-wide Precision Conservation
   to Control the Impacts of Agricultural Practices on Land Degradation and
   Soil Erosion - D1.20.11{''} in 2008. This project emphasized the
   application of isotopic approaches to identify hot spots of land
   degradation in agricultural catchments to develop effective soil
   conservation measures. As one key outcome of this project, we present
   here an aligned protocol to explore the potential of compound-specific
   stable isotope (CSSI) analysis of individual fatty acids (FA) combined
   with Bayesian statistics to discriminate sediment sources across six
   catchments of different sizes and agro-ecologies. The global
   applicability of the CSSI approach was first tested on the basis of
   major land use categories (i.e., forest, cultivated and non-cultivated
   land) as potential sediment sources in the studied catchments. These
   land use categories were then further resolved into specific land use
   types (e.g., cassava and maize fields, orchards) to assess the potential
   resolution threshold of the CSSI technique. In a final step, the
   influence of miscellaneous sources (e.g., roads, channel banks) that had
   the potential to distort proportional contributions to sediment
   deposition was assessed. The introduced aligned protocol of the CSSI
   technique was applied to discriminate individual erosion sources based
   on land use types of tested catchments. Merging catchment-specific land
   use types with broader land use categories made it possible to determine
   inter catchment comparisons of isotopic signatures due to significant
   differences in delta C-13 values of fatty acids when cultivated land was
   present. Notably, no correlations were found between different catchment
   sizes, agroecologies, number and type of land use types, or soil organic
   carbon concentrations and the number of significant delta C-13 fatty
   acid values of the various land use types. Thus, we propose that the
   presented CSSI technique has the potential to identify soil erosion hot
   spots in contrasting catchments of different sizes and agro-ecologies.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Structural and compositional changes along post-fire succession
   modify plant community proneness to burn (flammability). The dominant
   regeneration strategies and life forms, and their interactions along
   post-fire succession, modulate these changes by affecting density,
   amount and connectivity of fuels. Depending on how flammability evolves
   during post-fire succession it may feed back negatively, neutrally or
   positively into fire probability and behaviour. Negative fire-vegetation
   feedbacks arise when communities increase flammability as stands age,
   while positive feedbacks occur where early stages have higher
   flammability than later stages. We characterized changes in vegetation
   structure and fuel characteristics with time since fire in sites where
   either resprouters maintained dominance (shrublands), or where colonizer
   trees reached the sites and dominate later post-fire stages (forests).
   Location: Northwestern Patagonia, Argentina.
   Methods: We measured vegetation structure and characterized fine fuels
   with the intercept pole method in stands of different post-fire age in
   18 shrublands (range 1-115 years) and 18 forests (range 7-216 years).
   Results: In shrublands fuel amount quickly recovered after fire to a
   relatively constant value and fine fuel density remained high.
   Conversely, in forests, fuel amount rapidly increased during early
   post-fire stages (when resprouting shrubs dominate the community),
   peaked at c. 30-50 years (related to the co-existence of resprouters and
   young trees) and decreased to a relatively constant value (when tall
   trees dominate the community and suppress resprouters). Moreover, forest
   fuel density decreased with time. These changes in fuel characteristics
   were largely linked to changes in vegetation structure, which in turn
   were modulated by the dominant regeneration strategies and life forms.
   Conclusions: Our results provide evidence of a positive fire-vegetation
   feedback for the community dominated by colonizer trees, while the
   community dominated by resprouter shrubs showed a neutral feedback.
   Given the co-existence of flammable shrublands bordering fire-sensitive
   forests and their low tree regeneration rates, we argue that forest
   communities are especially sensitive to changes in fire frequency and
   severity driven by global change. Anthropogenic or climate-driven
   changes in ignitions are threatening these landscapes, which may undergo
   potentially rapid transformations, as seen in other temperate
   ecosystems.}},

   still discussed, and fundamental questions remain. Here, we target the
   seed bank compartment of the rare biosphere, assess the level of rarity
   at which micro-organisms are still able to colonize an ecosystem and
   investigate whether rare species are functionally redundant. Using an
   original experimental design where wood in aquaria was inoculated with
   increasingly diluted coastal seawater, we show that bacteria that
   represented as few as 0.00000002\% of the cells in the environment (or 1
   cell in 10L of seawater) were still able to grow and play key roles
   within the ecosystem. Our experiment further showed that some bacteria
   can be replaced by others that have the potential to fulfil the same
   metabolic tasks. This finding suggests some functional redundancy within
   bacterial species. However, when ultrarare bacteria were progressively
   removed, productivity was reduced, and below a certain threshold some
   processes were lost, and the function of the ecosystem was altered.
   Overall the study shows that bacteria that are not detected by
   high-throughput sequencing approaches are nevertheless viable and able
   to colonize new ecosystems, suggesting the need to consider ultrarare
   microbes in the marine environment.}},

Abstract = {{Resource selection functions (RSFs) are tremendously valuable for
   ecologists and resource managers because they quantify spatial patterns
   in resource utilization by wildlife, thereby facilitating identification
   of critical habitat areas and characterizing specific habitat features
   that are selected or avoided. RSFs discriminate between known-use
   resource units (e.g., telemetry locations) and available (or randomly
   selected) resource units based on an array of environmental features,
   and in their standard form are performed using logistic regression. As
   generalized linear models, standard RSFs have some notable limitations,
   such as difficulties in accommodating nonlinear (e.g., humped or
   threshold) relationships and complex interactions. Increasingly,
   ecologists are using flexible machine-learning methods (e.g., random
   forests, neural networks) to overcome these limitations. Herein, we
   investigate the seasonal resource selection patterns of mule deer
   (Odocoileus hemionus) by comparing a logistic regression framework with
   random forest (RF), a popular machine-learning algorithm. Random forest
   (RF) models detected nonlinear relationships (e.g., optimal ranges for
   slope and elevation) and complex interactions which would have been very
   challenging to discover and characterize using standard model-based
   approaches. Compared with standard RSF models, RF models exhibited
   improved predictive skill, provided novel insights about resource
   selection patterns of mule deer, and, when projected across a relevant
   geographic space, manifested notable differences in predicted habitat
   suitability. We recommend that wildlife researchers harness the
   strengths of machine-learning tools like RF in addition to classical
   tools (e.g., mixed-effects logistic regression) for evaluating resource
   selection, especially in cases where extensive telemetry data sets are
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a new research tool to obtain

   submeter scales in south-eastern Arizona, USA. The UAV lidar scanner
   characterized the individual vegetation canopy structure and bare ground
   elevation, whereas the hyperspectral sensor provided species-specific
   spectral signatures for the dominant and target species at our study
   area in leaf-on condition. We hypothesized that the fusion of the two
   different data sources would perform better than either data type alone
   in the arid and semi-arid ecosystems with sparse vegetation. The fusion
   approach provides 84-89\% overall accuracy (kappa values of 0.80-0.86)
   in target species classification at the canopy scale, leveraging a wide
   range of target spectral responses in the hyperspectral data and a high
   point density (50 points/m(2)) in the lidar data. In comparison, the
   hyperspectral image classification alone produced 72-76\% overall

   digital elevation model (DEM) is also strongly correlated with manned
   airborne lidar-derived DEM (R-2 = 0.98 and 0.96), but was obtained at a

   essentially described by the pair correlation function of the superposed
   process and that it is governed by the most abundant species. We test
   our analytical model with empirical data obtained for the Barro Colorado
   Island and Pasoh rainforests. To this end we adopt the statistical

Abstract = {{Establishing the sex of individuals in wild systems can be challenging
   and often requires genetic testing. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and
   other reduced-representation DNA sequencing (RRS) protocols (e.g.,
   RADseq, ddRAD) have enabled the analysis of genetic data on an
   unprecedented scale. Here, we present a novel approach for the discovery
   and statistical validation of sex-specific loci in GBS data sets. We
   used GBS to genotype 166 New Zealand fur seals (NZFS, Arctocephalus
   forsteri) of known sex. We retained monomorphic loci as potential
   sex-specific markers in the locus discovery phase. We then used (i) a
   sex-specific locus threshold (SSLT) to identify significantly
   male-specific loci within our data set; and (ii) a significant
   sex-assignment threshold (SSAT) to confidently assign sex in silico the
   presence or absence of significantly male-specific loci to individuals
   in our data set treated as unknowns (98.9\% accuracy for females; 95.8\%
   for males, estimated via cross-validation). Furthermore, we assigned sex
   to 86 individuals of true unknown sex using our SSAT and assessed the
   effect of SSLT adjustments on these assignments. From 90 verified
   sex-specific loci, we developed a panel of three sex-specific PCR
   primers that we used to ascertain sex independently of our GBS data,
   which we show amplify reliably in at least two other pinniped species.
   Using monomorphic loci normally discarded from large SNP data sets is an
   effective way to identify robust sex-linked markers for nonmodel
   species. Our novel pipeline can be used to identify and statistically
   validate monomorphic and polymorphic sex-specific markers across a range
   of species and RRS data sets.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the performance of a new metabarcoding approach to
   investigate the environmental diversity of a prominent group of
   widespread unicellular organisms, the Cercozoa. Cercozoa is an immensely
   large group of protists, and although it may dominate in soil and
   aquatic ecosystems, its environmental diversity remains undersampled. We
   designed PCR primers targeting the hypervariable region V4 of the small
   subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU or 18S) gene, which is the recommended
   barcode marker for Cercozoa. The length of the amplified fragment (c.
   350bp) is suitable for Illumina MiSeq, the most cost-effective platform
   for molecular environmental surveys. We provide barcoded primers, an
   economical alternative to multiple libraries for multiplex sequencing of
   over a hundred samples. In silico, our primers matched 68\% of the
   cercozoan sequences of the reference database and performed better than
   previously proposed new-generation sequencing primers. In mountain
   grassland soils and in biological soil crusts from a variety of climatic
   regions, we were able to detect cercozoan sequences encompassing nearly
   the whole range of the phylum. We obtained 901 operational taxonomic
   units (OTUs) at 97\% similarity threshold from 26 samples, with c.
   50,000 sequences per site, and only 8\% of noncercozoan sequences. We
   could report a further increase in the diversity of Cercozoa, as only
   43\% of the OTUs were 97\%-100\% similar to any known sequence. Our

   with stand-replacing fire regimes}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Building resilience to natural disturbances is a key to managing forests
   for adaptation to climate change. To date, most climate adaptation
   guidance has focused on recommendations for frequent-fire forests,
   leaving few published guidelines for forests that naturally experience
   infrequent, stand-replacing wildfires. Because most such forests are
   inherently resilient to stand-replacing disturbances, and burn severity
   mosaics are largely indifferent to manipulations of stand structure
   (i.e., weather-driven, rather than fuel-driven fire regimes), we posit
   that pre-fire climate adaptation options are generally fewer in these
   regimes relative to others. Outside of areas of high human value,
   stand-scale fuel treatments commonly emphasized for other forest types
   would undermine many of the functions, ecosystem services, and other
   values for which these forests are known. For stand-replacing
   disturbance regimes, we propose that (1) managed wildfire use (e.g.,
   allowing natural fires to burn under moderate conditions) can be a
   useful strategy as in other forest types, but likely confers fewer
   benefits to long-term forest resilience and climate adaptation, while
   carrying greater socio-ecological risks; (2) reasoned fire exclusion
   (i.e., the suppression component of a managed wildfire program) can be
   an appropriate strategy to maintain certain ecosystem conditions and
   services in the face of change, being more ecologically justifiable in
   long-interval fire regimes and producing fewer of the negative
   consequences than in frequent-fire regimes; (3) low-risk pre-disturbance
   adaptation options are few, but the most promising approaches emphasize
   fundamental conservation biology principles to create a safe operating
   space for the system to respond to change (e.g., maintaining
   heterogeneity across scales and minimizing stressors); and (4)
   post-disturbance conditions are the primary opportunity to implement
   adaptation strategies (such as protecting live tree legacies and testing
   new regeneration methods), providing crucial learning opportunities.
   This approach will provide greater context and understanding of these
   systems for ecologists and resource managers, stimulate future
   development of adaptation strategies, and illustrate why public
   expectations for climate adaptation in these forests will differ from
   those for frequent-fire forests.}},

Abstract = {{We reviewed the availability of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)
   sequences for 2534 North American freshwater invertebrate genera in
   public databases (GenBank and Barcode of Life Data Systems) and assessed
   representation of genera commonly encountered in the Canadian Aquatic
   Biomonitoring Network (CABIN) database. COI sequence records were
   available for 61.2\% of North American genera and 72.4\% of Insecta
   genera in public databases. Mollusca (73.9\%) and Nematoda (15.4\%) were
   the best and worst represented groups, respectively. In CABIN, 85.4\% of
   genera had COI sequence records, and 95.2\% of genera occurring in > 1\%
   of samples were represented. Genera absent from CABIN tended to be
   uncommon or members of groups not routinely used for biomonitoring
   purposes. On average, 94.1\% of genera in well-identified samples had
   associated sequence data. To leverage the full potential of genomics
   approaches, we must expand DNA-barcode reference libraries for poorly
   described components of freshwater food webs. Some genera appear to be
   well represented (e.g., Eukiefferiella),but deposited sequences
   represent few sampling localities or few species and lead to
   underestimation of sequence diversity at the genus level and reduced
   confidence in identifications. Public COI libraries are sufficiently
   populated to permit routine application of genomics tools in
   biomonitoring, and ongoing quality assurance/quality control should
   include re-evaluation as new COI reference sequences are added or
   taxonomic hierarchies change. Next, we must understand whether and how
   established biomonitoring approaches can capitalize on high-throughput
   sequencing tools. Biomonitoring approaches that use genomics data to
   facilitate structural and functional assessments are fertile ground for
   future investigation and will benefit from continued improvement of

Abstract = {{The recognition that we are in the distinct new epoch of the

   to embrace the concept of evidence-based restoration. Evidence-based
   restoration involves the use of rigorous, repeatable, and transparent
   methods (i.e. systematic reviews) to identify and amass relevant
   knowledge sources, critically evaluate the science, and synthesize the
   credible science to yield robust policy and/or management advice needed

   as a tool to identify the knowledge gaps and the type of science needed
   (e.g. repeatable, appropriate replication, use of controls) to improve
   the evidence base. The restoration community, including both scientists
   and practitioners, needs to make evidence-based restoration a reality so

Volume = {{45}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Winteraceae comprise c.130 species in seven genera, with the
   greatest species diversity in the Pacific (Pseudowintera, Zygogynum),
   Australia (Bubbia, Tasmannia), New Guinea (Belliolum, Bubbia, Zygogynum,
   Tasmannia) and Madagascar (Takhtajania). Only Drimys occurs in South
   America. Because of their Cretaceous leaves, wood and pollen fossils,
   and their lack of xylem vessels, Winteraceae throw light on early
   angiosperm evolution. We describe a Winteraceae pollen tetrad from the
   Paleocene of Greenland, review the family's fossil record and
   palaeogeography and document its current climate preferences.
   Location: Worldwide.
   Methods: Extant and fossil pollen were studied with light and scanning
   electron microscopy. Molecular phylogenetic and character mapping
   approaches were used to infer the evolution of pollen characters, and
   37,842 collections from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
   were used to infer the climate and vegetation types occupied by today's
   Winteraceae and to compare them to the Paleocene climate and vegetation
   of Greenland as inferred from the fossil record of other families.
   Results: Winteraceae are the only flowering plants with persistent,
   acalymmate tetrads composed of ulcerate grains with a distinct
   reticulate sculpturing. The tetrad described here as Pseudowinterapollis
   agatdalensis Grimsson \& Zetter spec. nov. comes from Agatdalen valley
   in western Greenland and dates to the Early Paleocene, Danian, 64-62Ma.
   It shows the complete character suite of modern Winteraceae and overlaps
   the LM characters of the three previously known Pseudowinterapollis
   species from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The palaeoflora of
   the Agatdal Formation consisted of a mixed deciduous-evergreen forest
   resembling habitats where Winteraceae occur today.
   Main conclusions: Macro- and microfossil records of Winteraceae extend
   back to the Upper Cretaceous in both Laurasia and Gondwana, and the
   family's biogeography, like that of its sister family, Canellaceae,
   cannot be understood by focusing only on southern Gondwana. Winteraceae
   instead were part of broadleaved forests in Paleocene and Eocene North
   American and Greenland and may have reached Europe via the North
   Atlantic Land Bridge, explaining Eocene Winteraceae wood in northern
   Germany.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{810-819}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Disease models typically focus on temporal dynamics of infection,
   while often neglecting environmental processes that determine host
   movement. In many systems, however, temporal disease dynamics may be
   slow compared to the scale at which environmental conditions alter host
   space-use and accelerate disease transmission.
   2. Using a mechanistic movement modelling approach, we made space-use
   predictions of a mobile host (elk {[}Cervus Canadensis] carrying the
   bacterial disease brucellosis) under environmental conditions that
   change daily and annually (e.g., plant phenology, snow depth), and we
   used these predictions to infer how spring phenology influences the risk
   of brucellosis transmission from elk (through aborted foetuses) to
   livestock in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
   3. Using data from 288 female elk monitored with GPS collars, we fit
   step selection functions (SSFs) during the spring abortion season and
   then implemented a master equation approach to translate SSFs into
   predictions of daily elk distribution for five plausible winter weather
   scenarios (from a heavy snow, to an extreme winter drought year). We
   predicted abortion events by combining elk distributions with empirical
   estimates of daily abortion rates, spatially varying elk seroprevelance
   and elk population counts.
   4. Our results reveal strong spatial variation in disease transmission
   risk at daily and annual scales that is strongly governed by variation
   in host movement in response to spring phenology. For example, in
   comparison with an average snow year, years with early snowmelt are
   predicted to have 64\% of the abortions occurring on feedgrounds shift
   to occurring on mainly public lands, and to a lesser extent on private
   lands.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Linking mechanistic models of host
   movement with disease dynamics leads to a novel bridge between movement
   and disease ecology. Our analysis framework offers new avenues for
   predicting disease spread, while providing managers tools to proactively
   mitigate risks posed by mobile disease hosts. More broadly, we
   demonstrate how mechanistic movement models can provide predictions of
   ecological conditions that are consistent with climate change but may be
   more extreme than has been observed historically.}},

Abstract = {{Tracking the sources of particulate organic matter (POM) exported from
   catchments is important to understand the transfer of energy from soils
   to oceans. The suitability of investigating the molecular composition of
   POM by thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation using
   tetramethylammonium hydroxide directly coupled to gas chromatography and
   mass spectrometry is presented. The results of this
   molecular-fingerprint approach were compared with previously published
   elemental (\%C, \%N) and isotopic data (delta C-13, delta N-15) acquired
   in a nested headwater catchment in the Piedmont region, eastern United
   States of America (12 and 79 ha). The concordance between these results
   highlights the effectiveness of this molecular tool as a valuable method
   for source fingerprinting of POM. It emphasizes litter as the main
   source of exported POM at the upstream location (80 +/- 14 \%), with an
   increasing proportion of streambed (SBed) sediment remobilization
   downstream (42 +/- 29 \%), specifically during events characterized by
   high rainfall amounts. At the upstream location, the source of POM seems
   to be controlled by the maximum and median hourly rainfall intensity. An
   added value of this method is to directly investigate chemical
   biomarkers and to mine their distributions in terms of biogeochemical
   functioning of an ecosystem. In this catchment, the distribution of
   plant-derived biomarkers characterizing lignin, cutin and suberin inputs
   were similar in SBed and litter, while the proportion of microbial
   markers was 4 times higher in SBed than in litter. These results
   indicate that SBed OM was largely from plant litter that has been
   processed by the aquatic microbial community.}},

Title = {{Vulnerability to sea level rise: A novel local-scale indicator-based
   assessment methodology and application to eight beaches in Shoalhaven,
   Australia}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{85}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Vulnerability of a socio-ecological system to one or more climatic
   hazards depends on climatic, geophysical, socio-economic and
   institutional factors. In addition, vulnerability is a scale- and
   place-dependent concept. While decision-making on adaptation is often
   made by local government, only a small number of local-scale assessments
   have been conducted. When indicators are used, global utility functions
   based on additive or multiplicative aggregation implicitly assume
   complete compensation between indicators, implying that one source of
   vulnerability (e.g., proximity to the sea) can always be compensated for
   by an advantage in another source (e.g., strong social or economic
   capital) when evidence shows that this is not always the case.
   This paper presents an indicator-based assessment of vulnerability of
   eight beaches in Shoalhaven, New South Wales, that are especially
   exposed to sea level rise. Its goal is twofold. First, it illustrates
   how indicator-based vulnerability assessments can be applied at a local
   scale and not just sectoral, regional and national scales with the aim
   of informing local government adaptation planning and resource
   allocation. In the process, models operationalising the concepts of
   exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity are developed for two valued
   attributes identified through discussions with the local council, namely
   the well-being of beach residents and the well-being of users of
   infrastructure systems located at the beaches.
   Second, the paper studies, for the first time, the way outranking
   procedures can be applied in real-life vulnerability assessments as a
   form of data aggregation that better reflects the non-compensatory
   nature of many vulnerability indicators. The strengths and weaknesses of
   the outranking approach are discussed, especially the extent to which
   the concepts of preference, indifference and dominance thresholds can be
   conveyed to, and their values elicited from, stakeholders.}},

Title = {{Testing the ecoacoustics event detection and identification (EEDI)
   approach on Mediterranean soundscapes}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{698-715}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The Ecoacoustic Event Detection and Identification (EEDI) system is a
   recent methodology to investigate structure and dynamic of soundscapes.
   In this study, EEDI has been re-engineered by adding to the Acoustic
   Complexity Index (ACI) calculated for each temporal step (ACIf(t)) and
   to its evenness (ACIf(t) evenness), the evenness of ACI calculated along
   each frequency bin (ACIt(f) evenness), and upgrading the ecoacoustic
   code (EC) from a two-digit to a three-digit code, thus increasing the
   analytical resolution of EEDI. Furthermore, a new metric, the Acoustic
   Information (AI) index, is introduced which is obtained by multiplying
   the value of each EC by the number of Recording Minutes (RM) in which
   every EC occurs. The EEDI was tested in four localities within a
   Mediterranean landscape using Soundscape Explorer {[}Terrestrial]
   digital recorders.
   Based on 273,360 RMs, 436 ECs were detected from a field recording
   system active from December 2015 to November 2016. The number of ECs and
   AI values increased in late winter and early spring, followed by a
   reduction in late spring and summer. A second increase was observed in
   early autumn. Based on bird phenology, non-significant differences in
   the number of ECs were found between the breeding (395 ECs) and
   non-breeding season (417 ECs). The sequence of the ECs during night time
   resulted in significant differences from the sequence of the ECs during
   daytime, but the number of RMs and of AI values of ECs exclusive of day
   or night time resulted negligible. Hourly abundance of ECs and the
   associated Al showed a similar sequence for all the localities,
   confirming a common daily pattern in soundscape organization. According
   to the way in which ECs are distributed along the 24 h, the first
   hundred more frequent ECs were aggregated into seven major patterns:
   some ECs have a dominant distribution around sunrise, whereas others
   prevail at midday or at night.
   EEDI provides a visual representation of each recording day (240 RMs) in
   an Euclidean space delimited by ACIf(t) (x), ACIf(t) evenness (y) and
   ACIt(f) evenness (z). An ``asymptotical like{''} distribution that
   occurs during rain or wind events, and a ``shower jet like{''}
   distribution that occurs when biophonies are dominant, are the two major
   patterns that were discovered.
   The ecoacoustic codes EC000, EC999, EC997, EC476, and EC271, have been
   utilized after their identification, to classify and analyze ecoacoustic
   events as an example of the capacity of EEDI.
   This holistic approach starting with detection of patterns delimited by
   the combination of ACI metrics associated with the AI, overcomes the
   usual procedure to first identify the sources and then determine the
   resulting patterns. The use of EEDI provides the potential to explore
   and to compare the characteristics of soundscapes with other
   environmental variables and represents an innovative and flexible
   ecological indicator.}},

   ecological restoration}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{991-998}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystems that exhibit alternative stable states are a prominent
   challenge for ecological restoration. So far, alternative stable states
   have been addressed from two different angles: community assembly
   studies, which focus on species and their interactions, and regime shift
   studies, which focus on changes in ecosystem states following
   environmental change. Here, we propose a synthetic perspective that
   merges the community assembly with the regime shift approach to
   effectively inform restoration of ecosystems exhibiting alternative
   stable states. We show that the community assembly and the regime shift
   approaches have emphasized different aspects of alternative stable
   states (i.e., coarse vs fine resolutions of the focal state variable,
   different sets of feedback mechanisms, and small vs large spatial
   scales), and consequently have different limitations that influence
   restoration strategies. Using a simple mathematical model, we illustrate
   that a more explicit consideration of species identity and composition
   (i.e., the community assembly approach) can improve our ability to
   understand regime shifts and restore degraded ecosystems. Finally, we
   highlight two case studies in which such merging can bring novel
   insights into alternative stable states and ecological restoration.
   Understanding the relevant aspects of community assembly (biotic
   interactions and species identity) will lead to more informed decisions
   that target future restoration and the prediction of regime shifts in
   response to global environmental change.}},

Title = {{Benefit relevant indicators: Ecosystem services measures that link
   ecological and social outcomes}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{1262-1272}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing movement in government, environmental non
   -governmental organizations and the private sector to include ecosystem
   services in decision making. Adding ecosystem services into assessments
   implies measuring how much a change in ecological conditions affects
   people, social benefit, or value to society. Despite consensus around
   the general merit of accounting for ecosystem services, systematic
   guidance on what to measure and how is lacking. Current ecosystem
   services assessments often resort to biophysical proxies (e.g., area of
   wetland in a floodplain) or even disregard services that seem difficult
   to measure. Valuation, an important tool for assessing trade-offs and
   comparing outcomes, is also frequently omitted due to lack of data on
   social preferences, lack of expertise with valuation methods, or
   mistrust of valuation methods for non-market services.
   To address these shortcomings, we propose the use of a new type of
   indicator that explicitly reflects an ecosystem's capacity to provide
   benefits to society, ensuring that ecosystem services assessments
   measure outcomes that are demonstrably and directly relevant to human
   welfare. We call these Benefit-relevant indicators (BRIs) and describe a
   process for developing them using causal chains that link management
   decisions through ecological responses to effects on human well-being.
   BRIs identify what is valued and by whom, but stop short of valuation. A
   BRI for the ability of wetlands to ameliorate flooding would connect
   measures of the quantity and quality of wetland in a floodplain, as
   affected by wetlands management decisions, to the number of people or
   properties downstream that are vulnerable to flooding. BRIs can support
   monetary or non-monetary valuation, but are particularly useful when
   valuation will not be conducted; in such cases they serve as stand-alone
   measures of ``what is valued{''} by particular beneficiaries. BRIs are
   valid measures of ecosystem services in that they are directly linked to
   human well-being. Flexibility in the development of BRIs helps to ensure
   that they are broadly applicable across practitioner and stakeholder
   communities and decision contexts.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{New indices - modified hazard quotient (m HQ) and ecological
   contamination index (ECI) -were developed for the evaluation of heavy
   metals contamination of sediment. Sequential extraction method was
   employed to determine the levels of cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper
   (Cu), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) in subtidal sediment samples from
   tropical ecosystems off the Gulf of Guinea. The results were used to
   assess the degree of contamination and estimate the extent of
   anthropogenic inputs from industrial activities. Results indicated that
   the concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb ranged from 4.33 -5.67,
   11.12-28.52, 30.26-43.72, 2.02-2.60 and 162.0-190.37 mg/kg dw,
   respectively. The mean metal levels did not show significant variations
   among study sites during the wet and dry seasons. Spatial distribution
   and severity of sediment-associated contamination by heavy metals based
   on the newly developed indices (m HQ and ECI) were in good agreement
   with existing pollution indices and followed the descending sequence:
   Cd>Pb>Cu>Cr>Ni. Contamination severity index, mean hazard quotient and
   modified risk assessment code were also used to evaluate the
   sediment-heavy metal contamination, which generally indicated medium
   risk contamination of the investigated ecosystems. Aquatic pollution
   indicators (potential contamination index, ECI, hazard quotients, m HQ)
   revealed significant anthropogenic contamination by Cd and Pb, while Cr,
   Cu and Ni showed relatively low degree of contamination. Potential
   contamination index (PCI) generally followed the sequence
   Cd>Pb>Cu>Cr>Ni. A comparison of newly proposed indices with existing
   pollution indices revealed very good agreement. The contamination trends
   derived from the new indices were consistent and took into consideration
   site specificity, toxicity and a three-tier effect levels (threshold,
   mid-range and extreme effects guideline values) that support their
   reliability in evaluating contaminated aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2018

Title = {{Modelling unbiased dispersal kernels over continuous space by accounting

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{331-339}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Although a key demographic trait determining the spatial dynamics of
   wild populations, dispersal is notoriously difficult to estimate in the
   field. Indeed, dispersal distances obtained from the monitoring of
   marked individuals typically lead to biased estimations of dispersal
   kernels as a consequence of (i) restricted spatial scale of the study
   areas compared to species potential dispersal and (ii) heterogeneity in
   marking and observation efforts and therefore in detection probability
   across space.
   2. Here, we propose a novel method to circumvent these issues that does
   not require data on observation effort per se, to correct for the
   variability in detection of marked individuals across space. Observed
   dispersal events were weighted by the distribution of departure points
   and an eroded spatial window approach was applied so as to deal with
   border effect. We conducted a set of simulations which indicated that
   our method was successful in correcting the effect of spatially
   heterogeneous detectability and produce unbiased dispersal kernels.
   3. We applied this method to a real dataset on the Montagu's harrier (>
   5,000 chicks tagged), providing c. 6,000 resightings collected in entire
   France by a network of 1,200 volunteers within a citizen-science
   programme. The median dispersal distance observed was 32 km (range:
   0.1-627 km). Once corrected for spatial heterogeneity in marking and
   observation efforts and border effect, the modelled dispersal kernel
   indicated a median dispersal distance of 78-123 km depending on the
   spatial scale considered (constrained within French borders or not,
   respectively).
   4. Synthesis and applications: The current rise of citizen-science
   programmes is likely to stretch our estimate of the ecologically
   relevant spatial scale at which dispersal takes place for many taxa. Our
   method is particularly suited for such large-scale data that typically
   suffer from high spatial heterogeneity in marking and observation
   efforts and offers the possibility to derive unbiased dispersal kernels,
   a key component for modelling population dynamics and species
   distribution in a context of environmental change. Currently, our method
   assumes homogeneity in both habitat and dispersal behaviour across
   individuals. We discuss, however, how to relax these hypotheses to
   further investigate the effect of, e.g. local conspecific density or
   habitat quality on dispersal propensity.}},

Title = {{Accounting for uncertainty in duplicate identification and group size

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{354-362}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) surveys with two independent
   observers are widely used to estimate wildlife population abundance. The
   analysis relies on accurate identification of duplicate sightings common
   to both observers, and correct judgements of group size, both of which
   are hard to achieve for species that exhibit complex grouping patterns.
   2. In this paper, we examine the impact of these sources of uncertainty
   on bias and precision of abundance estimates, using a case study of 22
   aerial surveys of common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in the Hauraki
   Gulf, New Zealand. We develop a novel probabilistic method to identify
   duplicate observations, and account for various sources of uncertainty
   using a simulation-intensive approach.
   3. For our case study, identifying duplicates using reasonable but
   arbitrary thresholds of time and angle discrepancies created a range of
   abundance estimates differing by up to 20\%, whereas our novel
   threshold-free probabilistic analysis returned an estimate roughly
   central to this range. Uncertainty in group size made a smaller impact
   of up to 5\% on abundance estimates. All analysis choices returned
   similar values for the coefficient of variation, from 20 to 23\%.
   4. Generating robust estimates of abundance, and accounting for all
   associated sources of uncertainty, is critical for informing
   conservation management. Our novel approach provides a way to eliminate
   arbitrary decisions associated with MRDS, and account for a wider range
   of uncertainties. Our method allows for the reliable application of MRDS
   to a wider range of terrestrial and marine species, and will be a useful
   tool for producing robust abundance estimates for species that exhibit
   complex grouping patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Raptors are emblematic species of high conservation value and
   significant ecological role. Their conservation is of particular
   importance and it relies on the conservation of their habitats and the
   constant monitoring of their dynamics. In the current study we
   investigate land cover changes over the period 2001-2011, in one of the
   most important reserves for raptor conservation in Europe, the
   Dadia-Lefldmi-Soufli Forest National Park. Very high and high spatial
   resolution satellite data were integrated in a single analysis, in order
   to exploit the high spatial accuracy of the former and the high temporal
   and spectral resolution of the latter. The results suggest that the
   applied method increases the overall accuracy of the mapping product
   from 73\% to 89\%, providing a tool to land managers and
   conservationists to study landscape dynamics and guide wildlife
   management. The analysis of land use changes revealed that wildfires of
   high intensity and large extent, constitute a new threat for the
   ecological integrity of the reserve. If the currently observed trend of
   wildfire behavior in Greece and southern Europe continues it is likely
   to affect the core zones of forest reserve, which consist primarily by
   dense forests with high fuel load, with detrimental effects for
   wildlife. The most important land cover change observed is the
   significant reduction of open areas, which form the main hunting areas
   for raptors. Open areas appear to be encroached by forest, leading to
   loss of heterogeneity which has been reported to be associated with high
   biodiversity. The results reveal the need for more active management
   measures that would decrease the risk of large stand replacing fires and
   would ensure a suitable landscape structure for raptors.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of species under climate change relies on accurate
   predictions of species ranges under current and future climate
   conditions. To date, modelling studies have focused primarily on how
   changes in long-term averaged climate conditions are likely to influence
   species distributions with much less attention paid to the potential
   effect of extreme events such as droughts and heatwaves which are
   expected to increase in frequency over coming decades. In this study we
   explore the benefits of tailoring predictor variables to the specific
   physiological constraints of species, or groups of species. We show how
   utilizing spatial predictors of extreme temperature and water
   availability (heat-waves and droughts), derived from high-temporal
   resolution, long-term weather records, provides categorically different
   predictions about the future (2070) distribution of suitable
   environments for 188 mammal species across different biomes (from arid
   zones to tropical environments) covering the whole of continental
   Australia. Models based on long-term averages-only and extreme
   conditions-only showed similarly high predictive performance tested by
   hold-out cross-validation on current data, and yet some predicted
   dramatically different future geographic ranges for the same species
   under 2070 climate scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of
   accounting for extreme conditions/events by identifying areas in the
   landscape where species may cope with average conditions, but cannot
   persist under extreme conditions known or predicted to occur there. Our
   approach provides an important step toward identifying the location of
   climate change refuges and danger zones that goes beyond the current
   standard of extrapolating long-term climate averages.}},

Abstract = {{The vegetation of Santa Catalina Island has been significantly
   transformed through a history of introduction of exotic plant species
   and disturbance by large introduced herbivores. Many of these
   disturbances have been reduced in recent decades, using measures such as
   carefully controlling the number of bison and removing cattle, sheep,
   feral pigs, and goats. The success of subsequent vegetation restoration
   actions depends on the choice of the right plant community for a
   location, which may not be obvious for an island with extensive areas
   dominated by exotic species. Environmental niche modeling is an approach
   to re-create the spatial distribution of habitat types for such a
   purpose. Such models, however, often require both presence and absence
   data to be meaningful, while in this scenario absence is misleading
   because it may reflect a long history of disturbance. Maximum entropy
   modeling is a technique to model species distributions with
   presence-only data that has been shown to produce accurate results. We
   used this modeling tool to model the environmental niche for distinct
   vegetation types, conceptualized as potential natural vegetation, on
   Catalina Island as a means to predict locations where restoration
   actions would be most successful and to predict potential natural
   vegetation prior to anthropogenic disturbance. Using an existing
   vegetation map, we extracted random points from within the polygons
   defining each native vegetation type. We then modeled the habitat
   suitability for each habitat using high-resolution environmental data
   that included elevation, aspect, hillshade, northeastness, slope, solar
   radiation, and topographic wetness index. The resulting models were
   combined to produce a map of potential natural vegetation. A 1977 map of
   potential natural vegetation included 4 vegetation types (woodland,
   chaparral, scrub, and grassland) to which we compared our results. Our
   new model of potential natural vegetation has high spatial complexity
   and high resolution. It also shows naturalistic responses to topography
   that are consistent with the broad patterns mapped in 1977 while
   providing fine-scale resolution to inform restoration efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: We provide the first European-scale geospatial training set
   relating the charcoal signal in surface lake sediments to fire
   parameters (number, intensity and area) recorded by satellite moderate
   resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. Our calibration is
   intended for quantitative reconstructions of key fire-regime parameters
   by using sediment sequences of microscopic (MIC from pollen slides,
   particles 10-500 mu m) and macroscopic charcoal (MAC from sieves,
   particles > 100 mu m).
   Location: North-south and east-west transects across Europe, covering
   the mediterranean, temperate, alpine, boreal and steppe biomes.
   Time period: Lake sediments and MODIS active fire and burned area
   products were collected for the years 2012-2015.
   Methods: Cylinder sediment traps were installed in lakes to annually
   collect charcoal particles in sediments. We quantitatively assessed the
   relationships between MIC and MAC influx (particles/cm(2)/year) and the
   MODIS-derived products to identify source areas of charcoal and the
   extent to which lake-sediment charcoal is linked to fire parameters
   across the continent.
   Results: Source area of sedimentary charcoal was estimated to a 40-km
   radius around sites for both MIC and MAC particles. Fires occurred in
   grasslands and in forests, with grass morphotypes of MAC accurately
   reflecting the burned fuel-type. Despite the lack of local fires around
   the sites, MAC influx levels reached those reported for local fires.
   Both MIC and MAC showed strong and highly significant relationships with
   the MODIS-derived fire parameters, as well as with climatic variation
   along a latitudinal temperature gradient.
   Main conclusions: MIC and MAC are suited to quantitatively
   reconstructing fire number and fire intensity on a regional scale.
   However, burned area may only be estimated using MAC. Local fires may be
   identified by using several lines of evidence, e.g. analysis of large
   particles (> 600 mu m), magnetic susceptibility and sedimentological
   data. Our results offer new insights and applications to quantitatively
   reconstruct fires and to interpret available sedimentary charcoal
   records.}},

Abstract = {{Wilderness areas are ecologically intact landscapes predominantly free
   of human uses, especially industrial-scale activities that result in
   substantial biophysical disturbance. This definition does not exclude
   land and resource use by local communities who depend on such areas for
   subsistence and bio-cultural connections. Wilderness areas are important
   for biodiversity conservation and sustain key ecological processes and
   ecosystem services that underpin planetary life-support systems. Despite
   these widely recognized benefits and values of wilderness, they are
   insufficiently protected and are consequently being rapidly eroded.
   There are increasing calls for multilateral environmental agreements to
   make a greater and more systematic contribution to wilderness
   conservation before it is too late. We created a global map of remaining
   terrestrial wilderness following the established last-of-the-wild
   method, which identifies the 10\% of areas with the lowest human
   pressure within each of Earth's 62 biogeographic realms and identifies
   the 10 largest contiguous areas and all contiguous areas > 10,000 km(2).
   We used our map to assess wilderness coverage by the World Heritage
   Convention and to identify gaps in coverage. We then identified large
   nationally designated protected areas with good wilderness coverage
   within these gaps. One-quarter of natural and mixed (i.e., sites of both
   natural and cultural value) World Heritage Sites (WHS) contained
   wilderness (total of 545,307 km2), which is approximately 1.8\% of the
   world's wilderness extent. Many WHS had excellent wilderness coverage,
   for example, the Okavango Delta in Botswana (11,914 km(2)) and the
   Central Suriname Nature Reserve (16,029 km(2)). However, 22 (35\%) of
   the world's terrestrial biorealms had no wilderness representation
   within WHS. We identified 840 protected areas of > 500 km(2) that were
   predominantly wilderness (> 50\% of their area) and represented 18 of
   the 22 missing biorealms. These areas offer a starting point for
   assessing the potential for the designation of new WHSs that could help
   increase wilderness representation on the World Heritage list. We urge
   the World Heritage Convention to ensure that the ecological integrity
   and outstanding universal value of existing WHS with wilderness values
   are preserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over half of globally threatened animal species have experienced rapid
   geographic range loss. Identifying the parts of species' distributions
   most vulnerable to local extinction would benefit conservation planning.
   However, previous studies give little consensus on whether ranges
   decline to the core or edge. We built on previous work by using
   empirical data to examine the position of recent local extinctions
   within species' geographic ranges, address range position as a
   continuum, and explore the influence of environmental factors. We
   aggregated point-locality data for 125 Galliform species from across the
   Palearctic and Indo-Malaya into equal-area half-degree grid cells and
   used a multispecies dynamic Bayesian occupancy model to estimate rates
   of local extinctions. Our model provides a novel approach to identify
   loss of populations from within species ranges. We investigated the
   relationship between extinction rates and distance from range edge by
   examining whether patterns were consistent across biogeographic realm
   and different categories of land use. In the Palearctic, local
   extinctions occurred closer to the range edge than range core in both
   unconverted and human-dominated landscapes. In Indo-Malaya, no pattern
   was found for unconverted landscapes, but in human-dominated landscapes
   extinctions tended to occur closer to the core than the edge. Our

Journal = {{DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{219-232}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Knowledge of expanding and contracting ranges is critical for
   monitoring invasions and assessing conservation status, yet reliable
   data on distributional trends are lacking for most freshwater species.
   We developed a quantitative technique to detect the sign (expansion or
   contraction) and functional form of range-size changes for freshwater
   species based on collections data, while accounting for possible biases
   due to variable collection effort. We applied this technique to quantify
   stream-fish range expansions and contractions in a highly invaded river
   system.
   Location: Upper and middle New River (UMNR) basin, Appalachian
   Mountains, USA.
   Methods: We compiled a 77-year stream-fish collections dataset
   partitioned into ten time periods. To account for variable collection
   effort among time periods, we aggregated the collections into 100
   watersheds and expressed a species' range size as detections per
   watershed (HUC) sampled (DPHS). We regressed DPHS against time by
   species and used an information-theoretic approach to compare linear and
   nonlinear functional forms fitted to the data points and to classify
   each species as spreader, stable or decliner.
   Results: We analysed changes in range size for 74 UMNR fishes, including
   35 native and 39 established introduced species. We classified the
   majority (51\%) of introduced species as spreaders, compared to 31\% of
   natives. An exponential functional form fits best for 84\% of spreaders.
   Three natives were among the most rapid spreaders. All four decliners
   were New River natives.
   Main conclusions: Our DPHS-based approach facilitated quantitative
   analyses of distributional trends for stream fishes based on collections
   data. Partitioning the dataset into multiple time periods allowed us to
   distinguish long-term trends from population fluctuations and to examine
   nonlinear forms of spread. Our framework sets the stage for further
   study of drivers of stream-fish invasions and declines in the UMNR and
   is widely transferable to other freshwater taxa and geographic regions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose to extend methods for agricultural impact
   assessment to study the adaptations that agricultural producers are
   likely to consider in response to climate change - i.e., the use of
   different combinations of crop or livestock species and associated
   changes in management. Analysis of these kinds of adaptations, referred
   to here as ``between-system adaptations{''} - requires estimates of the
   counterfactual productivity and cost of production for prospective
   systems that are not observable in the locations where they could be
   used. We propose two methods that we call simulation matching and
   propensity score matching. We apply and compare the results of these
   methods in a study of wheat based systems in the U.S. Pacific Northwest.
   We find substantial differences between the two methods, but these
   differences do not appear to be systematic or associated with
   characteristics of the systems. We conclude that the method used for
   estimating the productivity of the new system introduces an element of
   uncertainty into adaptation analysis, in addition to the other data,
   model and scenario uncertainties. Further research is warranted to
   evaluate alternative methods for analysis of between-system adaptations

Volume = {{253}},

Abstract = {{Extensive research has shown that climate change will impact the
   distribution and outbreak potential of invertebrate pests in broad-acre
   crops. However, much less attention has been placed on translating these
   likely changes in pest outbreak frequency into practical management
   options for growers. Dryland grain production systems are generally
   predicted to be vulnerable to the effects of climate change. An initial
   step in understanding changes to outbreak potential of different pests
   is to describe the spatial distribution of different species and
   communities. Using a bioclimatic modelling approach, we demonstrate how
   general patterns of distribution for four major invertebrate pests of
   Australian dryland grain production systems are likely to be altered by
   climate change. While such models are useful for predicting the direct
   impacts of climate change on potential species distributions, they are
   less useful for assessing pest outbreak frequency from direct or
   indirect changes. In light of this, we explore different tools that can
   be used to support adaptive management by farmers to limit the impact of
   induced pest outbreaks. Primarily, research to increase available
   information of indirect impacts on the pest species and the communities
   they interact with, including their natural enemies, is required to
   extend models of pest outbreak potential. Further, incorporation of
   pests into global crop models combined with monitoring for existing
   pests and surveillance for new pests is critical for future pest
   management decision-making. For natural enemies, generalizations around
   the impact of climate change and flow on effects for pest control
   services need to be attempted now. The knowledge of potential management
   interventions is needed by farmers to support improved management
   decisions in the short-term, but in some cases will also facilitate
   adaption to climate change in the long-term. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This article uses an ecological economics approach to analyse tensions
   surrounding efforts to phase out mercury in Indonesia's artisanal and
   small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sector, among the largest sources of
   mercury pollution worldwide. Many scholars and environmental activists
   have long hoped that global restrictions in mercury trade would drive up
   mercury prices and decrease mercury use and pollution in ASGM. However,
   in Indonesia, despite global mercury trade restrictions, recent
   increases in domestic mercury supplies through new cinnabar mining
   developments have made mercury less expensive and more available,
   destabilizing efforts at reducing mercury use. This article discusses
   implications of domestic cinnabar mining for controlling mercury in
   Indonesia's ASGM sector, highlighting obstacles to implementing the
   Minamata Convention, a treaty that aims to restrict mercury use. We link
   discussion of mercury mining to other socioeconomic processes, labour
   relations and power dynamics shaping mercury use in gold mining and
   hindering collectivised mercury-free technology uptake. Examining new
   evidence regarding the social metabolism of a changing extractive

Abstract = {{This paper develops an Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare for Spain
   from 1970 to 2012 and seeks to update valuation approaches to a number

   recent decades; the costs of energy depletion and of climate change. The
   valuation implications in measuring present welfare have proven
   problematic, as both include future sustainability consequences arising
   from resource depletion and environmental impacts. This study includes a
   `transition cost' approach to energy depletion, a modified approach to
   costs of climate change and water pollution, and removes the cost of
   ozone depletion. The results illustrate that while GDP per capita
   increased significantly, the ISEW per capita shows a widening gap.
   Household labour contributes strongly, but income distribution, energy
   depletion and costs of climate change limit improvement. Sensitivity
   analysis shows that accumulating climate change costs and escalating
   energy depletion costs have significant effects. Nevertheless, the new
   valuation approaches do not alter conclusions that welfare has shown
   little improvement. The ISEW provides a useful alternative to current
   indicators such as GDP subject to awareness of limitations. It is a

Abstract = {{The formalization of novel equations explicitly modelling the impact of
   extreme weather events into the crop model WOFOST (EMS: existing
   modelling solution; MMS: modified modelling solution) is proposed as a
   way to reduce the uncertainty in estimations of crop yield. A
   sensitivity analysis (SA) was performed to assess the effect of changing
   parameters values on the yield simulated by the model (both EMS and MMS)
   for different crops (winter and durum wheat, winter barley, maize,
   sunflower) grown under a variety of conditions (including future climate
   realisations) in Europe. A two-step SA was performed using global
   techniques: the Morris screening method for qualitative ranking of
   parameters was first used, followed by the eFAST variance-based method,
   which attributes portions of variance in the model output to each
   parameter.
   The results showed that the parameters related to the partitioning of
   assimilates to storage organs (FOTB) and to the conversion efficiency of
   photosynthates into storage organs (CVO) generally affected considerably
   the simulated yield (also underlying tight correlation with this
   output), whereas the parameters involved with respiration rate (Q10) or
   specific leaf area (SLA) became influential in case of unfavourable
   weather conditions. Major differences between EMS and MMS (which
   includes a component simulating the impact of extreme weather events)
   emerged in extreme cases of crop failure triggered by markedly negative
   minimum temperatures. With few exceptions, the two SA methods revealed
   the same parameter ranking. We argue that the SA performed in this study
   can be useful in the design of crop modelling studies and in the
   implementation of crop yield forecasting systems in Europe. (C) 2017

Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Structural and functional changes in a sandy beach ecosystem in the
   southwestern Atlantic (Barra del Chuy, Uruguay) were assessed by
   contrasting four Ecopath trophic models and performing temporal dynamic
   simulations using Ecosim. Each model (1982, 1989, 1996 and 2012)
   represents a historical period of a clam fishery in which regulatory
   structure, management tools and resource status varied substantially.
   The results showed that this land-ocean interface experienced
   significant changes reflected at the population and ecosystem levels,
   owing to a combined effect of fishing and climate variability. Most
   system biomass (excluding phytoplankton and detritus) consisted of
   benthic invertebrates. Phytoplankton increased significantly over time,
   whereas the biomass of benthic macrofaunal components varied among the
   periods due to bottom-up processes, mass mortalities of the harvested
   clams and fishing intensity. Major fishing impacts on the targeted clam
   and mass mortalities occurred concurrently with low phytoplankton
   biomass, and clam recovery occurred in the absence of harvesting and
   increasing primary production. Ecosystem-level attributes (e.g., Total
   System Throughput, Ascendency) showed considerable temporal
   fluctuations, which were primarily related to changes in system
   productivity associated with a climatic shift from a cold phase to a
   warm phase and increasing onshore winds. An analysis of robustness and
   order showed an ecosystem state lacking the flexibility to adapt to new
   perturbations. Dynamic simulations showed the prominent bottom-up role
   of environmental variability on ecosystem function and structure.
   Temporal dynamics is conducted by changes in primary production forced
   mainly by temperature patterns. The concurrent role of climate
   variations and fishing explained the long-term dynamics of this
   ecosystem, suggesting that sandy beaches are fragile social-ecological
   systems whose services are increasingly threatened by long-lasting

   system, additional parameters such as water temperature and nutrient
   loading provide more critical ecological value for organisms than
   ensuring a constant minimum release. A new modelling methodology,
   utilizing a cascading hierarchical approach, is proposed and tested on a
   614 km(2) headwater basin in central Idaho, USA. Application of the
   methodology illustrates that below large dams the river discharge
   becomes independent of the seasonal hydrology and specifying the
   discharge alone is insufficient for evaluating ecosystem response.
   Upstream reservoirs interrupt the watershed continuum and internally
   modify the thermal, chemical, and biological properties of water prior
   to release into a downstream river. These water properties depend on the
   annual hydrologic regime, characteristics of the reservoir and the
   offtake strategies, offtake structure depth, dam discharge, and the
   water column thermal stratification. This study describes the use of
   climatically driven hydrologic forcing and variable dam operations in a
   coupled reservoir-river system to optimize river ecosystem health by
   linking physical processes with in situ observations and incorporating
   multi-trophic species requirements. Such an approach can support
   real-time decision making on existing reservoir-river systems and
   provide a virtual means of evaluating ecosystem impacts prior to
   disturbance from new dam construction or implementation of restoration
   activities in a watershed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dinitrogen fixation (NF) by marine cyanobacteria is an important pathway
   to replenish the oceanic bioavailable nitrogen inventory. Light is the
   key to modulating NF; however, field studies investigating the light
   response curve (NF-I curve) of NF rate and the effect of light on
   diazotrophderived nitrogen (DDN) net release are relatively sparse in
   the literature, hampering prediction using models. A dissolution method
   was applied using uncontaminated N-15(2) gas to examine how the light
   changes may influence the NF intensity and DDN net release in the
   oligotrophic ocean. Experiments were conducted at stations with
   diazotrophs dominated by filamentous cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp.
   in the western Pacific and the South China Sea. The effect of light on
   carbon fixation (CF) was measured in parallel using the C-13 tracer
   method specifically for a station characterized by Trichodesmium bloom.
   Both NF-I and CF-I curves showed a I-k (light saturation coefficient)
   range of 193 to 315 mu Em(-2) s(-1), with light saturation at around 400
   mu Em(-2) s(-1). The proportion of DDN net release ranged from similar
   to 6 to similar to 50 \%, suggesting an increasing trend as the light
   intensity decreased. At the Trichodesmium bloom station, we found that
   the CF/NF ratio was light-dependent and the ratio started to increase as
   light was lower than the carbon compensation point of 200 mu Em(-2)
   s(-1). Under low-light stress, Trichodesmium physiologically preferred
   to allocate more energy for CF to alleviate the intensive carbon
   consumption by respiration; thus, there is a metabolism tradeoff between
   CF and NF pathways. Results showed that shortterm (< 24 h) light change
   modulates the physiological state, which subsequently determined the C/N
   metabolism and DDN net release by Trichodesmium. Reallocation of energy
   associated with the variation in light intensity would be helpful for
   prediction of the global biogeochemical cycle of N by models involving
   Trichodesmium blooms.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. The aim of the research is to study the potential nesting sites of
   the Spanish sparrow (Passer hispaniolensis) on the northwest coast of
   Crimea. Methods. Material was compiled during 2016-2018. The generally
   accepted methods of road and foot route census study were applied.
   Nesting stations were explored: nests of storks, birds of prey and
   corvids, forest belts and reed beds. Results. On the basis of research,
   the presence of Passer hispaniolensis in the north-western Crimea, in
   particular, within the borders of the Lebyazhy Islands ({''}Swan
   Islands{''}) specially protected natural area, has been established. It
   is revealed that for nesting, this species of sparrow prefers the areas
   close to fields and is not often found in human settlements. During the
   nesting period, an increase in the number from 15 to 45 pairs was noted.
   The greatest number of breeding pairs of spanish sparrow is found in the
   nests of the white stork. Late arriving birds form colonies on trees in
   close proximity to stork nests.
   Conclusion. Nesting of Passer hispaniolensis is most likely due to
   changes in the hydrological regime and land use structure, since rice
   crop rotation (until 2014) has been replaced by other grain crops
   (barley, wheat) and tilled crops (sunflower, maize). Thus, at present,
   the breeding ornithofauna of the protected area is represented by 92

Abstract = {{The leading sector of the South of Russia is crop production and

   2005 to 2013 is provided by domestic and foreign meat imports which
   increased 3-fold. Methods. An analytical study on the state of animal

Abstract = {{It is often a challenge to predict the impact of ecosystem restoration

   Integrating sense of place with ecological metrics, a typology of

   Achieving coupled human-natural objectives thus requires evaluation of

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Conflict over water resources emerges from complex interactions among
   biophysical, social, and economic processes operating at multiple
   scales. Competing use of linked surface-groundwater (LSGW) resources is
   an excellent yet relatively unexplored example of such conflict. Dynamic
   circumstances surrounding the contested installation of a high capacity
   municipal well in southeastern Wisconsin were examined through the
   theoretical lens of adaptive governance using document analysis and
   open-ended key stakeholder interviews. A framework analysis method
   extracted 16 controlling variables from the qualitative data. These
   controlling variables were placed on a threshold matrix at their
   appropriate geospatial scale (Property, Watershed, State) and process
   domain (Biophysical, Economic, Social), which revealed several
   social-ecological feedbacks not currently addressed by management
   authorities. Three dynamic feedback loops were identified that explain
   the emergence and resolution of LSGW conflict in the case study area.
   Conflict emerged when processes driving new development in southeastern
   Wisconsin threatened to impact a highly valued groundwater dependent
   lake. Lake groups engaged in collective learning, utilized information
   networks, and displayed leadership to address the issue. However, lack
   of participatory avenues for dispute resolution at the scale of
   occurrence drove lake groups to challenge the regulatory authority of
   the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR). Through
   order-based legitimacy, legal resolution affected governance of LSGW
   resources across the state, but did little to address the underlying
   stakeholder values driving conflict. We conclude this system will
   continue to be subjected to ``legal back and forth,{''} recurrent
   conflict, and uncertainty for both environmental and developmental
   interests until a more participatory process is developed with
   regulatory authorities to resolve conflicts over LSGW.}},

   Gmelin, 1791? Progress in resolving translocation mortality}},
Journal = {{ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{219-232}},
Abstract = {{The Mediterranean ribbed limpet Patella ferruginea Gmelin, 1791 is the
   most endangered marine invertebrate listed in the EU Habitats Directive.
   A diversity of anthropic pressures have reduced its present-day
   distribution to a fraction of its former size. Perhaps surprisingly,
   this highly protected species has successfully established along
   man-made harbour breakwaters, resulting in serious complications when
   these structures have required modification or repair, often leading to
   costly impasses due to the legal status of the species. Attempts to move
   the limpets to other locations have resulted in unacceptably high
   mortality rates. This article describes the result of a field experiment
   where 97 P. ferruginea individuals were transported to a new site, using
   a technique which involved carefully moving the limpets whilst inactive
   (during low tide), still attached to their home scars on breakwater
   boulders. The results of this experiment were significantly positive,
   with 87 \% of all translocated limpets still alive 10 mo after the move,
   a mortality rate which compared favourably with that obtained for the
   existing control population at the receptor site. We propose that this
   method could be a practical solution to address the conflicts generated
   by this endangered species' preference for harbour constructs. We
   further propose that this method can be used as a management tool to
   enhance the species' survival prospects, by creating `stepping stones'
   of pockets of reproducing individuals that can connect currently
   fragmented populations to effect a population recovery of this
   threatened organism.}},

Abstract = {{Copper is a very common substance that occurs naturally in the
   environment and spreads through the environment through natural
   phenomena. Humans widely use copper. For instance it is applied in the
   industries and in agriculture. The production of copper has lifted over
   the last decades. Due to this, copper quantities in the environment have
   increased. This metal, the tea-coloured organic material found in soil
   and rivers and coastal waters, is not ecologically toxic to humans but
   it is somewhat toxic to fish and very toxic to phytoplankton{''} -- a
   fundamental link in the food chain. Natural humic substances and other
   copper-binding compounds may also greatly affect the toxicity and
   bioavailability of metals in rivers and coastal waters. When organic
   matter binds with metals, noted Professor Voelker, the metals often
   become less toxic. However, in environments such as groundwater, they
   may also become more mobile. Among widely used heavy metals, Cu(II) ions
   have received special attention due to its eco-toxic effect (i.e.,
   negative impacts on ecology and environment), bioaccumulation in food
   chain and its persistent in nature. Additionally, copper is most
   valuable substance, which is mostly washed away in wastewater and
   dissipate to environment resulting in economic loss. Cu(II) ions have
   major contribution, cause several adverse effects even at very low
   concentration such as an extreme mucosal bothering, hypertension,
   hepatic and renal harm, far reaching slender harm, gastrointestinal
   irritation, vomiting, irritation of the focal sensory system took after
   by dejection, and conceivable necrotic changes in the liver and kidneys.
   But human beings needs copper in the life circle, so for improving on
   the quality of copper cathode and saving energy, the analysis of the
   whole process of electrolytic copper production is needed. It indicates
   that the copper ion and acid ion concentration are the most important
   factors affecting the quality of copper cathode, however, the copper ion
   and acid ion concentration as major variables of objective function
   determined by accurate electrolyte temperature control. Therefore, in
   this paper, an improved differential evolution algorithm is proposed to
   optimize the multi-objective function, and the optimal solution set of
   the multi-objective problem is determined. Then, a new improved ideal
   point method is proposed based on the ideal point method. Finally, the
   optimal temperature and copper ion concentration are determined to
   optimize the electrolysis process. The optimal value of temperature is
   taken as the given value of the control system. The fuzzy adaptive PID
   algorithm is used for simulation analysis and experimental verification.
   The results show the correctness and feasibility of the algorithm under
   the background of low carbon energy saving appeal.}},

Journal = {{EKOLOJI}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{106}},

Abstract = {{Roads are one of the most important factors affecting the environmental
   life within an urban area. Roads physically replace wildlife habitat and
   often reduce life's quality nearby, fragment the remaining habitat, and
   cause increased mortality through vehicle collisions. Although road
   ecology is a growing field of study, relatively little of this research,
   and relatively few mitigation projects, has been done in urban
   landscapes. Road projects are generally intended to improve the economic
   and social welfare of people. But for all the positive aspects of road
   projects, they may also have significant negative impacts on nearby
   communities and the natural environment. Road ecology is the study of
   the ecological effects (both positive and negative) of roads and
   highways (public roads). These effects may include local effects, such
   as on noise, water pollution, habitat destruction/disturbance and local
   air quality; and wider effects such as habitat fragmentation, ecosystem
   degradation, and climate change from vehicle emissions. The design,
   construction and management of roads, parking, spatial distribution of
   the intersections and other related facilities as well as the design and
   regulation of vehicles can change their effect. Roads can have both
   negative and positive effects on air quality: a) Negative effects - Air
   pollution from fossil (and some biofuel) powered vehicles can occur
   wherever vehicles are used and are of particular concern in congested
   city street conditions and other low speed circumstances. Emissions
   include particulate emissions from diesel engines, volatile organic
   compounds, carbon monoxide and various other hazardous air pollutants
   including benzene. Concentrations of air pollutants and adverse
   respiratory health effects are greater near the road than at some
   distance away from the road. Road dust kicked up by vehicles may trigger
   allergic reactions. Carbon dioxide is non-toxic to humans but is a major
   greenhouse gas and motor vehicle emissions are an important contributor
   to the growth of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere and therefore to
   global warming; b) Positive effects - The construction of new roads
   which divert traffic from built-up areas can deliver improved air
   quality to the areas relieved of a significant amount of traffic.
   The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Study carried out for the
   development of the roads estimated that it would result in improved air
   quality in Beijing city centre. In this study, Combing the traffic
   characteristics at the intersection of urban road and the use of
   environmental protection facilities to set up an environmental data
   collection scheme at the intersection of urban road in Beijing, then
   combining the conditions of the facilities and the surrounding to
   determine the point of monitoring, frequency of monitoring, monitoring
   index and monitoring method environment was necessary. By analysing the
   concentration of particles at different monitoring points, the mean
   value and variance of the hourly concentration were compared and
   analysed. By further analysing, the correlation between particle
   concentration and traffic characteristics and fitting estimation of
   data, the spatial diffusion model of particulates at the intersection
   was established. Finally the distribution of particles at the
   intersection of urban roads is obtained. That is the distribution of
   particulate matter on the cross section of intersection was higher in
   the centre and then decreased to the two sides. The higher the
   concentration of particulate matter at the point near the intersection
   parking line, the greater the fluctuation. The fluctuation of particle
   concentration on the sidewalk is higher than that on the driveway. The
   regularity of PM2.5 in particulate matter is consistent with that of
   PM10 in particulate matter.}},

Abstract = {{Global environmental change is a pressing issue as evidenced by the rise
   of extreme weather conditions in many parts of the world, threatening
   the survival of vulnerable species and habitats. Effective monitoring of
   climatic and anthropogenic impacts is therefore critical to safeguarding
   ecosystems, and it would allow us to better understand their response to
   stressors and predict long-term impacts. Ecological networks provide a
   biomonitoring framework for examining the system-level response and
   functioning of an ecosystem, but have been, until recently, constrained
   by limited empirical data due to the laborious nature of their
   construction. Hence, most experimental designs have been confined to a
   single network or a small number of replicate networks, resulting in
   statistical uncertainty, low resolution, limited spatiotemporal scale
   and oversimplified assumptions.
   Advances in data sampling and curation methodologies, such as
   next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the Internet `Cloud', have
   facilitated the emergence of the `Big Data' phenomenon in Ecology,
   enabling the construction of ecological networks to be carried out
   effectively and efficiently. This provides to ecologists an excellent
   opportunity to expand the way they study ecological networks. In
   particular, highly replicated networks are now within our grasp if new
   NGS technologies are combined with machine learning to develop network
   building methods. A replicated network approach will allow temporal and
   spatial variations embedded in the data to be taken into consideration,
   overcoming the limitations in the current `single network' approach.
   We are still at the embryonic stage in exploring replicated networks,
   and with these new opportunities we also face new challenges. In this
   chapter, we discuss some of these challenges and highlight potential
   approaches that will help us build and analyse replicated networks to
   better understand how complex ecosystems operate, and the services and
   functioning they provide, paving the way for deciphering ecological big
   data reliably in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The Bologna Adaptation Plan, recently adopted by the City authorities to
   address the way the city of tomorrow will coop with climate change
   effects, suggests some effective measures to mitigate and reduce the
   impacts of urban heat island {[}UHI] and heat waves. Among the suggested
   actions, the greening of in-between spaces of the dense built
   environment and the introduction of new green surfaces (roof and
   facades) seem to offer interesting perspectives. The paper describes a
   research activity run by the Department of Architecture and the
   Municipality of Bologna to investigate how to define the best
   arrangement of greening with the aim to optimize the impact on outdoor
   comfort conditions. After analysing UHI, the related parameters and the
   mitigation effect produced by green surfaces, some demo sites were
   assumed as test bed to simulate different green layout. Models and
   simulations were performed using ENVIMET, a software recognized in the
   scientific literature as one of the most used tool at urban scale. Once
   boundary conditions were modelled and all the main features of the sites
   were properly modelled, simulations were run in order to compare
   different scenarios coming from a number of architectural, economical
   and practical constraints. The results are then compared with other
   factors, related to the social aspects, the use of the spaces, the
   perception of the sites, etc. Two demo sites were investigated in two of
   the densest parts of the city of Bologna and one in the historic city
   center was definitely implemented as a temporary initiative coupling the
   environmental challenge with the opportunity to socially reshape a
   fragment of old city. This micro-intervention represents the first
   experimental phase to strengthen the urban transition of the historic
   city center in the perspective to realize no-disruptive transformations
   of the open public spaces, improving the users' wellbeing and comfort.}},

Title = {{Transdisciplinary research as transformative space making for
   sustainability: enhancing propoor transformative agency in periurban
   contexts}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss how transdisciplinary development research
   (TDR), if approached in particular ways, can produce new knowledge and
   also foster deeper systemic changes in the knowledge system itself. We
   are concerned with systemic change that supports propoor sustainability
   transformations, and conceptualize the processes that contribute to this
   type of systemic change as ``transformative space making{''} (TSM).
   Transdisciplinary development research as TSM can generate possibilities
   for the integration of diverse knowledges into decision making, while
   also creating new opportunities for subaltern knowledges to achieve
   greater influence, through enhancing the transformative agency of the
   poor. Thus, our conceptualization goes beyond the idea of TDR for the
   cocreation of solution-oriented knowledge and recognizes the need to
   address structural injustices in knowledge systems. In TDR as TSM, the
   development of strategies to reveal power relations and navigate the
   politics of structural injustices becomes as important as refining the
   principles for robust collaborative knowledge production. To demonstrate
   the operationalization of TDR as TSM, we draw insights from our
   long-term involvement in TDR case studies of emergent environmental and
   health challenges in periurban contexts in India. We identify mechanisms
   that build legitimacy of propoor knowledges, while simultaneously
   creating ``readiness{''} to take advantage of opportunities for
   interventions to support change in policy and practice at multiple
   scales. We highlight the politics of alliance building both within and
   beyond the research team, arguing that attention to alliances is central
   to understanding the role of TDR in creating possibilities for
   transformative change. Finally, we argue that development research
   funding and commissioning agencies should pay attention to the
   mechanisms of TSM, alongside more recognized aspects of the planning,
   monitoring, and evaluation of TDR initiatives, in order to provide
   appropriate support for enhanced impact.}},

Title = {{New Zealand forest dynamics: a review of past and present vegetation
   responses to disturbance, and development of conceptual forest models}},
Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{87-106}},
Abstract = {{New Zealand forests have been and are shaped by a suite of disturbance
   types that vary in both their spatial extent and frequency of
   recurrence. Post-disturbance forest dynamics can be complex, non-linear,
   and involve multiple potential pathways depending on the nature of a
   perturbation, site conditions, and history. To capture the full range of
   spatial and temporal dynamics that shape forest ecosystems in a given
   area, we need to use and synthesise data sources that collectively
   capture all the relevant space-time scales. Here we integrate
   palaeoecological data with contemporary ecological evidence to build
   conceptual models describing post-disturbance dynamics in New Zealand
   (NZ) forests, encompassing large temporal and spatial scales. We review
   NZ forest disturbance regimes, focussing primarily on geological and
   geomorphic disturbances and weather-related disturbances but also
   considering the role of anthropogenic disturbance in shaping present-day
   NZ forests. Combining information from 58 studies of post-disturbance
   forest succession, we derive conceptual models and describe forest
   communities and forest change for conifer-angiosperm (including kauri
   forest), and beech forests (pure and mixed). The methods used in these
   studies included chronosequences, assessments of stand dynamics,
   longitudinal studies, palaeoecological reconstructions, and comparisons
   with historical observations; the temporal range of the studies extended
   from 15 years to millennia (c. 14 000 years BP). Our models capture the
   generalities of NZ forest dynamics, and can be used to support modelling
   and help guide decision-making in areas such as ecosystem restoration.
   However, this generality limits model resolution, meaning the models do
   not always portray the specific features of individual sites and
   successional pathways. There is, therefore, scope for more detailed,
   site-specific development and refinement of these frameworks. Finally,
   our models capture successional pathways and native plant communities
   from the past and present; invasive species, climate change, and exotic
   plant pathogens are likely to alter future forest dynamics in novel and
   unpredictable ways. These models, however, provide us with baselines
   against which to interpret and assess the impacts of such effects on
   forest composition and processes.}},

Pages = {{249-307}},
Abstract = {{Mango is one of the world's major tropical crops. In Reunion, the crop
   is plagued by pests, which have, over several decades, led to an
   over-reliance on agro-chemicals. These expensive treatments have limited
   efficacy, and negative effects on the environment are associated with
   health risks and ecological imbalances. In addition, these
   agroecosystems are not ecologically sustainable. That is why in recent
   years, Agroecological Crop Protection has been applied to mango
   production in Reunion. The Biophyto project (2012-2014) was co-designed
   between 2010 and 2011 and brought together a number of agricultural
   partners in a collective approach to the crisis. It was followed until
   2017 with further studies and experiments, as well as an extension phase
   to transfer knowledge to production areas. The experience broke new
   ground in Agroecological Crop Protection. A large quantity of data was
   collected which enabled comparisons between conventional and
   agroecological orchards. The results of this pioneering experience were
   very encouraging and the major points are (1) The Agroecological Crop
   Protection practices, mainly the suppression of pesticides, use of
   prophylaxis and permanent vegetal cover, which are the bases of
   conservation biological control, have been widely adopted by farmers.
   (2) These practices were found to reduce populations of pests and damage
   caused, e.g. mango bug, mealybugs, and had no negative impact on
   flowering level. (3) The treatment frequency index (TFI) decreased from
   22.4 before the project to 0.3 after the project. Production costs were
   reduced by 35\% without any loss of yield, except in a few specific
   circumstances. (4) The 124,001 arthropods identified from the 126,753
   arthropods collected in orchards belong to 4 classes, 23 orders, 215
   families, 451 genera and 797 morphotypes. The parasitoids formed the
   richest trophic group. (5) Bottom-up and top-down controls of
   biodiversity within a single community of arthropods were observed, and
   the role of ants, including invasive species, was quantified. (6) There
   was a negative effect of parasitoid diversity on the abundance of the
   Seychelles mealybug; the proportion of mango orchards in the landscape
   had a positive effect of on the abundance of South African citrus
   Thrips. (7) This experience also produced a large number of transfer
   assistance tools, particularly in the field of professional training.
   For example, a University Certificate of Professional Qualification
   (UCPQ) entitled ``Agroecological Crop Protection{''}, and aimed at
   growers, technicians and agricultural advisers, has been available since
   2013. (8) Other tools have been implemented by agricultural agencies and
   policy makers in order to facilitate the extension of agroecological
   practices: demonstration Dephy Ferme plots, a Biophyto Agri-Environment
   and Climate Measure and an Economic and Environmental Interest Group.}},

   Michigan boaters were willing to pay \$20.68 per year for AIS-prevention
   education, and total economic benefits at the population level were

   benefits far outweigh aggregated federal, state, and nonprofit costs by
   a wide margin. One-time exposure to AIS education materials and
   perception of AIS threats did not affect WTP. Long-term program impacts

Abstract = {{Forest fires have been regarded as a common phenomenon that has
   endangered forests throughout the history of the world. It changes the
   vegetation and forest floor suddenly and drastically. Kernel density
   estimation (KDE) is a frequently employed approach in order to transform
   historical wildfire data into a smooth and continuous 2-D surface during
   the spatiotemporal analysis of forest fires. The most crucial step in
   KDE is to choose the appropriate bandwidth parameter. In this study, a
   novel approach to obtain an appropriate smoothing parameter is
   introduced by adapting a powerful nonparametric spline fitting
   methodology, namely, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)
   into the KDE analysis of wildfires for the first time. Spatial and
   temporal analysis of wildfires between 2000 and 2017 in Mumcular Forest
   Subdistrict in Turkey is investigated by using the MARS-based KDE
   analysis. The proposed methodology in this paper produces a single
   smoothing parameter, instead of a range of values laying within a
   certain fixed interval, and it appears more robust to the positional
   uncertainties in the historical fire data, and more reliable than
   nonobjective visual analysis of maps generated by using alternating
   smoothing parameter values.}},

Title = {{Imagining transformative futures: participatory foresight for food
   systems change}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Transformations inherently involve systems change and because of the
   political nature of change, are subject to contestation. A potentially
   effective strategy to further transformative change that builds on
   interdisciplinary, multiactor, and multiscalepractices and values is the
   use of foresight. Foresight covers a wide range of methods to
   systematically investigate the future. Foresight exercises offer
   collaborative spaces and have the potential to conceptualize and even
   initiate transformative change. But there is no clear understanding of
   the possibilities and limitations of foresight in this regard. This
   explorative paper builds on foresight and sociology and interrogates the
   role of foresight in transformative change, building on four cases.
   These cases are embedded in different contexts and characterized by
   different organizational approaches and constellations of actors.
   Nevertheless, they share the common goal of transformative food systems
   change. By reflecting on the processes that play a role in foresight
   workshops, we analyze what created conditions for transformative change
   in these four empirical cases. We have operationalized these conditions
   by distinguishing layers in the structuring processes that influence the
   impact of the foresight process. Based on this analysis, we conclude
   that there are three roles, ranging from modest to more ambitious, that
   foresight can play in transformative change: preconceptualization of
   change; offering an avenue for the creation of new actor networks; and
   creation of concrete strategies with a high chance of implementation.
   Furthermore, contributing to future design of foresight processes for
   transformative change, we offer some crucial points to consider before
   designing foresight processes. These include the role of leading change
   makers (including researchers), the risk of co-option by more
   regime-driven actors, and the ability to attract stakeholders to
   participate.}},

Title = {{Safe operating space for humanity at a regional scale}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The planetary boundaries framework defined safe limits to human impacts
   on essential Earth-system processes. Subsequent assessments concluded
   that impacts exceed most delineated boundaries. Societal responses to
   these results have been insufficient to restore safety. One factor
   impeding effective action is differences in scale between planetary
   boundaries and national, regional, or local scales where many impacts
   and solutions originate. I have contributed toward a resolution by
   developing a regional scale framework and an approach to translate
   boundaries across spatial scales. I developed the framework for a county
   and river basin in the Pacific Northwest. The framework includes six
   state variables related to planetary scale analogues. Boundary
   translation can be achieved by aggregating hydrologic processes across
   scales. Because of greater process certainty and lower spatial
   heterogeneity at the regional scale, regional boundaries can be defined
   with more precision than global analogues. The region has exceeded five
   boundaries and is close to the remaining one. Effects of existing and
   proposed policies will be to exceed boundaries further. Likely
   consequences include irreversible degradation in river functions, severe
   water shortages, impaired water quality, human health impacts, and
   extinctions of iconic salmonids. In most cases, policy and enforcement
   mechanisms to restore conditions within regional boundaries are in
   place, but they have been ignored or misapplied. New initiatives with
   potential to restore safety are being pursued by indigenous peoples, who
   also are most directly affected by boundary transgression. By clearly
   delineating regional boundaries and identifying consequences of boundary
   transgression, this framework may complement indigenous efforts with
   policy imperatives for other stakeholders in the region.}},

Title = {{The ecology and economics of restoration: when, what, where, and how to
   restore ecosystems}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Restoration ecology has provided a suite of tools for accelerating the
   recovery of ecosystems damaged by drivers of global change. We review
   both the ecological and economic concepts developed in restoration
   ecology, and offer guidance on when, what, where, and how to restore
   ecosystems. For when to restore, we highlight the value of pursuing
   restoration early to prevent ecosystems from crossing tipping points and
   evaluating whether unassisted natural recovery is more cost-effective
   than active restoration. For what to restore, we encourage developing a
   restoration plan with stakeholders that will restore structural,
   compositional, and functional endpoints, and whose goal is a more
   resistant and resilient ecosystem. For where to restore, we emphasize
   developing restoration approaches that can address the impediment of
   rural poverty in the developing world and identifying and then balancing
   the ecosystems and regions in most need of restoration and those that
   are best positioned for restoration success. For the economics of how to
   restore ecosystems, we review the advantages and disadvantages of
   market-based strategies, such as environmental insurance bonds and
   Payment for Ecosystem Services frameworks, for funding, incentivizing,
   and ensuring restoration. For the ecology of how to restore ecosystems,
   we discuss the value of taking into account various ecological theories,
   site history, and landscape and aquascape perspectives, and employing a
   more inclusive toolbox that holistically considers alterations to
   propagule pressure, abiotic conditions, and biotic interactions.
   Finally, we draw attention to the importance of monitoring; adaptive
   management; stakeholder involvement; collaborations among scientists,
   managers, and practitioners; formal evaluation throughout the
   restoration process; and integrating ecological and economic concepts to
   maximize restoration success. We hope this overview of key ecological
   and economic concepts in restoration science sheds light on the
   discipline and facilitates restoring and maintaining the services and
   products provided by natural capital, thus improving human livelihoods
   and hope for posterity.}},

Title = {{Learning from collaborative research on sustainably managing fresh

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Since the mid-2000s, there has been increasing recognition of the
   promise of collaborative research and management for addressing complex
   issues in sustainably managing fresh water. A large variety of
   collaborative freshwater research and management processes is now
   evident around the world. However, how collective knowledge development,
   coproduction, or cocreation is carried out in an ethical manner is less
   well known. From the literature and our experiences as applied,
   transdisciplinary researchers and natural resource management
   practitioners, we seek to describe and explore these aspects of
   empirical cases of collaborative freshwater research and management.
   Drawing on cases from Indigenous community-based natural resource
   management in northern Australia, flood and drought risk management in
   Bulgaria, water management and climate change adaptation in the Pacific,
   and regional catchment and estuary management in Victoria and New South
   Wales in Australia, we identify lessons to support improved
   collaborative sustainable freshwater management research and practice.
   Cocreation represents an emerging approach to participation and
   collaboration in freshwater management research-practice and can be seen
   to constitute four interlinked and iterative phases: coinitiation,
   codesign, coimplementation, and coevaluation. For freshwater researchers
   and managers and their collaborators, paying attention to these phases
   and the ethical dilemmas that arise within each phase will support the
   cocreation of more effective and ethical research-practice through:
   sensitizing collaborators to the need for reflexivity in
   research-practice, proposing action research codesign as a method for
   managing emergent questions and outcomes, and supporting more equitable
   outcomes for collaborators through an emphasis on coevaluation and
   collaborative articulation of the links between research outputs and
   practice outcomes.}},

Title = {{Using futures methods to create transformative spaces: visions of a good
   Anthropocene in southern Africa}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{The unique challenges posed by the Anthropocene require creative ways of
   engaging with the future and bringing about transformative change.
   Envisioning positive futures is a first step in creating a shared
   understanding and commitment that enables radical transformations toward
   sustainability in a world defined by complexity, diversity, and
   uncertainty. However, to create a transformative space in which truly
   unknowable futures can be explored, new experimental approaches are
   needed that go beyond merely extrapolating from the present into
   archetypal scenarios of the future. Here, we present a process of
   creative visioning where participatory methods and tools from the field
   of futures studies were combined in a novel way to create and facilitate
   a transformative space, with the aim of generating positive narrative
   visions for southern Africa. We convened a diverse group of participants
   in a workshop designed to develop radically different scenarios of good
   Anthropocenes, based on existing ``seeds{''} of the future in the
   present. These seeds are innovative initiatives, practices, and ideas
   that are present in the world today, but are not currently widespread or
   dominant. As a result of a carefully facilitated process that encouraged
   a multiplicity of perspectives, creative immersion, and grappling with
   deeply held assumptions, four radical visions for southern Africa were
   produced. Although these futures are highly innovative and exploratory,
   they still link back to current real-world initiatives and contexts. The
   key learning that arose from this experience was the importance of the
   imagination for transformative thinking, the need to capitalize on
   diversity to push boundaries, and finally, the importance of creating a
   space that enables participants to engage with emotions, beliefs, and
   complexity. This method of engagement with the future has the potential
   to create transformative spaces that inspire and empower people to act
   toward positive Anthropocene visions despite the complexity of the
   sustainability challenge.}},

Title = {{Robustness of adult female survival maintains a high-density sika deer
   (Cervus nippon) population following the initial irruption}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{143-154}},
Abstract = {{Context. Irruption of large herbivore populations is characterised by
   three distinct phases: (1) an exponential increase in population to a
   peak abundance; (2) a population crash; and (3) a second increase to
   another population peak, typically lower than the first peak of
   abundance. However, there has been little study of age-and sex-specific
   factors that affect the post-initial irruption interactions with food
   sources.
   Aims. We aimed to investigate annual survival rates of sika deer (Cervus
   nippon Temminck, 1838) in the sequent irruption of a population on
   Nakanoshima Island, Lake Toya, Japan, with a chronically high density
   during the period 2002-12.
   Methods. Survival monitoring data were obtained for 219 individuals (93
   males and 126 females) using radio-collars. Annual survival was
   quantified, and related factors, i.e. deer abundance and winter
   severity, were determined by model selection using Akaike information
   criterion values.
   Key Results. The results showed that annual survival rates across sexes
   and age classes (fawn, yearling, prime-aged, old) decreased with
   increasing population density, snow depth and winter precipitation.
   Winter severity had a greater effect on adult survival than density
   regulation. Nevertheless, female adult survival was maintained at a high
   level, with a mean of 0.84 (95\% CI: 0.80-0.88).
   Key conclusions. Robust survival rates for adult females might
   contribute to the maintenance of a high-density sika deer population in
   the post-initial irruption.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how historic habitat changes have impacted species and

   imagery analysis to assess how changes in land use/land cover have
   influenced the distribution of eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus
   catenatus), a federally threatened species, and its habitat in
   northeastern Ohio over the past similar to 75 years. We also examined
   land use/land cover changes throughout southern Michigan for a broader
   perspective on the influence of historical processes on contemporary
   habitat. There was a pronounced shift in northeastern Ohio land cover
   from 1938 to 2011 with forest cover becoming the predominant land cover
   type as agricultural fields were abandoned and succession occurred. Most
   known eastern massasauga locations in the area were at some point used
   for agriculture and higher habitat suitability values were associated
   with agricultural fields that were eventually abandoned. We observed
   more stable habitat conditions across southern Michigan populations
   indicating agricultural abandonment was not as necessary for habitat
   creation in this part of their range. We present a new approach for
   linking historical landscapes to present day habitat suitability models;
   permitting inferences on how prior land use/land cover states have
   influenced the current distribution of species and their habitats. We
   demonstrate how agricultural abandonment was an important source of
   early successional habitat for a species that requires an open canopy, a

Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{57-65}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Models of dispersal for response to global climate change can refer to
   theory on traveling waves developed for invasions. The relevance of this
   theory may depend on its density- versus habitat dependence, but it has
   not considered environmental gradients nor related feedbacks. An agent
   based simulation model (ABM) for a plant species or vegetation type is
   developed here, focusing on properties of traveling waves. The ABM
   simulated no-tailed, thin-tailed, and fat-tailed dispersal kernels
   (random uniform, Gaussian, and Cauchy kernels, respectively).
   Probabilities were based on either population density or habitat, and
   for the latter as homogeneous or on a gradient, and if a gradient
   positive feedback from populations to the habitat was added to represent
   process at ecotones such as a positive feedback switch or the stress
   gradient hypothesis (SGH) feedback. The uniform and Gaussian kernels
   produced traveling waves with constant speed, but the fat-tailed Cauchy
   kernel produced traveling waves that accelerated and also flattened as
   the low-probability. portion of wave accelerated fastest. On a gradient,
   when populations approached the limit of habitability the waves
   steepened and stopped traveling. The effect of SGH feedback on traveling
   wave slopes depends on the dispersal kernel. With strong facilitation on
   the gradient, greater variety of spatial patterns were able to develop
   among the replicate simulations of the fat-tailed kernel when it
   flattened to a greater spatial extent of low probability presence. In
   addition to the heterogeneity of the habitat and its modification by
   facilitation, the details of dispersal can also affect the feedback
   between spatial pattern and the establishment process that will affect
   the rate of advance of a species or an ecotone into new territory. (C)

Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{E248-E258}},

Abstract = {{Plant species exert a dominant control over the nitrogen (N) cycle of
   natural and managed grasslands. Although in intensively managed systems
   that receive large external N inputs the emission of the potent
   greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is a crucial component of this cycle,
   a mechanistic relationship between plant species and N2O emissions has
   not yet been established. Here we use a plant functional trait approach
   to study the relation between plant species strategies and N2O emissions
   from soils. Compared to species with conservative strategies, species
   with acquisitive strategies have higher N uptake when there is ample N
   in the soil, but also trigger N mineralization when soil N is limiting.
   Therefore, we hypothesized that (1) compared to conservative species,
   species with acquisitive traits reduce N2O emissions after a high N
   addition; and (2) species with conservative traits have lower N2O
   emissions than acquisitive plants if there is no high N addition. This
   was tested in a greenhouse experiment using monocultures of six grass
   species with differing above-and below-ground traits, growing across a
   gradient of soil N availability. We found that acquisitive species
   reduced N2O emissions at all levels of N availability, produced higher
   biomass and showed larger N uptake. As such, acquisitive species had
   87\% lower N2O emissions per unit of N uptake than conservative species
   (p<.05). Structural equation modelling revealed that specific leaf area
   and root length density were key traits regulating the effects of plants
   on N2O emission and biomass productivity. These results provide the
   first framework to understand the mechanisms through which plants
   modulate N2O emissions, pointing the way to develop productive
   grasslands that contribute optimally to climate change mitigation.}},

Abstract = {{We have little empirical evidence of how large-scale overlaps between
   large numbers of marine species may have altered in response to human
   impacts. Here, we synthesized all available distribution data (>1
   million records) since 1992 for 61 species of the East Australian marine
   ecosystem, a global hot spot of ocean warming and continuing fisheries
   exploitation. Using a novel approach, we constructed networks of the
   annual changes in geographical overlaps between species. Using indices
   of changes in species overlap, we quantified changes in the ecosystem
   stability, species robustness, species sensitivity and structural
   keystone species. We then compared the species overlap indices with
   environmental and fisheries data to identify potential factors leading
   to the changes in distributional overlaps between species. We found that
   the structure of the ecosystem has changed with a decrease in
   asymmetrical geographical overlaps between species. This suggests that
   the ecosystem has become less stable and potentially more susceptible to
   environmental perturbations. Most species have shown a decrease in
   overlaps with other species. The greatest decrease in species overlap
   robustness and sensitivity to the loss of other species has occurred in
   the pelagic community. Some demersal species have become more robust and
   less sensitive. Pelagic structural keystone species, predominately the
   tunas and billfish, have been replaced by demersal fish species. The
   changes in species overlap were strongly correlated with regional
   oceanographic changes, in particular increasing ocean warming and the
   southward transport of warmer and saltier water with the East Australian
   Current, but less correlated with fisheries catch. Our study illustrates
   how large-scale multispecies distribution changes can help identify
   structural changes in marine ecosystems associated with climate change.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{11-26}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Understanding, predicting, and managing the spatiotemporal complexity of
   stream thermal regimes requires monitoring strategies designed
   specifically to make inference about spatiotemporal variability on the
   whole stream network. Moreover, monitoring can be tailored to capture
   particular facets of this complex thermal landscape that may be
   important indicators for species and life stages of management concern.
   We applied spatial stream network models (SSNMs) to an empirical dataset
   of water temperature from the Snoqualmie River watershed, WA, and use
   results to provide guidance with respect to necessary sample size,
   location of new sites, and selection of a modeling approach. As
   expected, increasing the number of monitoring stations improved both
   predictive precision and the ability to estimate covariates of stream
   temperature; however, even relatively small numbers of monitoring
   stations, n = 20, did an adequate job when well-distributed and when
   used to build models with only a few covariates. In general, winter data
   were easier to model and, across seasons, mean temperatures were easier
   to model than summer maximums, winter minimums, or variance. Adding new
   sites was advantageous but we did not observe major differences in model
   performance for particular new site locations. Adding sites from parts
   of the river network with thermal regimes which differed from the rest
   of the network, and which were therefore highly influential, improved
   nearby predictions but reduced model-estimated precision of predictions
   in the rest of the network. Lastly, using models which accounted for the
   network based spatial correlation between observations made it much more
   likely that estimated prediction confidence intervals covered the true
   parameter; the exact form of the spatial correlation made little
   difference. By incorporating spatial structure between observations,
   SSNMs are particularly valuable for accurate estimation of prediction
   uncertainty at unmeasured locations. Based on our results, we make the
   following suggestions for designing water temperature monitoring arrays:
   (1) make use of pilot data when possible; (2) maintain a distribution of
   monitors across the stream network (i.e., over space and across the full
   range of covariates); (3) maintain multiple spatial clusters for more
   accurately estimating correlation of nearby sites; (4) if sites are to
   be added, prioritize capturing a range of covariates over adding new
   tributaries; (5) maintain a sensor array in winter; and (6) expect
   reduced accuracy and precision when predicting metrics other than means.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a transferable method to identify indicator species and

   novel, rigorous external evaluations of the spatial and temporal

   central Great Basin (Lander, Nye, and Eureka Counties, Nevada) and
   western Great Basin (Mono County, California and Mineral, Douglas, and
   Lyon Counties, Nevada), United States. We used Bayesian model selection
   to identify sets of five species that best explained observed variation
   in species richness of the same or the other taxonomic group in either
   subregion. We then built random forest models that included only the
   five identified indicator species and externally tested these models
   with new data from the other subregion (central or western Great Basin)
   or a later time in the same subregion. We compared the predictive
   accuracy of indicator species only models to that of models based on
   environmental variables or on both indicator species and environmental
   variables. In external evaluations, models based on same-taxon indicator
   species predicted 34-52\% of the variation in species richness of birds
   and 40-70\% of the variation in species richness of butterflies.
   Comparable models based on environmental variables predicted 11-46\% of
   the variation in species richness of birds and 12-67\% of the variation
   in species richness of butterflies. Models based on same-taxon indicator
   species predicted more variation in species richness than those based on
   environmental variables in seven of eight cases. Our results suggested
   that the predictive accuracy and spatial and temporal transferability of
   models based on indicator species can exceed that of models based on
   environmental variables. If mechanistic responses to environmental

   The DMUs are Germany's kreisfreie Stddte, which are towns and cities
   with special status as independent administrations. The primary interest
   was to investigate efficiency in land use. In this previous study an
   economic and an ecological model were used to apply the DEA to cities.
   The efficiency values of both models are presented in a nine-field
   matrix.
   The current study goes beyond these principal findings by introducing
   two further interpretative approaches. First: In addition to the input
   and output indicators of the DEA, other illustrative indicators are
   adopted as a second stage of investigation in order to understand which
   specific structural, economic, ecological and social feature values can
   be attributed to highly efficient cities as opposed to less efficient
   cities. Under this interpretative approach, DEA helps shed light on the
   concept of efficiency. Findings show that medium-sized cities make the
   most efficient use of land (developed as settlement and traffic area),
   that settlement area is not the only factor determining high efficiency,
   that high density alone is no guarantee of efficiency, that some large
   cities show high land productivity yet low economic efficiency (in
   Germany there is a clear division between old industrialised cities and
   cities benefitting from the new economy). Second: By combining variable
   and constant returns to scale, it is possible to calculate scale
   efficiency scores for cities. Under this second interpretative approach,
   development pathways can be discerned for cities to increase efficiency.
   Some cities seem to have the potential to improve their economic and
   ecological efficiency without changing the amount of land developed for
   settlements and traffic (e.g. by unsealing and restoring brownflelds).
   Furthermore, cities operating in the range of increasing returns of
   scale should be able to increase their settlement area without
   jeopardizing efficiency.
   Although the focus of the presented model is on urban quality connected
   to the efficient usage of settlement and traffic area, it may also be
   applied to the investigation of other relations depending on the
   respective research interest. Such observations can support urban
   developers in estimating the effects of land-use change, brownfields
   restoration and redevelopment, as well as pinpointing factors to improve
   economic and ecological performance.}},

Abstract = {{Simple screening approaches for the neurotoxicant methylmercury (MeHg)
   in aquatic ecosystems may be helpful in risk assessments of natural
   resources. We explored the development of such an approach in the
   Adirondack Mountains of New York, USA, a region with high levels of MeHg
   bioaccumulation. Thirty-six perennial streams broadly representative of
   1st and 2nd order streams in the region were sampled during summer low
   flow and analyzed for several solutes and for Hg concentrations in fish.
   Several landscape and chemical metrics that are typically strongly
   related to MeHg concentrations in aquatic biota were explored for
   strength of association with fish Hg concentrations. Data analyses were
   based on site mean length-normalized and standardized Hg concentrations
   (assumed to be dominantly MeHg) in whole juvenile and adult Brook Trout
   Salvelinus fontinalis, Creek Chub Semotilus atromaculatus, Blacknose
   Dace Rhinichthys atratulus, and Central Mudminnow Umbra limi, as well as
   on multi-species z-scores. Surprisingly, none of the landscape metrics
   was related significantly to regional variation in fish Hg
   concentrations or to z-scores across the study streams. In contrast,
   several chemical metrics including dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   concentrations, sulfate concentrations (SO42-), pH, ultraviolet
   absorbance (UV254), and specific ultra-violet absorbance were
   significantly related to regional variation in fish Hg concentrations. A
   cluster analysis based on DOC, SO42-, and pH identified three distinct
   groups of streams: (1) high DOC, acidic streams, (2) moderate DOC,
   slightly acidic streams, and (3) low DOC circumneutral streams with
   relatively high SO42-. Preliminary analysis indicated no significant
   difference in fish Hg z-scores between the moderate and high DOC groups,
   so these were combined for further analysis. The resulting two groups
   showed strong differences (p < 0.001) in DOC and SO42- concentrations as
   well as in pH and UV254 values. Median fish z-scores were significantly
   higher (p = 0.002) in the group of streams with higher DOC and UV254 and
   lower pH and SO42-. Screening values of DOC > 6.9 mg/L, SO42- < 2.8
   mg/L, pH < 6.6, and UV254 > 0.31 cm(-1) were tested as thresholds to
   identify Adirondack stream sites likely to have higher fish Hg
   concentrations. By applying a combined threshold of exceedance for
   either pH or UV254, sites with fish Hg concentrations that exceeded a
   wildlife guideline of 100 ng/g were correctly identified about 75\% of
   the time among the 36 study streams. An estimate of Hg risk applied to a
   data set of 391 streams based on DOC concentrations showed that about
   28\% were likely to pose high risk to wildlife; most of these streams
   were located in the western Adirondacks.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In mammals, lactation can be the most energetically expensive part of
   the reproductive cycle. Thus, when energy needs are compromised due to
   predation risk, environmental disturbance, or resource scarcity, future
   reproductive success can be impacted. In marine and terrestrial
   environments, foraging behavior is inextricably linked to predation
   risk. But quantification of foraging energetics for lactating animals
   under predation risk is less understood. In this study, we used a
   spatially explicit individual-based model to study how changes in
   physiology (lactating or not) and the environment (predation risk)
   affect optimal behavior in dolphins. Specifically, we predicted that an
   adult dolphin without calf would incur lower relative energetic costs
   compared to a lactating dolphin with calf regardless of predation risk
   severity, antipredator behavior, or prey quality consumed. Under this
   state-dependent analysis of risk approach, we found predation risk to be
   a stronger driver in affecting total energetic costs (foraging plus
   locomotor costs) than food quality for both dolphin types. Further,
   contrary to our hypothesis, after accounting for raised energy demands,
   a lactating dolphin with calf does not necessarily have higher
   relative-to-baseline costs than a dolphin without calf. Our results
   indicate that both a lactating (with calf) and non-lactating dolphin
   incur lowered energetic costs under a risk-averse behavioral scheme, but
   consequently suffer from lost foraging calories. A lactating dolphin
   with calf could be particularly worse off in lost foraging calories
   under elevated predation risk, heightened vigilance, and increased
   hiding time relative to an adult dolphin without calf. Further, hiding
   time in refuge could be more consequential than detection distance for
   both dolphin types in estimated costs and losses incurred. In
   conclusion, our study found that reproductive status is an important
   consideration in analyzing risk effects in mammals, especially in
   animals with lengthy lactation periods and those exposed to both
   biological and nonbiological stressors.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the main areas of carbon cycle and climate change studies,
   water and CO2 relations are of great significance for estimation of
   gross primary production (GPP). Various biogeochemical process-based
   models have been set up to estimate the GPP based on mathematical
   representation of biological, physiological and ecological processes.
   However, they ended up increasing the complexity and computational
   processing power due to the large number of physical equations that need
   to be solved. Computational time becomes an important matter in the
   simulation of multiple scenarios using models for long periods of time
   (e.g. climate projections). Data driven surrogate models have proven to
   be a useful tool for environmental modelling especially when ecological
   and climatic co-variates are large. The advantages of Data Driven Models
   (DDM) are: the possibility of adding new independent variables even if
   their understanding is weak, and short computational time to run. The
   aim is to explore the ability of DDMs to replicate a biochemical model
   calculating GPP. This study evaluates the performance of four surrogate
   DDMs, namely linear regression method (LRM), model tree (MT),
   instance-based learning (IBL) and artificial neural network (ANN). A
   simple empirical and semi-empirical relationship between GPP and
   climatic variables are studied. Input variable selection (IVS) methods
   were used to decide on the most relevant and potential environmental
   model inputs and then followed by a two-step approach which included a
   model-free and a model-based technique. Data from the highlands (paramo
   ecosystem) in the Ecuadorian Andean Region from 12-year time-series
   (2000-2011) were used to evaluate the models at various time frames and
   at different altitudes. The GPP time series data for the same period
   were derived from an earlier study using the biomodel BIOME-BGC
   (BioGeochemical Cycles), which is a comprehensive physical based model
   used in different analysis of carbon fluxes around the world. So-called
   IBL (nearest neighbour method) showed a great capability to reproduce
   the GPP when data was aggregated to monthly time frame. The
   computational time used to evaluate the time series with IBL as the
   selected DDM is shorter with enough accuracy for using it in multi-model
   runs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   their targets to develop an index with concrete targets, through the use
   of pertinent sustainability indicators, that SIDS should aim to achieve
   a sustainable society. In addition to the three categorical pillars of
   SD (social, economic and environmental), we included the category
   Climate Change and Disaster Management (incorporating Disaster Risk
   Reduction). The basis of our decision is that the UN and the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have both recognized the
   vulnerability of SIDS to both environmental hazards. Our index scores a
   total 70 individual indicators for the four categories to track the
   progress of a SIDS towards a sustainable society. Using the Caribbean
   nation, Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, as our SIDS case study, we
   report the average of the scores for each category to illustrate its
   progress towards sustainability. Overall Trinidad and Tobago is slowly
   progressing towards a more sustainably developed society. Our results
   show that the nation is only moderately successful regarding progress in
   three traditional pillars of SD, social, economic and environmental.
   However, Trinidad and Tobago scores poorly in the Climate Change and

Abstract = {{Potato is a staple food crop and a most important agricultural commodity

   energy use, biodiversity, golden potato cyst nematode, and land use. The
   4 systems included traditional potato system, quasi-industrial potato

Abstract = {{Conservation decisions often involve allocation of scarce resources

   of Molecular Ecology Resources, Razgour et al. (2017) present a new
   prioritization framework that coherently integrates three dimensions of

   range shift potential. They measure these dimensions for 10 populations
   of a European bat using a suite of advanced analysis methods that
   leverage genomic, environmental and occurrence data. Explicitly
   recognizing and quantifying the multidimensional nature of conservation
   priorities is a key advance because it enables a nuanced assessment of
   each population and identification of populations of high concern along

Abstract = {{Assessing the impacts of ongoing climate and anthropogenic-induced
   change on wildlife populations requires understanding species
   distributions and abundances across large spatial and temporal scales.
   For threatened or declining populations, collecting sufficient
   broad-scale data is challenging as sample sizes tend to be low because
   many such species are rare and/or elusive. As a result, demographic data
   are often piecemeal, leading to difficulties in determining causes of
   population changes and developing strategies to mitigate the effects of
   environmental stressors. Thus, the population dynamics of threatened
   species across spatio-temporal extents is typically inferred through
   incomplete, independent, local-scale studies. Emerging integrative
   modeling approaches, such as integrated population models (IPMs),
   combine multiple data types into a single analysis and provide a
   foundation for overcoming problems of sparse or fragmentary data. In
   this paper, we demonstrate how IPMs can be successfully implemented by
   synthesizing the elements, advantages, and novel insights of this
   modeling approach. We highlight the latest developments in IPMs that are
   explicitly relevant to the ecology and conservation of threatened
   species, including capabilities to quantify the spatial scale of
   management, source sink dynamics, synchrony within metapopulations, and
   population density effects on demographic rates. Adoption of IPMs has
   led to improved detection of population declines, adaptation of targeted
   monitoring schemes, and refined management strategies. Continued
   methodological advancements of IPMs, such as incorporation of a wider
   set of data types (e.g., citizen science data) and coupled
   population-environment models, will allow for broader applicability

Abstract = {{Biologging technologies are changing the way in which the marine
   environment is observed and monitored. However, because device retrieval
   is typically required to access the high-resolution data they collect,
   their use is generally restricted to those animals that predictably
   return to land. Data abstraction and transmission techniques aim to
   address this, although currently these are limited in scope and do not
   incorporate, for example, acceleration measurements which can quantify
   animal behaviours and movement patterns over fine-scales. In this study,
   we present a new method for the collection, abstraction and transmission
   of accelerometer data from free-ranging marine predators via the Argos
   satellite system. We test run the technique on 20 juvenile southern
   elephant seals Mirounga leonina from the Kerguelen Islands during their
   first months at sea following weaning. Using retrieved archival data
   from nine individuals that returned to the colony, we compare and
   validate abstracted transmissions against outputs from established
   accelerometer processing procedures. Abstracted transmissions included
   estimates, across five segments of a dive profile, of time spent in prey
   catch attempt (PrCA) behaviours, swimming effort and pitch. These were
   then summarised and compared to archival outputs across three dive
   phases: descent, bottom and ascent. Correlations between the two
   datasets were variable but generally good (dependent on dive phase,
   marginal R-2 values of between .45 and .6 to>.9) and consistent between
   individuals. Transmitted estimates of PrCA behaviours and swimming
   effort were positively biased to those from archival processing. Data
   from this study represent some of the first remotely transmitted
   quantifications from accelerometers. The methods presented and analysed
   can be used to provide novel insight towards the behaviours and
   movements of free-ranging marine predators, such as juvenile southern
   elephant seals, from whom logger retrieval is challenging. Future
   applications could however benefit from some adaption, particularly to
   reduce positive bias in transmitted PrCA behaviours and swimming effort,
   for which this study provides useful insight.}},

Abstract = {{Hypoxic or oxygen-free zones are linked to large-scale mortalities of

   understand the implications of long-term exposure on fish and their
   ability to acclimate. To test the effects of long-term exposure (months)
   of fish to hypoxia we devised a novel method to control the level of
   available oxygen. Juvenile golden perch (Macquaria ambigua ambigua), and
   silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus), two key native species found within
   the Murray Darling Basin, Australia, were exposed to different
   temperatures (20, 24 and 28 degrees C) combined with normoxic (6-8
   mgO(2) L-1 or 12-14 kPa) and hypoxic (3-4 mgO(2) L-1 or 7-9 kPa)
   conditions. After 10 months, fish were placed in individual respirometry
   chambers to measure standard and maximum metabolic rate (SMR and MMR),
   absolute aerobic scope (AAS) and hypoxia tolerance. Golden perch had a
   much higher tolerance to hypoxia exposure than silver perch, as most
   silver perch died after only 1 month exposure. Golden perch acclimated
   to hypoxia had reduced MMR at 20 and 28 degrees C, but there was no
   change to SMR. Long-term exposure to hypoxia improved the tolerance of
   golden perch to hypoxia, compared to individuals held under normoxic
   conditions suggesting that golden perch can acclimate to levels around 3
   mgO(2) L-1 (kPa similar to 7) and lower. The contrasting tolerance of

Abstract = {{Invasive annual weeds negatively impact ecosystem services and pose a

   interannual climate and subseasonal weather variability that impacts
   seed germination, seedling survival and establishment, annual weed
   dynamics, wildfire frequency, and soil stability. Rehabilitation and
   restoration outcomes could be improved by adopting a weather-centric
   approach that uses the full spectrum of available site-specific weather
   information from historical observations, seasonal climate forecasts,
   and climate-change projections. Climate data can be used retrospectively
   to interpret success or failure of past seedings by describing seasonal
   and longer-term patterns of environmental variability subsequent to
   planting. A more detailed evaluation of weather impacts on site
   conditions may yield more flexible adaptive-management strategies for
   range-land restoration and rehabilitation, as well as provide estimates
   of transition probabilities between desirable and undesirable vegetation
   states. Skillful seasonal climate forecasts could greatly improve the
   cost efficiency of management treatments by limiting revegetation
   activities to time periods where forecasts suggest higher probabilities
   of successful seedling establishment. Climate-change projections are key
   to the application of current environmental models for development of

Abstract = {{Aim: Species distribution models are important tools used to study the
   distribution and abundance of organisms relative to abiotic variables.
   Dynamic local interactions among species in a community can affect
   abundance. The abundance of a single species may not be at equilibrium
   with the environment for spreading invasive species and species that are
   range shifting because of climate change.
   Innovation: We develop methods for incorporating temporal processes into
   a spatial joint species distribution model for presence/absence and
   ordinal abundance data. We model non-equilibrium conditions via a
   temporal random effect and temporal dynamics with a vectorautoregressive
   process allowing for intra-and interspecific dependence between
   co-occurring species. The autoregressive term captures how the abundance
   of each species can enhance or inhibit its own subsequent abundance or
   the subsequent abundance of other species in the community and is well
   suited for a `community modules' approach of strongly interacting
   species within a food web. R code is provided for fitting multispecies
   models within a Bayesian framework for ordinal data with any number of
   locations, time points, covariates and ordinal categories.
   Main conclusions: We model ordinal abundance data of two invasive
   insects (hemlock woolly adelgid and elongate hemlock scale) that share a
   host tree and were undergoing northwards range expansion in the eastern
   U.S.A. during the period 1997-2011. Accounting for range expansion and
   high inter-annual variability in abundance led to improved estimation of
   the species-environment relationships. We would have erroneously
   concluded that winter temperatures did not affect scale abundance had we
   not accounted for the range expansion of scale. The autoregressive
   component revealed weak evidence for commensalism, in which adelgid may
   have predisposed hemlock stands for subsequent infestation by scale.
   Residual spatial dependence indicated that an unmeasured variable
   additionally affected scale abundance. Our robust modelling approach
   could provide similar insights for other community modules of
   co-occurring species.}},

Title = {{Detecting outliers in species distribution data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Species distribution data play a pivotal role in the study of
   ecology, evolution, biogeography and biodiversity conservation. Although
   large amounts of location data are available and accessible from public
   databases, data quality remains problematic. Of the potential sources of
   error, positional errors are critical for spatial applications,
   particularly where these errors place observations beyond the
   environmental or geographical range of species. These outliers need to
   be identified, checked and removed to improve data quality and minimize
   the impact on subsequent analyses. Manually checking all species records
   within large multispecies datasets is prohibitively costly. This work
   investigates algorithms that may assist in the efficient vetting of
   outliers in such large datasets.
   Location: We used real, spatially explicit environmental data derived
   from the western part of Victoria, Australia, and simulated species
   distributions within this same region.
   Methods: By adapting species distribution modelling (SDM), we developed
   a pseudo-SDM approach for detecting outliers in species distribution
   data, which was implemented with random forest (RF) and support vector
   machine (SVM) resulting in two new methods: RF\_pdSDM and SVM\_pdSDM.
   Using virtual species, we compared eight existing multivariate outlier
   detection methods with these two new methods under various conditions.
   Results: The two new methods based on the pseudo-SDM approach had higher
   true skill statistic (TSS) values than other approaches, with TSS values
   always exceeding 0. More than 70\% of the true outliers in datasets for
   species with a low and intermediate prevalence can be identified by
   checking 10\% of the data points with the highest outlier scores.
   Main conclusions: Pseudo-SDM-based methods were more effective than
   other outlier detection methods. However, this outlier detection
   procedure can only be considered as a screening tool, and putative
   outliers must be examined by experts to determine whether they are
   actual errors or important records within an inherently biased set of
   data.}},

   communities revealed by comparative phylogenomics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{177-189}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aim: The alpine region of mainland Australia is one of the world's 187
   biodiversity hotspots. Genetic analyses of Australian alpine fauna
   indicate high levels of endemism on fine spatial scales, unlike Northern
   Hemisphere alpine systems where shallow genetic differentiation is
   typically observed among populations. These discrepancies have been
   attributed to differences in elevation and influence from glacial
   activity, and point to a unique phylogeographic history affecting
   Australian alpine biodiversity. To test generality of these findings
   across Australian alpine biota, we assessed patterns of genetic
   structure across plant species.
   Location: The Australian Alps, Victoria, eastern Australia.
   Methods: We used an economical pooled genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)
   approach to examine patterns of genetic diversity among seven widespread
   species including shrubs and forbs from 16 mountain summits in the
   Australian Alpine National Park. Patterns of genetic structure among
   summit populations for each species were inferred from an average of
   2,778 independent SNP loci using Bayesian phylogenomic inference and
   clustering approaches.
   Results: SNP results were consistent across species in identifying deep
   evolutionary splits among summit communities from the Northern and
   Central Victorian Alpine regions. These patterns of genetic structure
   are also consistent with those previously reported for invertebrate and
   mammal taxa. However, local genetic structure was less pronounced in the
   plants, supporting the notion that population connectivity tends to be
   higher in plant species.
   Main conclusion: There is deep lineage diversification between the North
   and Central Victorian Alpine regions, reflecting a high level of
   endemism. These findings differ from those reported for alpine
   biodiversity from New South Wales and much of the Northern Hemisphere,
   and support the notion that genetic diversity is typically greatest in
   areas least affected by historical ice sheet formation. We discuss the
   implications of our findings in the context of conservation planning,
   and highlight the benefits of this rapid and cost-effective genome scan
   approach for characterizing evolutionary processes at multispecies and
   landscape scales.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-72}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. The management of insect pests has long been dominated by the use of
   chemical insecticides, with the aim of instantaneously killing enough
   individuals to limit their damage. To minimize unwanted consequences,
   environmentally friendly approaches have been proposed that utilize
   biological control and take advantage of intrinsic demographic processes
   to reduce pest populations.
   2. We address the feasibility of a novel pest management strategy based
   on the release of insects infected with Wolbachia, which causes
   cytoplasmic incompatibilities in its host population, into a population
   with a pre-existing Allee effect. We hypothesize that the transient
   decline in population size caused by a successful invasion of Wolbachia
   can bring the population below its Allee threshold and, consequently,
   trigger extinction.
   3. We develop a stochastic population model that accounts for
   Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibilities in addition to an Allee
   effect arising from mating failures at low population densities. Using
   our model, we identify conditions under which cytoplasmic
   incompatibilities and Allee effects successfully interact to drive
   insect pest populations towards extinction. Based on our results, we
   delineate control strategies based on introductions of
   Wolbachia-infected insects.
   4. We extend this analysis to evaluate control strategies that implement
   successive introductions of two incompatible Wolbachia strains.
   Additionally, we consider methods that combine Wolbachia invasion with
   mating disruption tactics to enhance the pre-existing Allee effect.
   5. We demonstrate that Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility and
   the Allee effect act independently from one another: the Allee effect
   does not modify the Wolbachia invasion threshold, and cytoplasmic
   incompatibilities only have a marginal effect on the Allee threshold.
   However, the interaction of these two processes can drive even large
   populations to extinction. The success of this method can be amplified
   by the introduction of multiple Wolbachia cytotypes as well as the
   addition of mating disruption.
   6. Our study extends the existing literature by proposing the use of
   Wolbachia introductions to capitalize on pre-existing Allee effects and
   consequently eradicate insect pests. More generally, it highlights the
   importance of transient dynamics, and the relevance of manipulating a
   cascade of destabilizatons for pest management.}},

Title = {{Accounting for environmental uncertainty in the management of dredging
   impacts using probabilistic dose-response relationships and thresholds}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{415-425}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Dredging and related activities are common across nearshore marine
   environments, potentially threatening nearby ecosystems. Regulatory
   frameworks are essential for minimizing environmental impacts, yet rely
   heavily on a sound understanding of how ecosystems will respond to
   environmental stressors, and the thresholds that delineate benign and
   harmful conditions.
   2. Here, we use novel statistical approaches and mathematical tools to
   account for uncertainty in deriving in situ dose-response relationships
   and thresholds for the environmental management of dredging, based on
   estimates of the probability of non-zero mortality of corals during a
   dredging campaign at Barrow Island, Western Australia. Using modified
   receiver operating characteristic curves, we derive thresholds with
   explicit Type I and Type II errors rates, across the full range of
   primary stress pathways and exposure dimensions (intensity, frequency
   and duration).
   3. Monitoring coral health and mortality can be expensive and water
   quality indicators are often used to supplement direct receptor
   monitoring during dredging management. We found strong relationships
   between coral mortality and a range of water quality exposure metrics,
   lending support to the use of water quality metrics as management tools
   for protecting corals during dredging. Metrics based on sediment
   deposition were more statistically powerful than those based on either
   light or turbidity, but may be more difficult to implement in practice.
   Thresholds reflecting aversion to a false sense of security in
   environmental protection or aversion to the costs of false alarms varied
   substantially for all exposure metrics examined.
   4. Strategies for managing environmental harm under uncertainty are
   critical to achieving an informed risk-weighted balance between
   environmental protection outcomes and development costs. Our study
   demonstrates the complexities of how communities respond to variable
   environmental exposure across a range of pressures in time and space,
   and the value of integrating probabilistic approaches in environmental
   management to account for that complexity and its associated
   uncertainty. Coral mortality was strongly related to a range of water
   quality exposure metrics associated with dredging activities, and
   regulatory thresholds based on water quality can provide a solid and
   cost-effective foundation for protecting corals during dredging. The
   probabilistic dose-response relationships and thresholds presented here
   are the first to be derived from in situ data using dredging related
   coral mortality and represent a step forward in integrating formal
   decision science approaches into environmental management.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Foraging is an essential process for mobile animals, and its
   optimization serves as a foundational theory in ecology and evolution;
   however, drivers of foraging are rarely investigated across landscapes
   and seasons. Using a common bumblebee species from the western United
   States (Bombus vosnesenskii), we ask whether seasonal decreases in food
   resources prompt changes in foraging behavior and space use. We employ a
   unique integration of population genetic tools and spatially explicit
   foraging models to estimate foraging distances and rates of patch
   visitation for wild bumblebee colonies across three study regions and
   two seasons. By mapping the locations of 669 wild-caught individual
   foragers, we find substantial variation in colony-level foraging
   distances, often exhibiting a 60-fold difference within a study region.
   Our analysis of visitation rates indicates that foragers display a
   preference for destination patches with high floral cover and forage
   significantly farther for these patches, but only in the summer, when
   landscape-level resources are low. Overall, these results indicate that
   an increasing proportion of long-distance foraging bouts take place in
   the summer. Because wild bees are pollinators, their foraging dynamics
   are of urgent concern, given the potential impacts of global change on
   their movement and services. The behavioral shift toward long-distance
   foraging with seasonal declines in food resources suggests a novel,
   phenologically directed approach to landscape-level pollinator
   conservation and greater consideration of late-season floral resources
   in pollinator habitat management.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Population size changes can lead to changes in local abundance
   and/or site occupancy, depending on the processes influencing site use
   by individuals. Here, we quantify such changes for wintering waterbirds
   and assess their implications for widely used conservation strategies in
   which sites that support in excess of a given proportion of a population
   are prioritized for protection.
   Location: Britain.
   Methods: We use long-term survey data to quantify changes in population
   size and distribution for 19 waterbird species across Britain.
   Results: Population changes in these species have varied greatly (from
   declines of similar to 25\% to increases of > 1,600\%) over 26 years,
   and we show that change in local abundance was the predominant
   consequence of these changes, while colonization of new sites mainly
   occurred in response to large population increases. For most species,
   changes in abundance and occupancy were spatially dependent over
   relatively short distances, consistent with (but not conclusive of)
   density-dependent spillover. Levels of occupancy among species were
   negatively associated with proportions of sites, and populations within
   sites, exceeding the 1\% of total population threshold for site
   protection. For species increasing in overall population size, the
   occurrence of small incipient populations at new sites resulted in
   declines in the number of sites supporting > 1\% of the total population
   and the proportion of the population supported by these sites.
   Main conclusions: Fluctuations in waterbird population size are more
   likely to result in changes in local abundance than distribution.
   Consequences of population change for site protection when abundance
   thresholds are used for site designation depend on shifts in the
   evenness of distribution of abundances across sites, and whether
   occupancy is increasing or decreasing. Range-expanding species have an
   increased likelihood of losing some sites, and populations within sites,
   exceeding the 1\% of total population threshold for site protection.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Land-use change typically goes hand in hand with the introduction
   of exotic-species, which mingle with indigenous species to form novel
   assemblages. Here, we compare the functional structure of indigenous and
   exotic elements of ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages across four
   land-uses of varying management intensity.
   Location: Terceira Island (Azores, North Atlantic).
   Methods: We used pitfall traps to sample arthropods in 36 sites across
   the four land-uses and collated traits related to dispersal ability,
   body size and resource use. For both indigenous and exotic species, we
   examined the impact of land-uses on trait diversity and tested for the
   existence of non-random assembly processes using null models. We
   analysed differences in trait composition among land-uses for both
   indigenous and exotic species with multivariate analyses. We used
   point-biserial correlations to identity traits significantly correlated
   with specific land-uses for each element.
   Results: We recorded 86 indigenous and 116 exotic arthropod species.
   Under high-intensity land-use, both indigenous and exotic elements
   showed significant trait clustering. Trait composition strongly shifted
   across land-uses, with indigenous and exotic species being functionally
   dissimilar in all land-uses. Large-bodied herbivores dominated exotic
   elements in low-intensity land-uses, while small-bodied spiders
   dominated exotic elements in high-intensity land-uses. In contrast, with
   increasing land-use intensity, indigenous species changed from
   functionally diverse to being dominated by piercing and cutting
   herbivores.
   Main conclusions: Our study revealed two main findings: first, in
   high-intensity - land-uses, trait clustering characterized both
   indigenous and exotic elements; second, exotic species differed in their
   functional profile from indigenous species in all land-use types.
   Overall, our results provide new insights into the functional role of

Abstract = {{Biogenic emission algorithms predict that oak forests account for
   similar to 70\% of the total European isoprene budget. Yet the isoprene
   emission potentials (IEPs) that underpin these model estimates are
   calculated from a very limited number of leaf-level observations and
   hence are highly uncertain. Increasingly, micrometeorological techniques
   such as eddy covariance are used to measure whole-canopy fluxes
   directly, from which isoprene emission potentials can be calculated.
   Here, we review five observational datasets of isoprene fluxes from a
   range of oak forests in the UK, Italy and France. We outline procedures
   to correct the measured net fluxes for losses from deposition and
   chemical flux divergence, which were found to be on the order of 5-8 and
   4-5 \%, respectively. The corrected observational data were used to
   derive isoprene emission potentials at each site in a two-step process.
   Firstly, six commonly used emission algorithms were inverted to back out
   time series of isoprene emission potential, and then an ``average{''}
   isoprene emission potential was calculated for each site with an
   associated uncertainty. We used these data to assess how the derived
   emission potentials change depending upon the specific emission
   algorithm used and, importantly, on the particular approach adopted to
   derive an average site-specific emission potential. Our results show
   that isoprene emission potentials can vary by up to a factor of 4
   depending on the specific algorithm used and whether or not it is used
   in a ``big-leaf{''} or ``canopy environment (CE) model{''} format. When
   using the same algorithm, the calculated average isoprene emission
   potential was found to vary by as much as 34\% depending on how the
   average was derived. Using a consistent approach with version 2.1 of the
   Model for Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN), we derive
   new ecosystem-scale isoprene emission potentials for the five
   measurement sites: Alice Holt, UK (10 500 +/- 2500 mu gm(-2)h(-1));
   Bosco Fontana, Italy (1610 +/- 420 mu gm(-2)h(-1)); Castel-porziano,
   Italy (121 +/- 15 mu gm(-2)h(-1)); Ispra, Italy (7590 +/- 1070 mu g
   g(-1) h(-1)); and the Observatoire de Haute Provence, France (7990 +/-
   1010 mu g g(-1) h(-1)). Ecosystemscale isoprene emission potentials were
   then extrapolated to the leaf-level and compared to previous leaf-level
   measurements for Quercus robur and Quercus pubescens, two species
   thought to account for 50\% of the total European isoprene budget. The
   literature values agreed closely with emission potentials calculated
   using the G93 algorithm, which were 85 +/- 75 and 78 +/- 25 mu g g(-1)
   h(-1) for Q. robur and Q. pubescens, respectively. By contrast, emission
   potentials calculated using the G06 algorithm, the same algorithm used
   in a previous study to derive the European budget, were significantly
   lower, which we attribute to the influence of past light and temperature
   conditions. Adopting these new G06 specific emission potentials for Q.
   robur (55 +/- 24 mu g g(-1) h(-1)) and Q. pubescens (47 +/- 16 mu g
   g(-1) h(-1)) reduced the projected European budget by similar to 17 \%.
   Our findings demonstrate that calculated isoprene emission potentials

Abstract = {{The Protostrongylidae is a diverse family of nematodes capable of
   causing significant respiratory and neuromuscular disease in their
   ungulate and lagomorph hosts. Establishing the species diversity and
   abundance of the protostrongylid fauna has been hindered because the
   first stage larvae, commonly referred as dorsal spined larvae (DSL),
   that are shed in the feces are morphologically very similar among
   several genera. We aimed to determine the protostrongylid diversity and
   distribution in caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus and R. t.
   pearyi) in the central and high Canadian Arctic. We first developed,
   tested and validated a morphological diagnostic guide for the DSL of two
   important protostrongylids, Parelaphostrongylus andersoni and
   Varestrongylus eleguneniensis, and then applied this guide to determine
   the prevalence and intensity of infection of these parasites in fecal
   samples from 242 caribou. We found that DSL of V. eleguneniensis and P.
   andersoni can be differentiated morphologically based on the structural
   differences at the caudal extremity. The presentation and morphology of
   the dorsal spine, and caudoventral bulging at the start of the tail
   extension were identified as the key identifying features. The two
   species were found in caribou on the arctic mainland and southern
   Victoria Island in single and co-infections, but the prevalence and
   intensity of infection was low. No protostrongylids were detected in
   caribou from the high arctic islands. Through this study, we provide a
   simple, efficient, and robust method to distinguish the DSL of the two
   protostrongylids, and present the current status of infection in
   different herds of caribou of the central Canadian Arctic. We report new
   geographic and host records for P. andersoni infection in Dolphin and
   Union caribou herd. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {{There is a growing need to easily describe and synthesize the dynamics

   sampling sites permits to produce an easy-to-read map that summarizes
   both the temporal dynamics of the community and the contribution of each
   species to these dynamics at each sampling site. A 24-yr-long time
   series of scientific surveys monitoring 77 fish and cephalopod species

Abstract = {{Climate change presents new challenges for selecting species for
   restoration. If migration fails to keep pace with climate change, as
   models predict, the most suitable sources for restoration may not occur
   locally at all. To address this issue, we propose a strategy of
   prestoration: utilizing species in restoration for which a site
   represents suitable habitat now and into the future. Using the Colorado
   Plateau, United States, as a case study, we assess the ability of grass
   species currently used regionally in restoration to persist into the
   future using projections of ecological niche models (or climate envelope
   models) across a suite of climate change scenarios. We then present a
   technique for identifying new species that best compensate for future
   losses of suitable habitat by current target species. We found that the
   current suite of species, selected by a group of experts, is predicted
   to perform reasonably well in the short term, but that losses of
   prestorable habitat by mid-century would approach 40\%. Using an
   algorithm to identify additional species, we found that fewer than 10
   species could compensate for nearly all of the losses incurred by the
   current target species. This case study highlights the utility of
   integrating ecological niche modeling and future climate forecasts to

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a practical water resources-related index
   methodology (Hydric Index for Location of Industrial Facilities HILIF)
   to provide preliminary guidance for location-based decision-making
   processes for new industrial sites, based on the likely effects on water
   resources in river watersheds, as applied to the conceptual phase of a
   project design. The framework of HILIF is established on the integration
   of three hydric factors: consumptive water availability, river carrying
   capacity, and flood vulnerability and effects of the drainage project.
   The proposed methodology for the application of HILIF is founded on
   Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) using fuzzy logic (fuzzy MADM) to
   combine seven indicators into nine possible recommendation levels.
   Additionally, in order to illustrate the HILIF methodological approach,
   a case study of a project design using a cyclical analysis based on a
   hypothetical scenario was developed. In this context, three alternative
   sites (AA, BB, and CC) were considered for a nitrogen fertilizer plant
   in the Contas River Basin in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The results
   demonstrate that the HILIF methodology can support the conceptual
   project design by identifying the most adequate site alternatives for an
   industrial location within an integrated hydric perspective. In
   addition, the possibility of implementing modifications during the
   initial conceptual project was observed through cyclical analysis using
   multiple rounds for the same locational alternatives. For the present
   case study, the locational alternative preferred by project designers
   (Alternative CC) shifted from a classification of Not Indicated (NI) in
   the first round of HILIF application to a Fairly-Good Recommendation in
   the second round after modifications in the initial conceptual project.
   Thus, Alternative CC became nearly as adequate as Alternative BB, which
   was the best alternative site in terms of water, classified as a Good
   Recommendation in the first HILIF round. On a complementary basis, the
   results generated by the application of HILIF can also be utilized to
   support further complex studies for licensing proposes within the
   context of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or Strategic
   Environmental Assessment (SEA).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{949-957}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   Recognizing ungulate browsing thresholds between viable and declining
   aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands are critical to ensuring
   long-term persistence of this biologically important plant community.
   Studies have shown declines in vigor and regeneration when as few as
   30\% of current annual twigs are browsed while other studies have shown
   higher limits. Although the effects of ungulate herbivory are of concern
   in aspen forests, few studies have assessed browsing effects following
   wildfire and few criteria exist for determining potential effects of
   ungulate browsing on aspen forests following wildfire. We evaluated the
   effects of ungulate abundance and foraging intensity on regenerating
   aspen 1 to 6 years post-fire and assessed the use of abundance and
   foraging intensity indicators in predicting impacts to regenerating
   aspen. Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelson) was the primary
   ungulate in the study area.
   Methods
   The study area was located within the 17 500 ha Cerro Grande Fire burn
   area in the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico, USA. We used percent aspen
   twigs browsed and pellet-group counts to evaluate relationships between
   these indicators and aspen patch structure (height, size). We collected
   data in randomly generated 3 x 33 m plots 5-6 years post-fire. We also
   established 4 fenced exclosures (25 x 55 m and 3.3 m in height) with
   paired unfenced plots 1-year post-fire to monitor aspen regeneration.
   Each spring, we recorded percent browsed twigs from the previous fall
   through the early spring period which coincided with the highest
   ungulate use period within the study area. We assessed associations
   between percent twigs browsed and pellet-group density and patch size
   and height of aspen using Spearman's correlation coefficients.
   Important Findings
   Mean percent twigs browsed and ungulate pellet-group density across the
   burn area was <= 31\% and 1 pellet-group 100 sq m(-1), respectively.
   Patch size and height decreased with increasing browsing and
   pellet-group density 5-6 years post-fire. However, mean aspen heights
   were approaching or exceeding a minimum browsing level of 2 m and,
   therefore, ungulate browsing did not appear sufficient to cause
   significant impacts to aspen across the burn area. We observed a
   positive correlation between pellet-group density and twig browsing
   suggesting that one or both measures could be used to assess potential
   effects of browsing on regenerating aspen following fire.}},

Abstract = {{What makes an alien plant species a successful invader remains a
   challenging question in invasion ecology. Although comparing functional
   traits of exotic species between their native and invasive ranges
   represents a sensible step when studying invaders, this approach is
   rarely applied and always disconnected from demographic attributes. In
   this study, we implemented a cross-continental comparison between native
   and invasive populations of sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), a tree
   native to central Europe and invasive in New Zealand. We analysed
   individual growth and population structure in addition to physiological,
   biochemical and metabolic leaf-traits of A. pseudoplatanus in both
   native (Northern France) and invaded (South Island of New Zealand)
   ranges under two light regimes (sun vs. shade). We found greater
   individual growth and shade tolerance in the invasive range. For a given
   sapling age, both basal stem diameter and height were more than twofold
   greater in New Zealand compared to France, irrespective of light
   conditions. At the leaf level, photosynthetic rates were higher along
   with higher leaf nitrogen content, leaf carbon content and leaf
   construction costs in New Zealand. However, French populations had
   significantly greater dark respiration and specific leaf area. Leaves of
   native trees contained more non-structural carbohydrates and chlorophyll
   but less soluble proteins than those of invasive trees. Our results
   indicate faster growth of A. pseudoplatanus in its invasive range
   compared to the native, which is at least partly due to greater
   shade-tolerance (i. e. more efficient photosynthesis at reduced costs
   under shade conditions) and plausibly to greater phenotypic plasticity
   to light. Functional shifts between the native and the invaded range
   allow the species to escape the growth-survival trade-off and exhibit
   greater growth in the invaded range. These shifts may be caused by
   differences in climatic conditions, biotic environment and/or in
   genotypes.}},

Abstract = {{We address the evolution of effective number of individuals under
   androdioecy and gynodioecy. We analyze dynamic models of autosomal
   modifiers of weak effect on sex expression. In our zygote control
   models, the sex expressed by a zygote depends on its own genotype, while
   in our maternal control models, it depends on the genotype of its
   maternal parent. Our analysis unifies full multi-dimensional local
   stability analysis with the Li-Price equation, which for all its
   heuristic appeal, describes evolutionary change over a single
   generation. We define a point in the neighborhood of a fixation state
   from which a single-generation step indicates the asymptotic behavior of
   the frequency of a modifier allele initiated at an arbitrary point near
   the fixation state. A concept of heritability appropriate for the
   evolutionary modification of sex emerges from the Li-Price framework. We
   incorporate our theoretical analysis into our previously-developed
   Bayesian inference framework to develop a new method for inferring the
   viability of gonochores (males or females) relative to hermaphrodites.
   Applying this approach to microsatellite data derived from natural
   populations of the gynodioecious plant Schiedea salicaria and the
   androdioecious killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus, we find that while
   female and hermaphrodite S. salicaria appear to have similar
   viabilities, male K. marmoratus appear to survive to reproductive age at
   less than half the rate of hermaphrodites. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We systematically reviewed the literature on the tragedy of the commons
   and common-property resources. We segregated studies by legal management
   regimes (de jure regimes) and management that develops in practice (de
   facto regimes) to understand how the structure of regime formation
   affects the outcome of community management on sustainability of
   resource use. De facto regimes, developed within the community, are more
   likely to have positive impacts on the resource. However, de facto
   regimes are fragile and not resilient in the face of increased
   population pressure and unregulated markets, and de facto management
   regimes are less successful where physical exclusion of external agents
   from resources is more difficult. Yet, formalization or imposition of de
   jure management regimes can have complicated impacts on sustainability.
   The imposition of de jure regimes usually has a negative outcome when
   existing de facto regimes operate at larger scales than the imposed de
   jure regime. In contrast, de jure regimes have largely positive impacts
   when the de facto regimes operate at scales smaller than the overlying
   de jure regimes. Formalization may also be counterproductive because of
   elite capture and the resulting de facto privatization (that allows
   elites to effectively exclude others) or de facto open access (where the
   disenfranchised may resort to theft and elites cannot effectively
   exclude them). This underscores that although the global movement to
   formalize community-management regimes may address some forms of
   inequity and may produce better outcomes, it does not ensure resource
   sustainability and may lead to greater marginalization of users.
   Comparison of governance systems that differentiate between initiatives
   that legitimize existing de facto regimes and systems that create new de
   facto regimes, investigations of new top-down de jure regimes, and
   studies that further examine different approaches to changing de jure
   regimes to de facto regimes are avenues for further inquiry.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing connectivity is an important strategy for facilitating

   We identified key areas likely to facilitate climate-induced species'

   sets and future climate projections, we mapped potential species'
   movement routes that link current climate conditions to analogous
   climate conditions in the future (i.e., future climate analogs) with a
   novel moving-window analysis based on electrical circuit theory. In
   addition to tracing shifting climates, the approach accounted for
   landscape permeability and empirically derived species' dispersal
   capabilities. We compared connectivity maps generated with our
   climate-change-informed approach with maps of connectivity based solely
   on the degree of human modification of the landscape. Including future
   climate projections in connectivity models substantially shifted and
   constrained priority areas for movement to a smaller proportion of the
   landscape than when climate projections were not considered. Potential
   movement, measured as current flow, decreased in all ecoregions when
   climate projections were included, particularly when dispersal was
   limited, which made climate analogs inaccessible. Many areas emerged as
   important for connectivity only when climate change was modeled in 2
   time steps rather than in a single time step. Our results illustrate
   that movement routes needed to track changing climatic conditions may
   differ from those that connect present-day landscapes. Incorporating
   future climate projections into connectivity modeling is an important

   ontario occurrences (n = 362) and used this along with climate and oak

   insect that sporadically makes ground-level visits, and that its assumed
   regional rarity is due to detection difficulties rather than demographic
   rarity. While the butterfly may be imperiled and worthy of legal
   protection in portions of its range, we question the validity of

   ground-level adult sightings, and recommend larval sampling using burlap

Abstract = {{1. Elemental analysis of biological calcified structures (e.g. fish
   otoliths, mollusc shelves, coral skeletons or fish and shark bones)
   provides invaluable information regarding ecological processes for many
   aquatic species. Despite this importance, the reduction of the raw data
   obtained through Laser-ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
   Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) (i.e. the conversion of the machine raw signal
   into elemental concentrations) remains a challenge as the tools
   developed so far for carrying out this task have important limitations
   for aquatic ecologists.
   2. Here, we introduce the elementr R-package which provides a handy,
   reliable and transparent way to reduce elemental data acquired from spot
   or transect LA-ICPMS analysis of biological calcified structures. This
   free and open-source software, implemented based on state-of-the-art
   literature, handles data from both standards and samples, allowing fast
   and simultaneous calculations of concentration for any chemical element,
   correction for potential machine drift, and realignment and averaging
   for sample replicates when needed.
   3. The major attributes of elementr are: (i) its user-friendly graphical
   interface which provides widgets to set all the reduction settings (i.e.
   no programming skills are required to run it), (ii) its reactivity
   whereby the software continuously observes any setting change made by
   the user, re-calculates and displays all updated results, allowing
   therefore users to visually check the validity of their settings and to
   tune them if needed and (iii) an object oriented underlying that
   facilitates subsequent handling of LA-ICPMS data in R.
   4. Despite the elementr design being most suited to the needs of aquatic
   ecologists, its use could be broadened to other research fields (i.e.
   geology, material engineering) due to its flexibility. Moreover, the
   open-source approach used for programming this software allows its
   expansion in order to refine calculation procedures or to add new
   functionalities.}},

Title = {{Distinguishing distribution dynamics from temporary emigration using
   dynamic occupancy models}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{1. Dynamic occupancy models are popular for estimating dynamic
   distribution rates (colonization and extinction) from repeated
   presence/absence surveys of unmarked animals. This approach assumes
   closure among repeated samples within primary periods, allowing
   estimation of dynamic rates between these periods. However, the impact
   of temporary emigration (TE; reversible changes in sampling
   availability) on dynamic rate estimates has not been tested.
   2. Using simulated data, we investigated the degree to which TE could
   mislead researchers interested in quantifying dynamics. We then compared
   results from three avian point count datasets to evaluate the likelihood
   that TE confounds estimates of dynamics for 19 species under a popular
   sampling protocol.
   3. Simulated experiments indicated that when secondary periods were open
   to TE, presence of dynamics was correctly identified 95.1\% of the time,
   and dynamic rate estimates were accurate. However, dynamic rate
   estimates were biased when secondary periods were closed to TE. In
   empirical datasets, dynamic occupancy models had greater support than
   closed models for all species when secondary sampling periods occurred
   in immediate succession (i.e. 3 samples within 10min); however, our
   results suggest that this is because dynamic estimates were heavily
   influenced by TE. When counts within a primary period were separated by
   24-48hr, we found evidence of dynamics for less than half of these
   species. We recommend an alternative sampling approach that allows
   accurate estimation of dynamic rates when TE is of no interest, and
   introduce a novel model for estimating both processes simultaneously in
   rare cases where they are both of biological interest.
   4. Concern for violating the occupancy modelling closure assumption has
   led to widespread recommendations that samples within primary periods be
   conducted extremely close in time. However, this may not be the best
   approach when interest is in quantifying dynamic rates. While dynamic
   occupancy models provide estimates of colonization and extinction, these
   values do not inherently represent dynamics unless TE has been
   explicitly modelled or accounted for with sampling design. Naivete to
   this fact can result in incorrect conclusions about biological
   processes.}},

Title = {{Using taxonomic consistency with semi-automated data pre-processing for
   high quality DNA barcodes}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1878-1887}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. In recent years, large-scale DNA barcoding campaigns have generated
   an enormous amount of COI barcodes, which are usually stored in NCBI's
   GenBank and the official Barcode of Life database (BOLD). BOLD data are
   generally associated with more detailed and better curated meta-data,
   because a great proportion is based on expert-verified and vouchered
   material, accessible in public collections. In the course of the
   initiative German Barcode of Life data were generated for the reference
   library of 2,846 species of Coleoptera from 13,516 individuals.
   2. Confronted with the high effort associated with the identification,
   verification and data validation, a bioinformatic pipeline, TaxCI was
   developed that (1) identifies taxonomic inconsistencies in a given tree
   topology (optionally including a reference dataset), (2) discriminates
   between different cases of incongruence in order to identify
   contamination or misidentified specimens, (3) graphically marks those
   cases in the tree, which finally can be checked again and, if needed,
   corrected or removed from the dataset. For this, TaxCI may use DNA-based
   species delimitations from other approaches (e.g. mPTP) or may perform
   implemented threshold-based clustering.
   3. The data-processing pipeline was tested on a newly generated set of
   barcodes, using the available BOLD records as a reference. A data
   revision based on the first run of the TaxCI tool resulted in the second
   TaxCI analysis in a taxonomic match ratio very similar to the one
   recorded from the reference set (92\% vs. 94\%). The revised dataset
   improved by nearly 20\% through this procedure compared to the original,
   uncorrected one.
   4. Overall, the new processing pipeline for DNA barcode data allows for
   the rapid and easy identification of inconsistencies in large datasets,
   which can be dealt with before submitting them to public data
   repositories like BOLD or GenBank. Ultimately, this will increase the
   quality of submitted data and the speed of data submission, while
   primarily avoiding the deterioration of the accuracy of the data
   repositories due to ambiguously identified or contaminated specimens.}},

Title = {{Trait-fitness relationships determine how trade-off shapes affect

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3188-3198}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Trade-offs between functional traits are ubiquitous in nature and can
   promote species coexistence depending on their shape. Classic theory
   predicts that convex trade-offs facilitate coexistence of specialized
   species with extreme trait values (extreme species) while concave
   trade-offs promote species with intermediate trait values (intermediate
   species). We show here that this prediction becomes insufficient when
   the traits translate non-linearly into fitness which frequently occurs
   in nature, e.g., an increasing length of spines reduces grazing losses
   only up to a certain threshold resulting in a saturating or sigmoid
   trait-fitness function. We present a novel, general approach to evaluate
   the effect of different trade-off shapes on species coexistence. We
   compare the trade-off curve to the invasion boundary of an intermediate
   species invading the two extreme species. At this boundary, the invasion
   fitness is zero. Thus, it separates trait combinations where invasion is
   or is not possible. The invasion boundary is calculated based on
   measurable trait-fitness relationships. If at least one of these
   relationships is not linear, the invasion boundary becomes non-linear,
   implying that convex and concave trade-offs not necessarily lead to
   different coexistence patterns. Therefore, we suggest a new ecological
   classification of trade-offs into extreme-favoring and
   intermediate-favoring which differs from a purely mathematical
   description of their shape. We apply our approach to a well-established
   model of an empirical predator-prey system with competing prey types
   facing a trade-off between edibility and half-saturation constant for
   nutrient uptake. We show that the survival of the intermediate prey
   depends on the convexity of the trade-off. Overall, our approach
   provides a general tool to make a priori predictions on the outcome of
   competition among species facing a common trade-off in dependence of the
   shape of the trade-off and the shape of the trait-fitness relationships.}},

Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Mesic savannas are dominated by trees that are strong resprouters caught
   in a frequent fire trap. Persistence within this fire trap has been
   described by a resprout curve of SizeNextf(Pre-fire size), defined by
   the Michaelis-Menten function. A key feature of this resprout curve is a
   stable persistence equilibrium that represents the size of individual
   plants upon which a population will converge over successive inter-fire
   time steps under a given fire regime. Here, we contend that such a
   resprout curve does not adequately describe resprout tree dynamics in
   frequently burnt mesic savannas because it is constrained to an
   asymptote. We propose a new framework for modelling the resprout curve,
   which recognizes that local environmental stochasticity and growth
   patterns can interact to change the growth response function entirely,
   and thus more readily reflect the range of feasible resprout responses.
   Importantly, we define an unstable equilibrium representing the size
   above which individuals have escaped the fire trap and explore
   mechanisms that can shift an individual from persistence to escape.
   Through a case study from northern Australia, we confirm that our
   framework provides a simple yet practical approach to defining these
   critical aspects of savanna tree growth dynamics: persistence and
   escape.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying which introduced species have the greatest potential for

   were identified. Group A includes species with medium-high establishment

   priority for eradication. Group B includes species with a medium-low
   establishment risk but given the low number of known population and the

Abstract = {{Recent advances have made it possible to analyze high-throughput
   marker-gene sequencing data without resorting to the customary
   construction of molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs): clusters
   of sequencing reads that differ by less than a fixed dissimilarity

   sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved exactly, down to the level of
   single-nucleotide differences over the sequenced gene region. The
   benefits of finer resolution are immediately apparent, and arguments for
   ASV methods have focused on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but
   we believe more important, are the broad benefits that derive from the
   status of ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning

   these features grant ASVs the combined advantages of closed-reference
   OTUs-including computational costs that scale linearly with study size,
   simple merging between independently processed data sets, and forward
   prediction -and of de novo OTUs-including accurate measurement of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2891-2902}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{AimMultivariate mixture models offer the ability to streamline the
   typically multi-stage process of vegetation classification and mapping
   into a single, simultaneous analytical step. Our aim is to demonstrate
   the model's utility over large and diverse areas, with comparison to
   existing classification and mapping conventions.
   LocationNew South Wales, Australia.
   MethodsWe demonstrate a statistical model that uses both multivariate
   species data and environmental covariate data to simultaneously classify
   observations into groups and predict those groups out into environmental
   and geographical space. We used two large data sets to demonstrate the
   method: an similar to 810,000km(2) area with 4,715 sites and 488 species
   and a similar to 220,000km(2) area with 5,183 sites and 446 species. A
   range of topographic, terrain, climate and soil predictors were used as
   environmental variables, including future projected climate variables.
   Models can be fit with the R package RCPmod.
   ResultsThe method results in probabilistic memberships to vegetation
   assemblages, for both the classification and map. There was general
   agreement between our approach and existing vegetation classification
   conventions, but we explore some notable differences. We were able to
   examine the environmental gradients that define the predicted vegetation
   distributions, as well as make predictions about how the distribution of
   species assemblages might shift as a result of climate change.
   Main conclusionsOur approach tightens the link between description of
   biodiversity patterns and their depiction in space, by considering both
   biotic and spatially explicit abiotic information simultaneously. The
   method allows uncertainty to be quantified objectively across a
   consistent set of groups for both vegetation classification and mapping,
   which is rarely the case in traditional multi-stage approaches. A
   simultaneous modelling approach increases capacity to make predictions
   into varying spatial, temporal and environmental dimensions, providing
   new ecological insights and increasing capacity for evidence-based
   decision making.}},

Abstract = {{In 1998, a riparian restoration demonstration project was initiated with
   a target of efficiently establishing a dynamic patch mosaic of
   vegetation communities along a regulated river using available water and
   sediment and remaining natural hydrological processes. A point bar along
   the Middle Rio Grande, Albuquerque, New Mexico, dominated by the
   non-native shrub Elaeagnus angustifolia (Russian olive), was
   mechanically treated by removing all vegetation and lowering a portion
   of the bar to allow overbank flooding during typical spring releases
   from an upstream dam (Cochiti Dam). Side channels and small islands were
   engineered in the lowered bar to slow flood waters, aid sediment
   deposition, and add site complexity. After treatment, a high-resolution
   monitoring grid was installed to track vegetation changes. Following an
   initial flood in the spring of 1998, over 10,000 cottonwoods per ha
   naturally established, but densities varied based on the fluvial
   landforms. Zones that were sufficiently wetted or naturally formed
   behind large woody debris were the most successful, while the artificial
   fill zone and the portion of the bar not lowered had the least native
   riparian tree recruitment. Over 15 years, cottonwood numbers declined
   through intraspecific competition and beaver browsing at all sites, but
   they continued to dominate. Natives also dominated a species-rich
   herbaceous layer, particularly on the lowered sites. The incursion of a
   new herbaceous invader, Saccharum ravennae (ravennagrass), was an
   unexpected outcome revealed by the long-term monitoring record. Yet,
   based on several criteria, the site reflects a successful application of
   a natural-process approach to restoration that can lead to increased

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1592-1604}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Climate-associated changes in forest composition have been widely
   reported, particularly where changes in abiotic conditions have resulted
   in high mortality of sensitive species and have disproportionately
   favoured certain species better adapted to these newer conditions. In
   the north-eastern USA and south-eastern Canada, few studies have
   examined climate-related influences associated with forest composition,
   and none have considered broad-scale changes over a long temporal (>25
   years) period.
   2. We used US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data from
   1983 to 2014 across four north-eastern states (Maine, New Hampshire, New
   York and Vermont) to assess temporal and spatial changes in the
   occurrence and abundance of American beech Fagus grandifolia Ehrh, sugar
   maple Acer saccharum L., red maple Acer rubrum L. and birch Betula spp.
   saplings. We also tested the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on
   the distribution of the four studied deciduous species over the entire
   period examined.
   3. Occurrence and abundance of American beech have increased
   substantially over the past three decades, whereas the occurrence and
   abundance of three other deciduous species have decreased in all
   ecological provinces of the north-eastern USA, except the Midwest
   Broadleaf ecological province. Consequently, a clear shift in species
   composition is currently underway in the beech-maple-birch (BMB) forests
   of the north-eastern USA, with uncertain consequences for future
   ecosystem structure and function.
   4. In the studied region and over the entire period examined, the
   distribution of increased occurrence and abundance of beech relative to
   the three other deciduous species were associated with higher
   temperature and precipitation as well as higher conspecific basal area
   and dead tree basal area.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The change from beech-maple-birch forests
   to more beech-dominated forests with beech encroachment to new forest
   areas across the north-eastern USA may continue if higher intensity
   harvesting and disturbances (i.e. large-scale canopy openings) do not
   occur. This would be a significant management concern as beech is
   associated with a widespread bark disease, is commercially less
   desirable, and can limit natural regeneration from other species. Our
   results emphasize the need for management strategies such as higher
   intensity harvesting methods, vegetation control and limiting browsing
   pressure to reduce beech dominance.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2033-2042}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Atlas data provide biodiversity information at a relatively fine
   spatial grain over a broad spatial extent and, increasingly, at multiple
   points in time, which make them invaluable for understanding processes
   that affect species distributions over time. The effect of survey effort
   on species detection has long been appreciated and Atlases typically
   include survey standards and records of effort, but challenges remain in
   analysing Atlas data that have not been collected using a repeated
   sampling protocol designed to correct for imperfect detection.
   2. We developed a single-visit dynamic occupancy model to quantify the
   effects of climatic and land-use drivers on local species extinction and
   colonization while accounting for imperfect detection using repeat Atlas
   data. We evaluated model stability using data simulated under
   alternative scenarios and, ultimately, applied the model to empirical
   data for Canada warbler Cardellina canadensis, a wide-spread species
   exhibiting a long-term population decline.
   3. At sample sizes that are realistic for many Atlases (n = 1000-10 000
   independent survey blocks), our models produced unbiased estimates of
   detection, occupancy, colonization and extinction parameters. Slope
   estimates for explanatory covariates were somewhat less stable than
   overall occupancy, colonization and extinction rates, with covariate
   effects being sensitive to the total number of, and relationships among,
   explanatory variables.
   4. In comparison to other analyses of Canada warbler distributions that
   indicated minor changes over time, our approach identified a widespread
   decline in occupancy probability across New York, consistent with the
   broader population trend, particularly in the areas where it was
   initially more likely to occur.
   5. Synthesis and applications. A single-visit dynamic occupancy model is
   a novel method for analysing common, ecologically valuable datasets,
   such as Atlases, that lack repeated sampling necessary to correct for
   imperfect detection using alternative multi-season occupancy modelling
   approaches. As a result, using this method can improve understanding of
   species distributions and factors that shape them over time, thereby
   providing more accurate information to guide conservation and
   management.}},

   inspection and surveillance), whilst commercial enterprises cover the
   costs of ongoing management of established pests and pathogens. The
   costs of responding to new outbreaks tend to be shared with government
   or regional authorities organising initial response but owners covering
   subsequent operational costs without state compensation. However in
   recent years a number of major epidemics have devastated natural
   ecosystems and landscapes valued both for timber and for their wider
   benefits to the general public. Against this background it is helpful to
   consider more explicitly the consequences of pests and pathogens for the
   full range of ecosystem services. Biodiversity was originally perceived
   to be an ecosystem service but is now recognised as fundamental in
   supporting ecological function. Many ecosystem services are uncosted and
   enjoyed by a range of stakeholders raising important questions about who
   is responsible for measures to protect tree health. We present data here
   on the new outbreaks which have occurred in the UK and, as an example of
   rapid spread of a disease, on the development of Hymenoscyphus fraxineus
   in the UK over the last 3 years. These data indicate that tree pests and
   diseases represent a major contemporary problem to which the ecosystem
   services concept, and its associated implications for cost sharing, can
   move forward our approach to prevention and outbreak management and may
   improve the outcomes of international measures to minimise the
   man-mediated movement and impacts of pests and pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{The underlying ethos of `nature's benefits' contributing to human
   wellbeing provides a common platform for understanding the function and
   value of biodiversity for stakeholders. Diverse societal worldviews
   however create differences in the way cultures relate to and understand
   the environment. The objective of this study was to identify
   community-based indicators and metrics used by MAori in New Zealand to
   monitor forest health and community wellbeing. Eighty semi-directed
   interviews were conducted with 55 forest users within the Tuawhenua
   tribal group to identify forest health indicators and associated
   gradient of metrics to assess each indicator. Indicators were grouped
   within nine culturally-relevant themes: (1) food procurement (mahinga
   kai), (2) natural productivity (hua o te whenua), (3) nature of water
   (Ahua o te wai), (4) nature of the land (Ahua o te whenua), (5) nature
   of the forest (Ahua o te ngahere), (6) perpetual occupation of land and
   place (ahikaaroa), (7) spiritual dimension (taha wairua), (8) physical
   health (taha kikokiko), and (9) mental health (taha hinengaro). Within
   these themes, indicators and associated metrics were aligned within two
   monitoring approaches: field survey and interview-based. Community
   members (n = 35 individuals) were asked to prioritise field survey
   indicators using a seven point Likert Scale of importance. A second
   survey was also conducted with Tuawhenua elders (n = 43 individuals) to
   determine changes in the frequency of forest use by the community. A
   decline in the proportion of the community venturing into the forest
   over the last 60 years for activities such as hunting, fishing, camping,
   and collecting plant resources was reported. This decline in regular
   forest use suggests a field survey approach would be an effective method
   for applying community-based indicators and to gain an understanding of
   forest health. Forest indicators that are evaluated over a longer
   timeframe (months, seasons or even years), or those indicators aligned
   with community wellbeing, would be better evaluated using an
   interview-based approach. The alignment of some community-based
   indicators with scientific-based measures would enrich and deepen
   knowledge about the state of biodiversity, broaden the relevance of
   monitoring and reporting within indigenous communities, and help to
   mitigate issues of `shifting baselines'.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Effective management of biodiversity in human-modified landscapes
   demands an understanding of how biotas respond to landscape features and
   management actions. Yet, biotic responses are complex and varied,
   resulting in numerous conceptual models being developed to aid
   interpretation and generalization. We examined the relevance of a range
   of conceptual landscape models that describe how the distribution of
   habitat influences species richness, abundance, occurrence and spatial
   dynamics, using an empirical data set of reptile and frog responses to
   agricultural management.
   Location: South-eastern New South Wales, Australia.
   Methods: We tested predictions developed from five conceptual landscape
   models using data collected from five land cover types and two grazing
   regimes.
   Results: At least one species responded in a manner consistent with each
   of the five conceptual models tested. Most species responded to
   gradients of environmental variables and species-specific responses were
   observed, in congruence with the Continuum model. No species were
   consistently congruent with predictions from concepts of Island
   Biogeography theory. One-third of responses were congruent with the
   Matrix Quality model. The main prediction tested from the Matrix
   Tolerance model was upheld by both reptile and frog species. The
   predictions of the Habitat Amount hypothesis were upheld by rare reptile
   abundance and richness, and one frog species.
   Main conclusions: Our study suggests that most conceptual models have
   some relevance to real-world systems and can be useful for interpreting
   biotic responses to landscape change and management. Importantly, no one
   model fully captured the range of species responses to our agricultural
   landscape, but the Continuum model, Matrix Quality model, Matrix
   Tolerance model and Habitat Amount hypothesis had complementary
   predictions that together appeared to explain most of the assemblage's
   responses to the management and environmental conditions of the
   agricultural landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: For many species, the effects of landscape change can involve a
   time-lag and result in an extinction debt. The landscape matrix plays a
   vital role in supporting species populations. However, the importance of
   the historical composition and configuration of landscape mosaics has
   received little attention, with studies focusing on the effects of loss
   and fragmentation of single (focal) habitat over time. We investigated
   the importance of historical and contemporary landscape heterogeneity
   (composition and configuration) to identify how landscape change has,
   and is continuing to have, an effect on current woodland carabid
   communities.
   Location: Lowland Britain.
   Methods: Carabids were sampled from woodlands in 36 tetrads of 4km(2).
   Ordination methods analysed current community response to
   representations of contemporary and historical (1930s) landscape
   heterogeneity. The effects of 80years of landscape change on current
   carabid assemblages were compared among tetrads.
   Results: Results are consistent with an extinction debt; carabid
   communities correlated significantly with the historical composition and
   configuration of the landscape, but not contemporary landscape
   configuration. Community assemblages have been shaped, and many species
   remain affiliated with landscape conditions that no longer exist,
   notably, large patches of broadleaf woodland and semi-natural grassland.
   Recent introduction of conifer plantations has had a negative effect on
   the abundance of many woodland species. For many common, slow-dispersing
   species, contemporary and historical landscapes offered sub-optimum
   woodland coverage indicating a lag effect that exceeds 80years.
   Increased arable land cover and loss of semi-natural grassland and
   heathland points towards an ongoing detrimental impact on carabid
   populations.
   Main conclusions: Compared with focal-habitat studies, the landscape
   mosaic approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the
   effects of widespread landscape change on species communities.
   Conservation guidance includes new planting, maintenance and restoration
   of semi-natural habitats, implemented across multiple spatial scales and
   where feasible, considering both historical and contemporary landscape
   heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{The future of the Amazon rainforest is unknown due to uncertainties in
   projected climate change and the response of the forest to this change
   (forest resiliency). Here, we explore the effect of some uncertainties
   in climate and land surface processes on the future of the forest, using
   a perturbed physics ensemble of HadCM3C. This is the first time Amazon
   forest changes are presented using an ensemble exploring both land
   vegetation processes and physical climate feedbacks in a fully coupled
   modelling framework. Under three different emissions scenarios, we
   measure the change in the forest coverage by the end of the 21st century
   (the transient response) and make a novel adaptation to a previously
   used method known as dry-season resilience to predict the long-term
   committed response of the forest, should the state of the climate remain
   constant past 2100. Our analysis of this ensemble suggests that there
   will be a high chance of greater forest loss on longer timescales than
   is realized by 2100, especially for mid-range and low emissions
   scenarios. In both the transient and predicted committed responses,
   there is an increasing uncertainty in the outcome of the forest as the
   strength of the emissions scenarios increases. It is important to note
   however, that very few of the simulations produce future forest loss of
   the magnitude previously shown under the standard model configuration.
   We find that low optimum temperatures for photosynthesis and a high
   minimum leaf area index needed for the forest to compete for space
   appear to be precursors for dieback. We then decompose the uncertainty
   into that associated with future climate change and that associated with
   forest resiliency, finding that it is important to reduce the
   uncertainty in both of these if we are to better determine the Amazon's
   outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) is a significant pest of onion worldwide,
   causing both direct and indirect damage to the crop. Integrated pest
   management of onion thrips should improve profitability and
   sustainability of onion production. Promising management approaches
   include reducing nitrogen application rates, using thrips-resistant
   cultivars and implementing action threshold-based insecticide programs.
   However, the impact of these integrated pest management approaches on
   thrips densities and damage, crop yield, and thrips-associated plant
   diseases like iris yellow spot (IYS) (caused by Iris yellow spot virus)
   and bacterial center rot (caused by Pantoea agglomerans and P. ananatis)
   remains largely unknown. In a two-year field trial in New York,
   combinations of varying levels of nitrogen applied at planting (67, 101
   and 140 kg ha(-1)) and different insecticide programs (standard weekly
   insecticide program and action threshold-based insecticide program) were
   evaluated for onion thrips management in onion cultivars that had
   moderate resistance (`Avalon'), low resistance ('Delgado') and no
   resistance (`Bradley') to onion thrips. Results indicated that
   regardless of cultivar, nitrogen did not affect larval thrips densities,
   onion yields, IYS or bacterial center rot. Across all cultivars,
   insecticide use (both programs) significantly reduced larval thrips
   densities and damage, IYS severity and incidence, and increased onion
   yield. Insecticide use did not consistently affect the incidence of
   bacterial center rot. Both insecticide programs reduced onion thrips
   larval densities by 60-81\% relative to the untreated control, but the
   action threshold-based application program used 2.8 fewer applications
   than the standard program. `Avalon' had low thrips densities and IYS
   disease, but required the same number of insecticide applications as
   `Bradley'. Onion yields in both insecticide programs were statistically
   similar in both years, and bulb weights averaged 10-54\% more than those
   in the untreated control. Our results indicated that growers can reduce
   nitrogen levels at planting and insecticide use without compromising
   control of either onion thrips or IYS disease or onion bulb yields.}},

Abstract = {{For over thirty years the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) has been used
   to evaluate economic performance, quantify benefits and costs of growth,
   and predict effects of policy changes on economic wellbeing. The
   popularity and use of the metric is increasing partially in response to
   new global demands for metrics that go beyond Gross Domestic Product
   (GDP). However, because the basic GPI accounting protocols have yet to
   be consistently updated to respond to theoretical critiques, new
   valuation methods, and new data sources a proliferation of studies at
   the global, national and sub-national level contain widely divergent
   Methodologies. Because of this, GPI practitioners have called for a new,
   consistent framework to guide future GPI studies - GPI 2.0. This paper

   from GPI 2.0 deliberations online and at recent workshops in the form of
   GPI 2.0 pilot accounts for the US, State of Maryland, and City of

Abstract = {{The occurrence and location of long-term refugia determine the current
   patterns of biodiversity on Earth. The importance of the refugial debate
   is certain to increase in response to observed and expected species
   extinctions caused by climate change. Small areas where species survive
   outside their core range are important, as unique natural phenomena and
   model systems for observing the response of species to climate change.
   They can play a crucial role as potential sources for species recovery
   in the future or can act as progenitors of a new species. While most
   authors believe that sites connected with only long-term isolation
   should be included into the refugium concept, this approach can result
   in the loss of linkage between the ecological and evolutionary processes
   taking place during different phases of the species range dynamics.
   Moreover, the papers often interpret the nature of described phenomena
   in different ways. In response, the conceptual scheme given in our
   letter summarises the patterns which occur during species range shift.
   It proposes an equivalent scheme for small refugial sites according to
   their function and capacity, based on the relict species concept. This
   approach and proposed terminology is tested on the example of two plant
   species with different pattern of the long term range dynamics. Our
   paper highlights the importance of sites harboring `trailing-edge' young
   relicts for the future long-term persistence of the species (as old
   relicts) under unfavorable regional conditions. By considering the age
   gradients of small refugial sites it is possible to reveal community
   interactions, species traits or genes that drive the responses of biota
   to climate changes.}},

Abstract = {{Andean farmers have always faced high levels of climate-related risk and

Abstract = {{Question: Frequent severe wildfires have the potential to alter the
   structure and composition of forests in temperate biomes. While
   temperate forests dominated by resprouting trees are thought to be
   largely invulnerable to more frequent wildfires, empirical data to
   support this assumption are lacking. Does frequent fire erode tree
   persistence by increasing mortality and reducing regeneration, and what
   are the broader impacts on forest structure and understorey composition?
   Location: Sub-alpine open Eucalyptus pauciflora forests, Australian
   Alps, Victoria, Australia.
   Methods: We examined tree persistence and understorey composition of E.
   pauciflora open forests that were unburned, burned once, twice or three
   times by high-severity wildfires between 2003 and 2013. At each of 20
   sites (five per fire frequency class) we assessed extent of top-kill and
   mortality of eucalypt clumps, spatial configuration of surviving and
   dead clumps, densities of new and ligno-tuberous eucalypt seedlings, and
   shrub and grass cover.
   Results: At least 2 yr after the last wildfire, proportions of
   top-killed E. pauciflora stems were significantly higher, and densities
   of live basal resprouts significantly lower, at sites burned two or
   three times compared to once burned or unburned sites. Clump death
   increased to 50\% of individuals at sites burned by three short-interval
   wildfires, which led to changes in live tree patchiness, as indicated by
   nearest-neighbour indices. Increased tree mortality was not offset by
   seedling recruitment, which was significantly lower at the twice-and
   thrice-burned sites relative to single-burn sites - although seedling
   recruitment was also influenced by topography and coarse woody debris.
   In addition to changes in the tree layer, the prominence of understorey
   shrubs was substantially reduced, and the frequency of grasses markedly
   increased, after two, and particularly three wildfires.
   Conclusions: Our study provides strong empirical evidence of
   ecologically significant change in E. pauciflora forests after
   short-interval severe wildfires, namely, erosion of the persistence
   niche of resprouting trees, and a shift in understorey dominance from
   shrubs to grasses. Our findings highlight the need to consider the
   impacts of compounded perturbation on forests under changing climates,
   including testing assumptions of long-term persistence of
   resprouter-dominated communities.}},

Abstract = {{Earthworms, as ecosystem engineers, help to mineralize soil organic
   matter, construct and maintain soil structure, and often stimulate plant
   growth and protect plants from pests. The aim of this study was (i) to
   determine the connection between earthworm traits and indicators of soil
   ecosystem services and (ii) to identify earthworm ``response{''} traits,
   which are selected by the landscape or changes in the soil, and
   ``effect{''} traits, which contribute to soil processes. In the southern
   portion of the state of Para (eastern Brazilian Amazonia), we sampled
   earthworms at 135 points distributed among 3 locations, 9 sub locations
   and 27 farms (5 sampling points per farm). At each point, three 25 cm x
   25 cm soil samples were hand-sorted for earthworms. We measured eight
   functional traits in 1148 individuals: relative gizzard size, type of
   typhlosole, length and type of caudal setae, pigmentation, overall
   length, thickness of septa and musculature in anterior segments. We
   found a significant, although relatively low, relationship between
   landscape classes and trait proportions. Earthworm trait proportions
   significantly covaried with soil parameters and indicators of soil
   ecosystem services. We did not find significant covariation between
   earthworm morphospecies and soil ecosystem services. We identified
   earthworm ``response{''} traits that had been selected and assessed
   consequences of these changes on effects of earthworm communities (via

   Typhlosole type, gizzard size and septa thickness were identified as
   ``response{''} traits selected by soil and landscape conditions. These
   traits were also identified as ``effect{''} traits for their influence

Title = {{Nonlinearity, fuzziness and incommensurability in indicator-based
   assessments of vulnerability to climate change: A new mathematical
   framework}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{82}},

Abstract = {{The earth's climate system is highly nonlinear and the vulnerability of
   a community to a climate hazard is no exception. While this fact is
   widely accepted, indicator-based vulnerability assessments (IBVA) hardly
   ever take such nonlinearities into account. This is mainly due to the
   fact that the majority of assessment studies use methods based on
   Multiple Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) (e.g. simple additive weight or
   multiplicative aggregation) to aggregate indicators. These methods
   convert all indicators into a global utility function and produce only a
   linear, threshold-free scaling of the effects of an indicator on
   vulnerability. In a previous paper, we showed that outranking procedures
   developed in decision-making science offer a more theoretically-sound
   approach to aggregation because they allow the analyst to incorporate
   the incommensurability, fuzziness and uncertainty associated with
   indicators. In this paper, we develop a new mathematical framework for
   vulnerability in order to clearly identify various sources of
   nonlinearity and incommensurability in vulnerability assessments. We
   then propose a new outranking formulation which can accommodate both and
   can be used to conduct assessments at different scales. We do so by
   introducing the concept of harm criterion as a mediator between an
   indicator-and the vulnerability it represents. The new assessment
   approach can aggregate a mix of indicators with various degrees of
   subjectivity and non-linearity, without converting them into a single
   utility function and without requiring them to be mutually compensating.
   We illustrate the proposed approach by applying it to a simplified model
   of urban vulnerability to heat, focusing on the non-linear relationship
   between mortality and temperature above a `comfort temperature', long
   evidenced in the epidemiological literature. We compare vulnerability
   rankings yielded by linear and non-linear characterizations of the
   relationship between temperature and mortality and find that the
   incorporation of non linearity can have a significant impact on the
   rankings.}},

Abstract = {{A critical hydrologic process in arid and semiarid regions is the
   interaction between ephemeral channels and groundwater aquifers.
   Generally, it has been found that ephemeral channels contribute to
   groundwater recharge when streamflow infiltrates into the sandy bottoms
   of channels. This process has traditionally been studied in channels
   that drain large areas (tens to hundreds of square kilometers). Since
   the water table in arid and semiarid regions is typically far from the
   surface, measured streamflow losses or percolation into the deep vadose
   zone is equated to groundwater recharge. In this study, we use a water
   balance approach to estimate deep percolation in a first-order,
   instrumented watershed (4.7 ha) on a piedmont slope of the Jornada
   Experimental Range (JER) in the Chihuahuan Desert. Results indicate that
   runoff generated within the piedmont slope contributes significantly to
   deep percolation. During the short-term 6-yr study period, we estimated
   385 mm of total percolation, 62 mm/yr, or a ratio of percolation to
   rainfall of 0.26. Based on the instrument network, we identified that
   percolation occurs inside channel areas when these receive overland
   sheetflow from hillslopes. We observed less streamflow leaving the
   watershed as compared to percolation during the study period, leading to
   an outlet streamflow to rainfall ratio of 0.02. Using long-term data
   sets available from the JER, we estimate that over the last 100 yr, 48
   mm/yr of percolation occurs at the study site, a ratio of percolation to
   rainfall of 0.19. We then scale this up to determine the contribution of
   similarly sized watersheds on the piedmont slopes of the JER. These
   observations highlight the importance of arid piedmont slopes for
   generating groundwater recharge, in particular during above-average
   rainfall periods.}},

Abstract = {{In the current context of global change and human-induced biodiversity
   decline, there is an urgent need for developing sampling approaches able
   to accurately describe the state of biodiversity. Traditional surveys of
   vertebrate fauna involve time-consuming and skill-demanding field
   methods. Recently, the use of DNA derived from invertebrate parasites
   (leeches and blowflies) was suggested as a new tool for vertebrate
   diversity assessment. Bloodmeal analyses of arthropod disease vectors
   have long been performed to describe their feeding behaviour, for
   epidemiological purposes. On the other hand, this existing expertise has
   not yet been applied to investigate vertebrate fauna per se. Here, we
   evaluate the usefulness of hematophagous dipterans as vertebrate
   samplers. Blood-fed sand flies and mosquitoes were collected in
   Amazonian forest sites and analysed using high-throughput sequencing of
   short mitochondrial markers. Bloodmeal identifications highlighted
   contrasting ecological features and feeding behaviour among dipteran
   species, which allowed unveiling arboreal and terrestrial mammals of
   various body size, as well as birds, lizards and amphibians.
   Additionally, lower vertebrate diversity was found in sites undergoing
   higher levels of human-induced perturbation. These results suggest that,
   in addition to providing precious information on disease vector host
   use, dipteran bloodmeal analyses may represent a useful tool in the
   study of vertebrate communities. Although further effort is required to
   validate the approach and consider its application to large-scale
   studies, this first work opens up promising perspectives for
   biodiversity monitoring and eco-epidemiology.}},

Abstract = {{Resilience is increasingly being considered as a new paradigm of forest
   management among scientists, practitioners, and policymakers. However,
   metrics of resilience to environmental change are lacking. Faced with
   novel disturbances, forests may be able to sustain existing ecosystem
   services and biodiversity by exhibiting resilience, or alternatively
   these attributes may undergo either a linear or nonlinear decline. Here
   we provide a novel quantitative approach for assessing forest resilience
   that focuses on three components of resilience, namely resistance,
   recovery, and net change, using a spatially explicit model of forest
   dynamics. Under the pulse set scenarios, we explored the resilience of
   nine ecosystem services and four biodiversity measures following a
   one-off disturbance applied to an increasing percentage of forest area.
   Under the pulse+press set scenarios, the six disturbance intensities
   explored during the pulse set were followed by a continuous disturbance.
   We detected thresholds in net change under pulse+press scenarios for the
   majority of the ecosystem services and biodiversity measures, which
   started to decline sharply when disturbance affected >40\% of the
   landscape. Thresholds in net change were not observed under the pulse
   scenarios, with the exception of timber volume and ground flora species
   richness. Thresholds were most pronounced for aboveground biomass,
   timber volume with respect to the ecosystem services, and
   ectomycorrhizal fungi and ground flora species richness with respect to
   the biodiversity measures. Synthesis and applications. The approach
   presented here illustrates how the multidimensionality of stability
   research in ecology can be addressed and how forest resilience can be
   estimated in practice. Managers should adopt specific management actions
   to support each of the three components of resilience separately, as
   these may respond differently to disturbance. In addition, management
   interventions aiming to deliver resilience should incorporate an
   assessment of both pulse and press disturbances to ensure detection of
   threshold responses to disturbance, so that appropriate management
   interventions can be identified.}},

Abstract = {{Global change alters the composition and functioning of ecosystems by
   creating novel environmental conditions and thereby selecting for

   tools to more mechanistically understand compositional and functional

Abstract = {{Population genetic data from multiple taxa can address comparative
   phylogeographic questions about community-scale response to
   environmental shifts, and a useful strategy to this end is to employ
   hierarchical co-demographic models that directly test multi-taxa
   hypotheses within a single, unified analysis. This approach has been
   applied to classical phylogeographic data sets such as mitochondrial
   barcodes as well as reduced-genome polymorphism data sets that can yield
   10,000s of SNPs, produced by emergent technologies such as RAD-seq and
   GBS. A strategy for the latter had been accomplished by adapting the
   site frequency spectrum to a novel summarization of population genomic
   data across multiple taxa called the aggregate site frequency spectrum
   (aSFS), which potentially can be deployed under various inferential
   frameworks including approximate Bayesian computation, random forest and
   composite likelihood optimization. Here, we introduce the r package
   multi-dice, a wrapper program that exploits existing simulation software
   for flexible execution of hierarchical model-based inference using the
   aSFS, which is derived from reduced genome data, as well as
   mitochondrial data. We validate several novel software features such as
   applying alternative inferential frameworks, enforcing a minimal
   threshold of time surrounding co-demographic pulses and specifying
   flexible hyperprior distributions. In sum, multi-dice provides
   comparative analysis within the familiar R environment while allowing a
   high degree of user customization, and will thus serve as a tool for
   comparative phylogeography and population genomics.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is causing physical and biological changes in the polar
   marine environment, which may impact higher trophic level predators such
   as the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) and the structure of their
   food webs. We used bulk stable isotope analysis and compound-specific
   isotope analysis (CSIA) of individual amino acids (AA) to examine
   bowhead whale trophic position and the biogeochemistry of one of their
   feeding grounds, Disko Bay, West Greenland, over a period of 7 years
   (2007-2013). We also examined whether environmental conditions such as
   sea ice concentration and sea surface temperature were causing any
   interannual variation in isotope data. Bulk delta N-15 values were
   consistent across the 7 years of sampling and were similar between sex
   classes. Bulk delta C-13 and essential-AAs delta C-13 values displayed
   an overall temporal decline of 1.0 and 1.4\%, respectively. A
   significant positive linear relationship was found between delta C-13 of
   bulk skin and essential-AAs suggesting that some of the observed
   isotopic variation in bowhead whales between years reflect changes in
   the carbon at the base of the food web. There were no correlations
   between the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of isotopic tracers with
   sea ice concentrations or sea surface temperatures. The trophic level of
   bowhead whales remained stable over time despite large interannual
   variability in ice and temperature regimes. Our results indicate that
   the recent environmental changes in West Greenland resulted in no
   trophic perturbation being transferred to bowhead whales during that
   time period. Our study shows that the novel approach of CSIA-AA can be
   used effectively to study the combined temporal variation of bowhead
   whale food web structure and ecosystem isotopic baseline values and
   detect changes at the species and ecosystem levels.}},

Abstract = {{Hawaiian forest birds are imperiled, with fewer than half the original
   >40 species remaining extant. Recent studies document ongoing rapid
   population decline and project complete climate-based range losses for
   the critically endangered Kaua'i endemics `akeke'e (Loxops
   caeruleirostris) and `akikiki (Oreomystis bairdi) by end-of-century due
   to projected warming. Climate change facilitates the upward expansion of
   avian malaria into native high elevation forests where disease was
   historically absent. While intensified conservation efforts attempt to
   safeguard these species and their habitats, the magnitude of potential
   loss and the urgency of this situation require all conservation options
   to be seriously considered. One option for Kaua'i endemics is
   translocation to islands with higher elevation habitats. We explored the
   feasibility of interisland translocation by projecting baseline and
   future climate-based ranges of `akeke'e and `akikiki across the Hawaiian
   archipelago. For islands where compatible climates for these species
   were projected to endure through end-of-century, an additional climatic
   niche overlap analysis compares the spatial overlap between Kaua'i
   endemics and current native species on prospective destination islands.
   Suitable climate-based ranges exist on Maui and Hawai'i for these Kaua'i
   endemics that offer climatically distinct areas compared to niche
   distributions of destination island endemics. While we recognize that
   any decision to translocate birds will include assessing numerous
   additional social, political, and biological factors, our focus on
   locations of enduring and ecologically compatible climate-based ranges
   represents the first step to evaluate this potential conservation
   option. Our approach considering baseline and future distributions of
   species with climatic niche overlap metrics to identify undesirable
   range overlap provides a method that can be utilized for other

Abstract = {{Human-driven global change is causing ongoing declines in biodiversity
   worldwide. In order to address these declines, decision-makers need
   accurate assessments of the status of and pressures on biodiversity.
   However, these are heavily constrained by incomplete and uneven spatial,
   temporal and taxonomic coverage. For instance, data from regions such as
   Europe and North America are currently used overwhelmingly for
   large-scale biodiversity assessments due to lesser availability of
   suitable data from other, more biodiversity-rich, regions. These
   data-poor regions are often those experiencing the strongest threats to
   biodiversity, however. There is therefore an urgent need to fill the
   existing gaps in global biodiversity monitoring. Here, we review current
   knowledge on best practice in capacity building for biodiversity
   monitoring and provide an overview of existing means to improve
   biodiversity data collection considering the different types of
   biodiversity monitoring data. Our review comprises insights from work in
   Africa, South America, Polar Regions and Europe; in government-funded,
   volunteer and citizen-based monitoring in terrestrial, freshwater and
   marine ecosystems. The key steps to effectively building capacity in
   biodiversity monitoring are: identifying monitoring questions and aims;
   identifying the key components, functions, and processes to monitor;
   identifying the most suitable monitoring methods for these elements,
   carrying out monitoring activities; managing the resultant data; and
   interpreting monitoring data. Additionally, biodiversity monitoring
   should use multiple approaches including extensive and intensive
   monitoring through volunteers and professional scientists but also
   harnessing new technologies. Finally, we call on the scientific

Abstract = {{As most regions of the earth transition to altered climatic conditions,
   new methods are needed to identify refugia and other areas whose

   change. We compared several common approaches to conservation planning
   focused on climate resilience over a broad range of ecological settings
   across North America and evaluated how commonalities in the priority
   areas identified by different methods varied with regional context and
   spatial scale. Our results indicate that priority areas based on
   different environmental diversity metrics differed substantially from
   each other and from priorities based on spatiotemporal metrics such as
   climatic velocity. Refugia identified by diversity or velocity metrics
   were not strongly associated with the current protected area system,
   suggesting the need for additional conservation measures including
   protection of refugia. Despite the inherent uncertainties in predicting
   future climate, we found that variation among climatic velocities
   derived from different general circulation models and emissions pathways
   was less than the variation among the suite of environmental diversity
   metrics. To address uncertainty created by this variation, planners can
   combine priorities identified by alternative metrics at a single
   resolution and downweight areas of high variation between metrics.
   Alternately, coarse-resolution velocity metrics can be combined with
   fine-resolution diversity metrics in order to leverage the respective
   strengths of the two groups of metrics as tools for identification of
   potential macro- and microrefugia that in combination maximize both
   transient and long-term resilience to climate change. Planners should
   compare and integrate approaches that span a range of model complexity

   historical biogeography of the tree fern family Dicksoniaceae (145 Ma),
   which has a typical Gondwanan distribution, to test for vicariance or
   recent long-distance dispersal.
   Location: Subtropical, tropical and temperate forests of the Southern
   Hemisphere.
   Methods: We performed a molecular phylogenetic study of the family based
   on four chloroplast markers using Bayesian and maximum likelihood
   inference. Spore fossils served to calibrate the dating of the phylogeny
   using BEAST. The historical biogeography of the family was traced via an
   ancestral area reconstruction using a maximum likelihood approach.
   Results: We corroborated the genus Dicksonia (widespread) as sister to
   Lophosoria (Neotropical), with Calochlaena (Palaeotropical) as sister to
   both. The phylogenetic splits between the genera predate the break-up of
   Gondwana. Lophosoria is currently restricted to America but fossils
   document extinct populations in Australia, Tasmania and Antarctica.
   Within Dicksonia, we found three clades which separated 55-25 Ma: one
   including species from New Caledonia, New Zealand and Fiji; another
   containing species from the Neotropics as well as southern Australia and
   New Zealand; and one with species from northern Australia to the
   Philippines and Sumatra. Vicariance and ancient long-distance dispersal
   can equally explain the occurrence of these three clades on different
   tectonic units of Gondwana. Other geographical disjunctions, for
   example, between Australia and Malesia, are more recent (15-3 Ma) and
   inferred to be the result of long-distance dispersal. The combination of
   fossil evidence and island endemics whose ages predate the ages of the
   islands point to substantial extinction in the genus.
   Main conclusions: The biogeographical history of the family
   Dicksoniaceae, and especially of Dicksonia itself, appears to have
   involved a much more dynamic interplay of vicariance, dispersal and
   extinction than inferred from current distributions alone. Dicksonia is
   one of the few biogeographical Gondwanan floristic elements whose
   current distribution can at least partly be linked to plate tectonic
   events.}},

Abstract = {{Suspended and deposited sediments can negatively impact coral health by
   reducing light penetration and smothering coral tissue. As coral
   sediment thresholds vary among species and between locations, setting
   sediment thresholds for the management of activities that increase
   sediment loads continues to be a challenging goal. Static threshold
   values used to date do not take into account temporal and spatial
   variations in a coral's ability to acclimate to high sediment loads
   leading to either management approaches that are overly conservative or
   do not protect corals. This study presents a numerical model that
   quantifies the relationship between coral photosynthesis and growth
   potential under varying turbidity-driven light regimes. The model
   accounts for coral acclimation potential as well as a dynamic energy
   transfer between host and symbiont using field data collected from
   nearshore reefs in Singapore combined with both established and novel
   mathematical relationships. The model yielded photosynthetic and
   respiratory outputs that were comparable to in situ data collected,
   illustrating the predictive capability of modelling coral growth
   potential to declines in light driven by suspended sediments. The
   inclusion of more than one coral species into the model allows for
   variations in responses to sediments among different coral morphologies
   and taxa, and will strengthen the predictive capacity for management of
   sediment related events. As demonstrated here, the model can be used to
   identify least risk scenarios for dredging operations as a means of both
   conserving coral reefs as well as ensuring cost-effective management
   practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of the recent strong increase in the number of measurements of
   the partial pressure of CO2 in the surface ocean (pCO(2)), the air-sea
   CO2 balance of the continental shelf seas remains poorly quantified.
   This is a consequence of these regions remaining strongly under-sampled
   in both time and space and of surface p CO2 exhibiting much higher
   temporal and spatial variability in these regions compared to the open
   ocean. Here, we use a modified version of a two-step artificial neural
   network method (SOM-FFN; Landschutzer et al., 2013) to interpolate the p
   CO2 data along the continental margins with a spatial resolution of 0.25
   ffi and with monthly resolution from 1998 to 2015. The most important
   modifications compared to the original SOM-FFN method are (i) the much
   higher spatial resolution and (ii) the inclusion of sea ice and wind
   speed as predictors of p CO2. The SOM-FFN is first trained with p CO2
   measurements extracted from the SO-CATv4 database. Then, the validity of
   our interpolation, in both space and time, is assessed by comparing the
   generated pCO(2) field with independent data extracted from the
   LD-VEO2015 database. The new coastal pCO(2) product confirms a
   previously suggested general meridional trend of the annual mean pCO(2)
   in all the continental shelves with high values in the tropics and
   dropping to values beneath those of the atmosphere at higher latitudes.
   The monthly resolution of our data product permits us to reveal
   significant differences in the seasonality of pCO(2) across the ocean
   basins. The shelves of the western and northern Pacific, as well as the
   shelves in the temperate northern Atlantic, display particularly
   pronounced seasonal variations in pCO(2); while the shelves in the
   south-eastern Atlantic and in the southern Pacific reveal a much smaller
   seasonality. The calculation of temperature normalized pCO(2) for
   several latitudes in different oceanic basins confirms that the
   seasonality in shelf pCO(2) cannot solely be explained by
   temperature-induced changes in solubility but are also the result of
   seasonal changes in circulation, mixing and biological productivity. Our
   results also reveal that the amplitudes of both thermal and nonthermal
   seasonal variations in pCO(2) are significantly larger at high
   latitudes. Finally, because this product's spatial extent includes parts
   of the open ocean as well, it can be readily merged with existing global
   open-ocean products to produce a true global perspective of the spatial
   and temporal variability of surface ocean pCO(2).}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{As the ecosystem services concept increasingly gains importance, it
   needs translation into practical applications. Recent efforts of EU
   member states to map ES are opening new opportunities to include ES in
   spatial planning and adaptive land management. For this, spatial
   planners and policy makers need practical tools that integrate a variety
   of social and biophysical information in an accessible way. We argue
   that monetary valuation of ES can contribute to this challenge. A
   methodological framework was developed to explore adaptive management of
   bioproductive space. The first stage in the methodology is a spatially
   explicit evaluation of various ecosystem services for different land
   uses. In a second stage, bio-physical and socio-economic drivers or
   shocks are introduced that can influence the value society attributes to
   specific ecosystem services. The third stage of the methodology takes
   policy priorities into account. In a final stage, the output of the
   approach is synthesised by ranking the analysis results for different
   scenarios and policy priority settings. This methodology allows spatial
   planners to explore and evaluate policy decisions against trade-offs
   between various land use alternatives, while taking ecosystem services
   into account. To demonstrate its use, the methodology is applied to a
   small-scale case study that combines extensive livestock production with
   the development of natural values. The application to the case
   demonstrates that the optimal strategy from a societal perspective, can
   be highly context-dependent. Besides the potential for supporting policy
   makers to think about the broader implications of land use changes for
   community wellbeing, the methodology provides useful feedback for
   adaptive farm and landscape management. We underline both the potential
   and possible caveats in using this approach for land use evaluation.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{65-73}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Biological assessment of aquatic resources requires the availability of
   bioassessment tools that work in all waterbody types and regions of
   interest. Developing new assessment tools may require several years of
   data collection and substantial investment of resources, which may not
   be an option for some aquatic resource managers. Adapting tools
   developed for different regions or wetland types may be an attractive
   alternative to developing new indices, provided they work well in the
   novel setting. In this study, we explore the transferability of two
   bioassessment indices for application to depressional wetlands in
   California, which are wetland type of management concern but for which
   bioassessment tools don't currently exist. We tested the applicability
   of a depressional wetland invertebrate index of biotic integrity (IBI)
   developed in the San Francisco Bay region of northern California for
   application in the drier regions of southern California (i.e. geographic
   transferability), and the ability to apply a riverine benthic diatom IBI
   to benthic diatoms in depressional wetlands (i.e. water body type
   transferability). We evaluated the accuracy and responsiveness of the
   existing Indices for use in depressional wetlands and refined reference
   definitions and recalibrated thresholds relative to stressor gradients
   to maximize index performance. Performance of the adapted indices was
   compared to that of an existing habitat assessment tool (the California
   Rapid Assessment Method; CRAM) that has been developed for statewide
   application of depressional wetlands. Finally, we demonstrate
   application of the revised indices for ambient assessment of
   depressional wetland condition in southern California. Recalibrating
   both the macroinvertebrate and diatom indices to reference thresholds
   based on nutrient concentrations resulted in lower coefficient of
   variation among reference sites, greater differentiation between
   reference and non-reference and stronger relationship with stressors
   than when reference thresholds were based on landscape disturbance.
   Overall, the simple adjustment of the reference definition allowed us to
   transfer the indices with no structural changes to the metrics. This
   approach can facilitate future index adaptations that allow
   practitioners to include waterbody types for which there is no current
   index into routine biomonitoring programs.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{285-294}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of gross primary production (GPP) of ecosystem is
   needed to evaluate terrestrial carbon cycle at various spatial and
   temporal scales. Eddy covariance (EC) technique provides continuous
   measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and can be used to
   separate GPP from NEE in real time series. However, seasonal and
   inter-annual variation and consequently ecosystem carbon budget is still
   very difficult to simulate from climatic and environment. To address
   this limitation, we develop a growing season indicator (GSI) based on
   low temperature and soil water stress to model and predict intra and
   inter-annual dynamic of gross primary productivity (GPP). Validation of
   this new index was conducted using continuous six-year consective EC
   measurement from 2004 to 2009 at a Tibetan alpine meadow. Simulated GPP
   agreed well with the observed GPP in terms of seasonal and inter-annual
   variation. The six-year correlation coefficients on seasonal scale
   between GSI and scalar GPP derived from EC reached more than 0.85 no
   matter in dry years or wet years. In addition, the temporal GPP
   estimation derived from GSI model was quite similar to those from
   observed values by EC measurement. Moreover, accumulated GSI values can
   predict annual variability of net ecosystem production (NEP). Higher
   yearly accumulated GSI corresponded to more annual NEP. When cumulative
   GSI arrived up to 92, the target ecosystem was a carbon sink. This is
   probably a threshold which Tibetan alpine meadow changes from carbon
   source to carbon sink. It is indicated that the GSI model is a simple,
   alternative approach to estimating GPP and has the potential to simulate
   spatial GPP in a larger scale. However, the performance of GSI model in
   other vegetation types or regions still needs a further verification.}},

   in female eastern gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor)}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Nocturnal light levels vary throughout the course of the lunar cycle,
   being darkest during the new moon and brightest during the full moon.
   Many nocturnal animals change their behavior in response to this natural
   variation in moonlight intensity. Frequently, these behavioral changes
   can be attributed to the way in which moonlight affects the ability of
   predators to spot potential prey. Mate sampling females may expose
   themselves to predators, making mate choice a behavior likely influenced
   by moonlight. Because mate choice is an important cause of sexual
   selection, understanding the causes of variation in mate choice
   decisions can yield a better understanding of the strength and direction
   of sexual selection under natural conditions. We predicted that female
   eastern gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor) would prefer longer calls
   (i.e., more attractive males) and/or be choosier, under darker
   conditions, because cover of darkness may aid in predator evasion.
   However, light treatment did not affect how females responded to
   variation in call duration, nor did it affect female choosiness or
   aspects of their approach behavior. This suggests that in gray
   treefrogs, variation in light levels associated with the changing phases
   of the moon does not alter the sexual selection regime on male call
   traits.
   Significance statement
   Looking for the perfect mate can be very dangerous, especially when
   environmental conditions make it more likely to be spotted by potential
   predators. Changes in mate choice behavior associated with predator
   exposure is quite common in nature, yet have rarely been examined in
   connection with the drastic variation in nocturnal illumination
   associated with the changing phases of the moon. We investigated whether
   females of a nocturnal treefrog change their behavior depending on
   whether they look for mates under simulated new moon or full moon
   conditions. We found that females preferred longer calls under both
   conditions, and that they also did not move more stealthily during
   bright compared to dark conditions. Our results suggest that males with
   long calls always have a mating advantage, and that sexual selection by
   female choice is uniformly strong across the lunar cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Economic development and environmental conservation are often seen as
   opposing forces in the arena of government policy-making. With more than
   7 million people and a rich diversity of marine species and habitats,
   Hong Kong is an excellent case study to explore this dynamic. Despite
   anthropogenic impacts, Hong Kong still hosts more than 90 species of
   stony corals within a marine area of 1650 km 2. This is remarkable in
   light of the global plight of coral reefs, which have been reduced by
   similar to 80\% worldwide in recent decades. The Hong Kong Special
   Administrative Region has not been immune to this negative trend with an
   unfortunate track of marine environmental disasters and, as such, can be
   viewed a harbinger for the future trajectory of coral reefs worldwide.
   Yet, the story is not entirely negative. Hong Kong possesses key assets,
   including capable government environmental agencies and competitive
   research led by local universities, which can bring novel and promising
   approaches for coral biodiversity conservation in an urbanized context.
   To coordinate and assist conservation efforts in Hong Kong, we here
   identify and prioritize major management efforts and identify knowledge
   gaps for coral conservation based on updated coral biodiversity
   distribution and a current literature review. Specifically, we propose
   five priorities for the most positive impact on conservation efforts:
   (1) reconstruct environmental baselines and establish long-term
   monitoring of local coral communities, (2) enhance the management and
   protection of local coral habitats, (3) improve water quality, (4) gain
   an understanding of the genetic connectivity among local and distant
   coral communities, and finally, (5) establish an active restoration
   program for local coral species/communities. In order to build
   progressive and integrative management strategies for coral biodiversity
   conservation in Hong Kong, we suggest specific ways in which these
   priorities be addressed and encourage a fresh dialogue between the
   government, the public and academia.}},

Abstract = {{The use of models to generate future scenarios is an important tool for
   restoration planning. We used a scenario modeling approach to examine
   water quality implications of five options for Everglades hydrologic
   restoration. In oligotrophic Everglades wetlands, phosphorus (P) inputs
   exceeding 10 mu g/L cause P accumulation in soils and a shift to cattail
   marsh. Everglades restoration seeks to improve wetland hydrology while
   ensuring that delivered water contains no more than 10 mu g P/L
   (long-term average). Outputs from a landscape-scale ecological model,
   the Everglades Landscape Model (ELM), showed that P concentrations in
   new water inputs will be controlled by P uptake by constructed treatment
   wetlands and by the movement of legacy P. Benthic periphyton responds
   quickly to changes in P, initiating a eutrophication response cascade,
   so we used ELM output to drive periphyton response models that predicted
   abundance, quality, and composition. All five restoration scenarios had
   similar effects on these three attributes in Everglades National Park,
   but variable responses across the other wetland units depended on water
   delivery and legacy P mobilization. Periphyton biomass was considerably
   reduced in scenarios that maximized freshwater delivery, but predicted
   values for periphyton total P were below the legal P concentration
   maximum in most of the Everglades. Benthic algal edibility increased
   more than 4-fold, with the greatest increases in the deeper water areas.
   To meet water quality standards for the five restoration scenarios, we
   estimated that Everglades restoration should include an additional
   105-156 km(2) of treatment marshes upstream of surface water inflows to
   the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsHow do landscape changes along edges of protected areas affect
   forest interiors and stand development? What are the locations, spatial
   extents and magnitudes of these effects?
   LocationThe 8500-ha Sylvania Wilderness Area, Michigan's Upper
   Peninsula, USA.
   MethodsWe conducted vegetation surveys in 202 plots in ten transects
   crossing the Sylvania Wilderness border in 2013 and 2014. We recorded
   characteristics of forest structure, trees, shrubs, saplings, seedlings
   and herbaceous species. We constructed GLMM to estimate the location,
   spatial extent and magnitude of change of edge effects on Sylvania with
   a range of possible edge effect locations and widths of effect. We
   selected best-fit models that minimized the AIC and applied likelihood
   ratio tests to assess the statistical significance of each edge effect.
   ResultsOverall, evidence of edge effects occurred up to 625m into the
   Sylvania Wilderness, with most significant changes occurring within 400m
   of the wilderness border. Wide zones of change occurred across the
   wilderness border, while zones of change farther from the edge tended to
   be narrower, suggesting that distinct environments are established
   beyond the transitional habitats surrounding the border region.
   Canopy-level and understorey-level variables exhibited the largest
   magnitudes and steepest gradients of change, indicating these
   communities are strongly influenced by edge effects in this forest
   system. Canopy-level heterogeneity also increased approaching the
   internal core area of Sylvania.
   ConclusionsIn this case study, we applied a linear change point model
   and found a minimum buffer zone of 400m to mitigate edge effects in an
   old-growth temperate mixed forest. Regionally, land managers could
   implement this buffer to existing edges of protected areas or negotiate
   this buffer zone in land acquisitions. A more stringent buffer zone of
   625m internal and 250m external to old-growth forests would be ideal.
   This application of change point analysis provides a simple, efficient
   method to establish effective buffer zones and to identify functional
   groups or ecosystem attributes for which edge effects are of greatest
   conservation concern. We recommend modifying our open-source change
   point package to estimate local edge effects that take into account
   regional characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-predator responses in animals are dynamic and depend on multiple
   factors. However, most of our understanding about animal escape
   responses comes from studies which examine only a small set of factors
   at a time and are done over a short period of animal life spans. This
   limits our understanding of the dynamic nature of animal escape
   behaviour and the relative importance of individual factors in
   determining their escape behaviour. We used a repeated-measures study
   design to assess the anti-predator response of a wild population of a
   sexually dimorphic tropical lizard, Psammophilus dorsalis. We followed
   marked individuals throughout their breeding lifespan, repeatedly
   assayed their escape response and measured representative intrinsic and
   extrinsic factors that could modulate their escape response. Our
   findings suggest that intrinsic factors, such as sex and body size,
   influenced escape response relatively more than extrinsic factors did,
   such as distance to refuge and perch height. Although individual
   variables influenced escape behaviour, in a direction mostly consistent
   with predictions from optimal escape theory, the interaction between
   factors led to novel insights into how animals dynamically evaluate
   multiple and changing costs throughout their lifetime to evade
   predation.
   Significance statement
   Fleeing from a potential predator is crucial to animals and depends on
   different factors, as there are various costs to escaping. Although
   several studies in the past have evaluated the role of various factors
   in determining escape response, the relative importance of factors and
   how it changes across the lifetime of individuals are not clear. By
   assessing individuals repeatedly over a substantial part of their
   lifespan, we could gain insight into how escape response changes as
   associated factors, intrinsic or extrinsic, change for an individual
   over time. This approach provided us a more robust and accurate
   representation of the dynamic nature of escape decisions. We also
   demonstrate that when multiple factors are considered simultaneously,
   their relative importance in determining timing of escape can
   considerably differ from theoretical predictions.}},

Abstract = {{The circumpolar expansion of woody deciduous shrubs in arctic tundra
   alters key ecosystem properties including carbon balance and hydrology.
   However, landscapescale patterns and drivers of shrub expansion remain
   poorly understood, inhibiting accurate incorporation of shrub effects
   into climate models. Here, we use dendroecology to elucidate the role of
   soil moisture in modifying the relationship between climate and growth
   for a dominant deciduous shrub, Salix pulchra, on the North Slope of
   Alaska, USA. We improve upon previous modeling approaches by using
   ecological theory to guide model selection for the relationship between
   climate and shrub growth. Finally, we present novel dendroecology-based
   estimates of shrub biomass change under a future climate regime, made
   possible by recently developed shrub allometry models. We find that S.
   pulchra growth has responded positively to mean June temperature over
   the past 2.5 decades at both a dry upland tundra site and an adjacent
   mesic riparian site. For the upland site, including a negative
   second-order term in the climate-growth model significantly improved
   explanatory power, matching theoretical predictions of diminishing
   growth returns to increasing temperature. A first-order linear model fit
   best at the riparian site, indicating consistent growth increases in
   response to sustained warming, possibly due to lack of
   temperature-induced moisture limitation in mesic habitats. These
   contrasting results indicate that S. pulchra in mesic habitats may
   respond positively to a wider range of temperature increase than S.
   pulchra in dry habitats. Lastly, we estimate that a 2 degrees C increase
   in current mean June temperature will yield a 19\% increase in
   aboveground S. pulchra biomass at the upland site and a 36\% increase at
   the riparian site. Our method of biomass estimation provides an
   important link toward incorporating dendroecology data into coupled
   vegetation and climate models.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is widely accepted as a conservation tool because fire
   is essential to the maintenance of native biodiversity in many
   terrestrial communities. Approaches to this land-management technique
   vary greatly among continents, and sharing knowledge internationally can
   inform application of prescribed fire worldwide. In North America,
   decisions about how and when to apply prescribed fire are typically
   based on the historical-fire-regime concept (HFRC), which holds that
   replicating the pattern of fires ignited by lightning or preindustrial
   humans best promotes native species in fire-prone regions. The HFRC
   rests on 3 assumptions: it is possible to infer historical fire regimes
   accurately; fire-suppressed communities are ecologically degraded; and
   reinstating historical fire regimes is the best course of action despite
   the global shift toward novel abiotic and biotic conditions. We examined
   the underpinnings of these assumptions by conducting a literature review
   on the use of historical fire regimes to inform the application of
   prescribed fire. We found that the practice of inferring historical fire
   regimes for entire regions or ecosystems often entails substantial
   uncertainty and can yield equivocal results; ecological outcomes of fire
   suppression are complex and may not equate to degradation, depending on
   the ecosystem and context; and habitat fragmentation, invasive species,
   and other modern factors can interact with fire to produce novel and in
   some cases negative ecological outcomes. It is therefore unlikely that
   all 3 assumptions will be fully upheld for any landscape in which
   prescribed fire is being applied. Although the HFRC is a valuable
   starting point, it should not be viewed as the sole basis for developing
   prescribed fire programs. Rather, fire prescriptions should also account
   for other specific, measurable ecological parameters on a case-by-case
   basis. To best achieve conservation goals, researchers should seek to
   understand contemporary fire-biota interactions across trophic levels,
   functional groups, spatial and temporal scales, and management contexts.}},

   Effects of large-scale river diversions on fish and fisheries}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{360}},

Abstract = {{A coupled ecosystem modeling approach was used to evaluate how select
   combinations of large-scale river diversions in the lower Mississippi
   River Deltaic Plain may affect the distribution, biomass, and landings
   of fish and shellfish over decades relative to a future without action.
   These river diversions are controlled openings in the riverbank of the
   Mississippi River designed to reintroduce sediment, water, and nutrients
   into hydrologically isolated coastal wetlands in order to mitigate
   wetland loss. We developed a spatial ecosystem model using Ecopath with
   Ecosim (EwE) software, and prepared it to receive output from a Delft3D
   hydrodynamic model coupled to primary production models. The Delft3D
   model provided environmental drivers including salinity, temperature,
   Chl a, total suspended solids, and change in wetland cover as a result
   of simulated river diversions over decadal model runs. Driver output was
   averaged either daily, monthly, or annually depending on the parameter.
   A novel oyster-specific subroutine is introduced in this paper to
   incorporate information at daily intervals in Ecospace, while Ecospace
   runs on a monthly time step. The ecosystem model simulates biomass and
   distribution of fish and shellfish species, and landings of targeted
   fisheries species, as a result of environmental changes projected for a
   preliminary set of management scenarios designed to evaluate and screen
   select combinations of river diversions. Abundant local field samples
   and landings data allowed for model calibration and validation. The
   results of simulations indicate that inflow of Mississippi River water
   in estuaries may cause local shifts in species assemblages. These
   changes were in some cases direct effects of decreased salinity, such as
   locally reduced Spotted Seatrout biomass. Changes in some other species
   in the affected areas resulted from indirect effects; for example,
   reduced Chl a (as a result of increased TSS) resulted in near-field
   reductions of Gulf Menhaden. The simulations also showed that local
   biomass reductions were mostly the result of redistribution, since the
   scenario with the proposed diversions open had minimal impact on the
   total biomass or landings of species simulated in the Mississippi River
   Delta as compared to a future without action. The model and its output
   were used as a decision support tool to help evaluate and compare
   alternative management actions. The results of this study played a role
   in the decision by the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to
   prioritize moving forward to conduct more detailed analyses through
   engineering and design of the two middle diversions but not the two
   lower diversions that were tested in this study. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{In this study the GAG model, a process-based ammonia (NH3) emission
   model for urine patches, was extended and applied for the field scale.
   The new model (GAG\_field) was tested over two modelling periods, for
   which micrometeorological NH3 flux data were available. Acknowledging
   uncertainties in the measurements, the model was able to simulate the
   main features of the observed fluxes. The temporal evolution of the
   simulated NH3 exchange flux was found to be dominated by NH3 emission
   from the urine patches, offset by simultaneous NH3 deposition to areas
   of the field not affected by urine. The simulations show how NH3 fluxes
   over a grazed field in a given day can be affected by urine patches
   deposited several days earlier, linked to the interaction of
   volatilization processes with soil pH dynamics. Sensitivity analysis
   showed that GAG\_field was more sensitive to soil buffering capacity
   (beta), field capacity (theta(fc)) and permanent wilting point
   (theta(pwp)) than the patch-scale model. The reason for these different
   sensitivities is dual. Firstly, the difference originates from the
   different scales. Secondly, the difference can be explained by the
   different initial soil pH and physical properties, which determine the
   maximum volume of urine that can be stored in the NH3 source layer. It
   was found that in the case of urine patches with a higher initial soil
   pH and higher initial soil water content, the sensitivity of NH3
   exchange to beta was stronger. Also, in the case of a higher initial
   soil water content, NH3 exchange was more sensitive to the changes in
   theta(fc) and theta(pwp). The sensitivity analysis showed that the
   nitrogen content of urine (c(N)) is associated with high uncertainty in
   the simulated fluxes. However, model experiments based on c(N) values
   randomized from an estimated statistical distribution indicated that
   this uncertainty is considerably smaller in practice.
   Finally, GAG\_field was tested with a constant soil pH of 7.5. The
   variation of NH3 fluxes simulated in this way showed a good agreement
   with those from the simulations with the original approach, accounting
   for a dynamically changing soil pH. These results suggest a way for
   model simplification when GAG\_field is applied later at regional scale.}},

Abstract = {{Species invasions represent a significant dimension of global change yet
   the dynamics of invasions remain poorly understood and are considered
   rather unpredictable. We explored interannual dynamics of the invasion
   process in the Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) and tested
   whether the advance of the invasion front of the species in North
   America relates to centrality (versus peripherality) within its
   estimated fundamental ecological niche. We used ecological niche
   modelling approaches to estimate the dimensions of the fundamental
   ecological niche on the Old World distribution of the species, and then
   transferred that model to the New World as measures of centrality versus
   peripherality within the niche for the species. Although our hypothesis
   was that the invasion front would advance faster over more favourable
   (i.e. more central) conditions, the reverse was the case: the invasion
   expanded faster in areas presenting less favourable (i.e. more
   peripheral) conditions for the species as it advanced across North
   America. This result offers a first view of a predictive approach to the
   dynamics of species' invasions, and thereby has relevant implications
   for the management of invasive species, as such a predictive
   understanding would allow better anticipation of coming steps and
   advances in the progress of invasions, important to designing and

Abstract = {{The present paper describes a process oriented modelling tool that
   integrates physical, biogeochemical, ecological and physiological
   factors governing bivalve populated marine ecosystems. This modelling
   tool is the result of the coupling between an individual-based
   population model for bivalves (based on the Dynamic Energy Budgets
   theory, DEB) and a hydrodynamic/biogeochemical model (MOHID Water
   Modelling System). The model was implemented in the Balgzand area
   (Wadden Sea, The Netherlands) in a fine resolution domain to study
   mussel population dynamics and to quantify the influence of mussel
   communities on the pelagic system. Model results for a reference
   scenario (2009/2010) are in agreement with observations, and provide a
   consistent quantitative description of local hydrodynamics and
   biogeochemical cycles. The Balgzand acts as a sink of phytoplankton due
   to bivalves' filtration, and a source of ammonia, exporting about 40\%
   more than the input flux. These results suggest significant ammonia
   regeneration. Results show that despite the long and almost continuous
   spawning season, only a few cohorts are able to survive. Early stage
   mortality (top-down), in particular cannibalism and shrimp predation,
   can control the persistence of new cohorts in the first month although
   starvation (bottom-up) represents the main cause of biomass loss in an
   overall. The tendency is that new mussel beds are formed in areas
   adjacent to already existing mussel beds and channel edges. Bivalves'
   activity intensifies the seasonal patterns of food and nutrients in
   areas close to the mussel beds, though not changing their overall
   spatial distribution. This study not only confirms but also quantifies
   mussels' potential to influence ecosystem functioning due to their role
   in nutrient cycling. As the first integrated modelling study that focus
   on the mussels' beds in the Balgzand, the main difficulties on the model
   design, setup and results analysis were overcome. The model can now be
   used further, tested and improved in the same or other systems in order
   to serve as an effective and reliable scientific and management tool.

Abstract = {{We develop a new perspective on the uncertainties affecting the
   predictions of coastal species distributions using patterns of genetic
   diversity to assess the congruence of hindcasted distribution models. We
   model the niche of the subtidal seagrass Cymodocea nodosa, for which
   previous phylogeographic findings are used to contrast hypotheses for
   the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Mediterranean and adjacent
   Atlantic coastal regions. We focus on amelioration of sampling bias, and
   explore the influence of other sources of uncertainty such as the number
   of variables, Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs), and thresholds
   used. To do that, we test geographical and environmental filtering of
   presences, and a species-specific weighted filter related to political
   boundaries for background data. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that
   reducing sampling bias by means of geographical, environmental or
   background filtering would enhance predictive power and reliability of
   the models, none of these approaches consistently improved performance.
   These counter-intuitive results might be explained by the higher
   relative occurrence area (ROA) inherent to linear coastal study areas in
   relation to terrestrial regions, which may cause worse predictions and,
   thus, higher variability among models. We found that the Ocean General
   Circulation Models (OGCMs), the threshold and, to a smaller extent, the
   number of variables used, conditioned greatly the variability of the
   predictions in both accuracy and geographic range. Despite these
   uncertainties, all models achieved the goal of identifying long-term
   persistence regions (glacial refugia) where the highest genetic
   diversity for Cymodocea nodosa is found nowadays. However, only the CCSM
   corroborated the hypothesis, raised in previous studies, of a vicariant

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Resilience is a complex, multidimensional property of ecosystems that
   describes how ecosystems respond to disturbance and likely results from
   the interactions of species and their environments across temporal and
   spatial scales. Due to the complexity in how ecosystems function and
   respond to disturbance, measuring resilience is a challenge. Gradient
   analysis provides a familiar, yet somewhat neglected framework for
   understanding and characterizing resilience. With simulations
   parameterized on existing biomonitoring data, we used distance-based
   measures in ordination space to characterize community-level resilience,
   here defined as a function of resistance and recovery. Our simulations
   and analyses involved five steps: (1) We generated regional species
   pools by simulating species distributions across environmental
   gradients; (2) we sampled from these regional species pools to emulate
   temporal changes in reference (i.e., minimally disturbed) and impacted
   communities responding to disturbance; (3) we performed ordinations on
   observations from both impacted and reference communities to summarize
   multivariate data; (4) we calculated distance-based measures for
   individual community trajectories in the ordinations to quantify their
   relative resistance and resilience; and (5) we compared these
   distance-based metrics between reference and impacted communities. We
   conclude with an empirical example demonstrating the lack of resistance
   of the Harp Lake (Ontario, Canada) zooplankton community to invasion
   relative to the changes observed among minimally disturbed reference
   communities. Overall, distance measures on ordinations provide a simple
   and effective visual framework to quantify the relative resistance and
   resilience of communities to disturbance, and our simulation approach
   provides a novel technique to develop and evaluate quantitative metrics
   related to ecosystem or community-level processes.}},

   effects between precipitation and the basal resource for some species
   and a lack of correlation between resource and oribatid mite stable
   isotope values for others. We discuss the pertinence of using
   conventional data calibration as it appears to mask relevant trends
   regarding the trophic ecology of oribatid mite species, and suggest
   using statistical control (a covariate approach) instead. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Marine mollusc shells enclose a wealth of information on coastal
   organisms and their environment. Their life history traits as well as
   (palaeo-) environmental conditions, including temperature, food
   availability, salinity and pollution, can be traced through the analysis
   of their shell (micro-) structure and biogeochemical composition. Adding
   to this list, the DNA entrapped in shell carbonate biominerals
   potentially offers a novel and complementary proxy both for
   reconstructing palaeoenvironments and tracking mollusc evolutionary
   trajectories. Here, we assess this potential by applying DNA extraction,
   high-throughput shotgun DNA sequencing and metagenomic analyses to
   marine mollusc shells spanning the last similar to 7,000 years. We
   report successful DNA extraction from shells, including a variety of
   ancient specimens, and find that DNA recovery is highly dependent on
   their biomineral structure, carbonate layer preservation and disease
   state. We demonstrate positive taxonomic identification of mollusc
   species using a combination of mitochondrial DNA genomes, barcodes,
   genome-scale data and metagenomic approaches. We also find shell
   biominerals to contain a diversity of microbial DNA from the marine
   environment. Finally, we reconstruct genomic sequences of organisms
   closely related to the Vibrio tapetis bacteria from Manila clam shells
   previously diagnosed with Brown Ring Disease. Our results reveal marine
   mollusc shells as novel genetic archives of the past, which opens new
   perspectives in ancient DNA research, with the potential to reconstruct
   the evolutionary history of molluscs, microbial communities and
   pathogens in the face of environmental changes. Other future
   applications include conservation of endangered mollusc species and
   aquaculture management.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Animals are well known for trading off food and safety, and
   we have previously shown for Allenby's gerbil (Gerbillus andersoni
   allenbyi) that the intensity of this trade-off changes with energetic
   state. Furthermore, we have shown that concentrations of corticosteroid
   metabolites in desert rodents' faeces change in response to changing
   levels of food availability, competitor density, and moonlight. This
   suggests that stress hormones play an important role in mediating the
   trade-off of food and safety and in managing foraging.
   Hypotheses: Higher concentrations of the exogenous stress hormone
   cortisol will increase gerbils' marginal valuation of energy (MVE) and
   their vigilance. In general, cortisol will mediate responses to slowly
   changing factors associated with food and safety, but not to rapidly
   changing ones.
   Methods: In order to test these hypotheses, we manipulated cortisol
   concentrations in a set of gerbils by injecting each subcutaneously with
   21-day slow-release 0.01 mg cortisol pellets and compared their foraging
   behaviour with that of a control group. The experiment was conducted in
   a large outdoor vivarium where we could simulate features of the
   gerbils' desert environment, manipulate the presence of a predatory owl
   (i.e. a rapidly changing factor), and quantify patch use over the course
   of a lunar cycle from new moon to full moon (i.e. a slowly changing
   factor). Foraging behaviour was quantified by giving-up densities (GUDs;
   the amount of food left in a resource patch after foraging), time
   allocated to foraging, and harvest rate curves in artificial foraging
   patches (seed trays).
   Results: Giving-up densities were affected by the interaction of
   cortisol treatment and moon phase, but not the interaction of cortisol
   treatment and owl presence. Gerbils implanted with cortisol foraged
   longer, but harvested food more slowly (suggesting greater vigilance and
   apprehension), than placebo-treated gerbils. This reaffirms that
   glucocorticoids affect energy acquisition, and provides a physiological
   context to explain how foragers manage risk and the trade-off between
   food and safety.}},

Journal = {{ECOHYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Plant species distribution is dominated by abundance and fluctuations of
   the available resources. Although diversity patterns along rainfall,
   latitudinal, and altitudinal gradients have been thoroughly examined,
   the role of hydrological processes in sustaining the resource
   availability critical to species richness is still poorly understood.
   Adopting soil moisture as a main limiting factor driving plant diversity
   in the tropics besides elevation, we propose a minimalist species
   richness model based on stochastic soil water balance and information
   theory. This work provides a novel approach to plant diversity modeling
   through a quantitative representation of the soil water balance,
   demonstrating the role of different modes of soil moisture temporal
   variability in the creation of ecohydrological niches. Using a single
   calibration parameter, the model captures the observed biodiversity
   patterns in tropical South America, effectively synthesizing the impacts
   of energy and water balances on species richness. We show that soil
   water abundance and variability are the strongest predictors of plant
   diversity in tropical SouthAmerica besides elevation, with latitude and
   seasonal variation in potential evapotranspiration having a secondary
   effect. Excluding soilmoisture abundance, seasonal and intraseasonal
   variability reducesmodel accuracy by 50, 48, and 64\%. The importance of
   atmospheric humidity as an additional plant water resource creating
   niches for canopy species is also highlighted. Our results suggest that

Abstract = {{The 2012 revision of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan
   (NAWMP) explicitly recognized the need to increase recruitment and
   retention of waterfowl hunters, birdwatchers, and other conservationists
   to maintain support for wetland conservation. The incorporation of human
   dimensions objectives within the NAWMP has compelled waterfowl and
   wetland managers to consider whether and to what extent landscape
   characteristics such as public land access; the type, amount, and
   location of wetlands; and site infrastructure will increase support for
   wetland conservation among user groups. Further, it has forced the
   waterfowl community to consider the possible trade-offs between managing
   land to achieve biological versus social objectives. We used publicly
   available, long-term data sets to illustrate a method of incorporating
   human dimensions into waterfowl habitat planning and management. We used
   United States Fish and Wildlife Service waterfowl harvest survey data,
   United States Geological Survey band encounter data, and Cornell Lab of
   Ornithology eBird data to summarize travel characteristics of wetland
   bird enthusiasts (i.e., waterfowl hunters and birdwatchers) in the
   Atlantic Flyway. Greater than 90\% of all trips by wetland bird
   enthusiasts occurred within their state of residence. We used data from
   New York, USA, to demonstrate how to construct discrete choice
   recreation demand models to identify factors that influence site
   selection and participation. We demonstrate how model outputs, such as
   the expected change in the number and geographic distribution of
   recreational trips (i.e., hunting or birdwatching), can be used as an
   objective metric to evaluate the benefits of alternative habitat
   acquisition and restoration projects relative to the human dimensions
   objective of the NAWMP. These data and methods show promise for
   incorporating human dimensions objectives into habitat delivery and
   understanding potential trade-offs relative to biological objectives.

Abstract = {{1. Monitoring biodiversity over large spatial and temporal scales is
   crucial for assessing the impact of global changes and environmental
   mitigation measures. However, large-scale monitoring of invertebrates
   remains poorly developed despite the importance of these organisms in
   ecosystem functioning. Exciting possibilities applicable to professional
   and citizen science are offered by new recording techniques and methods
   of semi-automated species recognition based on sound detection.
   2. Static broad-spectrum detectors deployed to record throughout whole
   nights have been recommended for standardised acoustic monitoring of
   bats, but they have the potential to also collect acoustic data for
   other species groups. Large-scale deployment of such systems is only
   viable when combined with robust automated species identification
   algorithms. Here we examine the potential of such a system for
   detecting, identifying and monitoring bush-crickets (Orthoptera of the
   family Tettigoniidae). We use incidental sound recordings generated by
   an extensive citizen science bat survey and recordings from intensive
   site surveys to test a semi-automated step-wise method with a classifier
   for assigning species identities. We assess species' diel activity
   patterns to make recommendations for survey timing and interpretation of
   existing nocturnal data sets and consider the feasibility of determining
   site occupancy.
   3. Of six species of bush-crickets, the species classifier achieved over
   85\% accuracy for three, speckled bush-cricket, dark bush-cricket and
   Roesel's bush-cricket. It should be possible to automatically scan
   recordings for these species with minimal manual validation. Further
   refinement of the classifier is required for the three remaining
   species, in particular for the acoustically similar short-winged
   conehead and long-winged conehead. Diel activity patterns are species
   specific and it may be necessary to adjust the hours over which the
   detectors record to increase detection of key species, but this must be
   weighed against the costs in terms of increased memory and battery use
   and equipment security during daytime.
   4. We conclude that with logistical support and centralised
   semi-automated species identification it is now possible for the public
   to contribute to large-scale acoustic monitoring of Orthoptera while
   recording bats. Further innovation of sound classifier algorithms is
   needed and would be aided by improved reference sound libraries from
   multiple locations spanning species' ranges.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{1. Individual behaviour, that is, the reaction of an organism to
   internal state, conspecifics and individuals of other species as well as
   the environment, is a crucial building block of their ecology. Modern
   tracking techniques produce high-frequency observations of spatial
   positions of animals and accompanying speed and tortuosity measurements.
   However, inferring behavioural modes from movement trajectories remains
   a challenge.
   2. Changes in behavioural modes occur at different temporal and spatial
   scales and may take two forms: abrupt, representing distinct change
   points; or continuous, representing smooth transitions between movement
   modes. The multi-scale nature of these behavioural changes necessitates
   development of methods that can pinpoint behavioural states across
   spatial and temporal scales.
   3. We propose a novel segmentation method based on the discrete wavelet
   transform (DWT), where the movement signal is decomposed into
   low-frequency approximation and high-frequency detail sub-bands to
   screen for behavioural changes at multiple scales. Approximation
   sub-bands characterizes broad changes by taking the continuous
   variations between behavioural modes into account, whereas detail
   sub-bands are employed to detect abrupt, finer scale change points.
   4. We tested the ability of our method to identify behavioural modes in
   simulated trajectories by comparing it to three state-of-the-art methods
   from the literature. We further validated the method using an annotated
   dataset of turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) relating extracted segments
   to the expert knowledge of migratory vs. non-migratory patterns. Our
   results show that the proposed DWT segmentation is more versatile than
   other segmentation methods, as it can be applied to different movement
   parameters, performs better or equally well on the simulated data, and
   correctly identifies behavioural modes identified by the experts. It is
   hence a valuable addition to the toolbox of land managers and
   conservation practitioners to understand the behavioural patterns
   expressed by animals in natural and human-dominated landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Biological invasions are a substantial threat to Antarctic
   biodiversity and a priority conservation policy focus for Antarctic
   Treaty Parties and the sovereign states of surrounding islands. Key to
   their strategies is prevention, including assessment of establishment
   risk for alien species. Despite establishment of some of the worst
   globally invasive species across the Antarctic region, assessments of
   establishment potential of these species are non-existent. Here, we
   address this deficit and determine whether these invasive species
   constitute a significant conservation threat to the broader Antarctic
   region both now and in response to future regional climate change.
   Location: Antarctica and the Southern Ocean islands (45 degrees-90
   degrees S).
   Methods: We used ensemble species distribution models to assess the
   current and future climate suitability of the Antarctic region for 69 of
   the worst globally invasive species and 24 insect and plant species that
   have already established somewhere in the region.
   Results: The Antarctic continent is unsuitable for all of the worst
   globally invasive species under current conditions, but areas of the
   Antarctic Peninsula are predicted to become climatically suitable for up
   to six globally invasive species within the next century. By contrast,
   all Southern Ocean islands are presently climatically suitable for
   additional non-native species, with the threat increasing in the future.
   Main conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that climate, which is often
   cited as a key barrier to alien species establishment, may afford some
   protection to continental Antarctica, but that this protection is not
   currently extended to the Southern Ocean islands. Furthermore, existing
   climatic barriers to alien species establishment will weaken as warming
   continues across the region. This not only illustrates the value of
   applying distribution modelling methods to this largely ice-covered
   region, but demonstrates how these methods can be used to inform
   targeted surveillance of introduction pathways and sites that have the
   highest risk of establishment of invasive alien species.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence rate of new plant diseases is increasing due to novel
   introductions, climate change, and changes in vector populations, posing
   risks to agricultural sustainability. Assessing and managing future
   disease risks depends on understanding the causes of contemporary and
   historical emergence events. Since the mid-1990s, potato growers in the
   western United States, Mexico, and Central America have experienced
   severe yield loss from Zebra Chip disease and have responded by
   increasing insecticide use to suppress populations of the insect vector,
   the potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Hemiptera: Triozidae).
   Despite the severe nature of Zebra Chip outbreaks, the causes of
   emergence remain unknown. We tested the hypotheses that (1) B.
   cockerelli occupancy has increased over the last century in California
   and (2) such increases are related to climate change, specifically
   warmer winters. We compiled a data set of 87,000 museum specimen
   occurrence records across the order Hemiptera collected between 1900 and
   2014. We then analyzed changes in B. cockerelli distribution using a
   hierarchical occupancy model using changes in background species lists
   to correct for collecting effort. We found evidence that B. cockerelli
   occupancy has increased over the last century. However, these changes
   appear to be unrelated to climate changes, at least at the scale of our
   analysis. To the extent that species occupancy is related to abundance,
   our analysis provides the first quantitative support for the hypothesis
   that B. cockerelli population abundance has increased, but further work
   is needed to link B. cockerelli population dynamics to Zebra Chip
   epidemics. Finally, we demonstrate how this historical macro-ecological
   approach provides a general framework for comparative risk assessment of
   future pest and insect vector outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{1. Logging is a major driver of tropical forest degradation, with severe
   impacts on plant richness and composition. Rarely have these effects
   been considered in terms of their impact on the functional and
   phylogenetic diversity of understorey plant communities, despite the
   direct relevance to community reassembly trajectories. Here, we test the
   effects of logging on functional traits and evolutionary relatedness,
   over and above effects that can be explained by changes in species
   richness alone. We hypothesised that strong environmental filtering will
   result in more clustered (under-dispersed) functional and phylogenetic
   structures within communities as logging intensity increases.
   2. We surveyed understorey plant communities at 180 locations across a
   logging intensity gradient from primary to repeatedly logged tropical
   lowland rain forest in Sabah, Malaysia. For the 691 recorded plant taxa,
   we generated a phylogeny to assess plot-level phylogenetic relatedness.
   We quantified 10 plant traits known to respond to disturbance and affect
   ecosystem functioning, and tested the influence of logging on functional
   and phylogenetic structure.
   3. We found no significant effect of forest canopy loss or road
   configuration on species richness. By contrast, both functional
   dispersion and phylogenetic dispersion (net relatedness index) showed
   strong gradients from clustered towards more randomly assembled
   communities at higher logging intensity, independent of variation in
   species richness. Moreover, there was a significant nonlinear shift in
   the trait dispersion relationship above a logging intensity threshold of
   c. 65\% canopy loss (+/- 17\% CL). All functional traits showed
   significant phylogenetic signals, suggesting broad concordance between
   functional and phylogenetic dispersion, at least below the logging
   intensity threshold.
   4. Synthesis. We found a strong logging signal in the functional and
   phylogenetic structure of understorey plant communities, over and above
   species richness, but this effect was opposite to that predicted.
   Logging increased, rather than decreased, functional and phylogenetic
   dispersion in understorey plant communities. This effect was
   particularly pronounced for functional response traits, which directly
   link disturbance with plant community reassembly. Our study provides
   novel insights into the way logging affects understorey plant
   communities in tropical rain forest and highlights the importance of
   trait-based approaches to improve our understanding of the broad range
   of logging-associated impacts.}},

Abstract = {{A central goal in limnology is measurement of physical, biogeochemical,
   and biological process rates. We can measure process rates from the
   temporal and spatial patterns they create in a measured variable, and we
   use 3 approaches for making those measurements: the fixed-site approach
   for detecting temporal pattern at a location, the snapshot approach for
   detecting spatial pattern at an instant in time, and the flow path
   approach for detecting temporal pattern as it changes through space. To
   compare and contrast these approaches, we present patterns in
   temperature collected simultaneously based on all 3 approaches.
   Translating these patterns into process rates requires different
   assumptions for each approach, and these assumptions lead to uncertainty
   in process rates. We propose that these assumptions and related
   uncertainty can be reduced by making simultaneous measurements based on
   all 3 approaches. Each approach fills gaps in the spatial and temporal
   patterns measured by the others, and these patterns can be combined to
   derive a process rate. We develop a conceptual theory to support this
   strategy for measuring process rate based on 2 criteria: the mixing time
   of a water body and the analytical limitations of the measurement. This
   new strategy for measuring process rates in aquatic environments has the
   potential to increase the resolution of rate measurements, reduce their
   uncertainty, and enhance limnologists' ability to resolve process rates
   from an increasing flow of environmental data.}},

Title = {{Reorganization of interaction networks modulates the persistence of

Abstract = {{Ecological interaction networks constantly reorganize as interspecific
   interactions change across successional stages and environmental
   gradients. This reorganization can also be associated with the extent to
   which species change their preference for types of niches available in
   their local sites. Despite the pervasiveness of these interaction
   changes, previous studies have revealed that network reorganizations
   have a minimal or insignificant effect on global descriptors of network
   architecture, such as connectance, modularity and nestedness. However,
   little is known about whether these reorganizations may have an effect
   on community dynamics and composition.
   To answer the question above, we study the multi-year dynamics and
   reorganization of plant-herbivore interaction networks across secondary
   successional stages of a tropical dry forest. We develop new
   quantitative tools based on a structural stability approach to estimate
   the potential impact of network reorganization on species persistence.
   Then, we investigate whether this impact can explain the likelihood of
   persistence of herbivore species in the observed communities.
   We find that resident (early-arriving) herbivore species increase their
   likelihood of persistence across time and successional stages.
   Importantly, we demonstrate that, in late successional stages, the
   reorganization of interactions among resident species has a strong
   inhibitory effect on the likelihood of persistence of colonizing
   (late-arriving) herbivores.
   These findings support earlier predictions suggesting that, in mature
   communities, changes of species interactions can act as
   community-control mechanisms (also known as priority effects).
   Furthermore, our results illustrate that the dynamics and composition of
   ecological communities cannot be fully understood without attention to
   their reorganization processes, despite the invariability of global
   network properties.}},

Title = {{Fire regimes and forest resilience: alternative vegetation states in the

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Context Terrestrial ecosystems, including tropical forests, are
   hypothesized to have tipping points beyond which environmental change
   triggers rapid and radical shifts to novel alternative states.
   Objective We explored the overarching hypothesis that fire-mediated
   alternative stable states exist in the semi-deciduous tropical forest
   zone of Ghana, and that increased fire activity has pushed some forests
   to a new state in which a novel ecosystem with low tree density is
   maintained by fire.
   Methods We combined a 30-year time series of remotely-sensed data with
   field measurements to assess land cover trends, the effects of fire on
   forest vegetation, and the reciprocal effects of vegetation change on
   fire regimes, in four forest reserves. We analyzed precipitation trends
   to determine if shifts in vegetation and fire regime reflected a shift
   to a drier climate.
   Results Two of the reserves experienced forest loss, were impacted by
   frequent fires, and transitioned to a vegetation community dominated by
   shrubs and grasses, which was maintained by fire-vegetation feedbacks.
   The other two reserves experienced less fire, retained higher levels of
   forest cover, and resisted fire encroachment from surrounding
   agricultural areas. Precipitation remained relatively stable, suggesting
   a hysteresis effect in which different vegetation states and fire
   regimes coexist within a similar climate.
   Conclusion There is potential for human land use and fire to create
   novel and persistent non-forest vegetation communities in areas that are
   climatically suitable for tropical forests. These disturbance-mediated
   regime shifts should be taken into account when assessing future
   trajectories of forest landscape change in West Africa.}},

Title = {{Vulnerability of European freshwater catchments to climate change}},

Volume = {{23}},

Pages = {{3567-3580}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is expected to exacerbate the current threats to
   freshwater ecosystems, yet multifaceted studies on the potential impacts
   of climate change on freshwater biodiversity at scales that inform
   management planning are lacking. The aim of this study was to fill this
   void through the development of a novel framework for assessing climate
   change vulnerability tailored to freshwater ecosystems. The three
   dimensions of climate change vulnerability are as follows: (i) exposure
   to climate change, (ii) sensitivity to altered environmental conditions
   and (iii) resilience potential. Our vulnerability framework includes
   1685 freshwater species of plants, fishes, molluscs, odonates,
   amphibians, crayfish and turtles alongside key features within and
   between catchments, such as topography and connectivity. Several
   methodologies were used to combine these dimensions across a variety of
   future climate change models and scenarios. The resulting indices were
   overlaid to assess the vulnerability of European freshwater ecosystems
   at the catchment scale (18 783 catchments). The Balkan Lakes Ohrid and
   Prespa and Mediterranean islands emerge as most vulnerable to climate
   change. For the 2030s, we showed a consensus among the applied methods
   whereby up to 573 lake and river catchments are highly vulnerable to
   climate change. The anthropogenic disruption of hydrological habitat
   connectivity by dams is the major factor reducing climate change
   resilience. A gap analysis demonstrated that the current European
   protected area network covers <25\% of the most vulnerable catchments.
   Practical steps need to be taken to ensure the persistence of freshwater
   biodiversity under climate change. Priority should be placed on
   enhancing stakeholder cooperation at the major basin scale towards
   preventing further degradation of freshwater ecosystems and maintaining
   connectivity among catchments. The catchments identified as most
   vulnerable to climate change provide preliminary targets for development
   of climate change conservation management and mitigation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Novel climates - emerging conditions with no analog in the observational
   record - are an open problem in ecological modeling. Detecting
   extrapolation into novel conditions is a critical step in evaluating
   bioclimatic projections of how species and ecosystems will respond to
   climate change. However, biologically informed novelty detection methods
   remain elusive for many modeling algorithms. To assist with bioclimatic
   model design and evaluation, we present a first-approximation assessment
   of general novelty based on a simple and consistent characterization of
   climate. We build on the seminal global analysis of Williams et al.
   (2007 PNAS, 104, 5738) by assessing of end-of-21st-century novelty for
   North America at high spatial resolution and by refining their
   standardized Euclidean distance into an intuitive Mahalanobian metric
   called sigma dissimilarity. Like this previous study, we found extensive
   novelty in end-of-21st-century projections for the warm southern margin
   of the continent as well as the western Arctic. In addition, we detected
   localized novelty in lower topographic positions at all latitudes: By
   the end of the 21st century, novel climates are projected to emerge at
   low elevations in 80\% and 99\% of ecoregions in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5
   emissions scenarios, respectively. Novel climates are limited to 7\% of
   the continent's area in RCP4.5, but are much more extensive in RCP8.5
   (40\% of area). These three risk factors for novel climates - regional
   susceptibility, topographic position, and the magnitude of projected
   climate change - represent a priori evaluation criteria for the
   credibility of bioclimatic projections. Our findings indicate that novel
   climates can emerge in any landscape. Interpreting climatic novelty in
   the context of nonlinear biological responses to climate is an important
   challenge for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal salt marshes are dynamic, intertidal ecosystems that are
   increasingly being recognised for their contributions to ecosystem
   services, including carbon (C) accumulation and storage. The survival of
   salt marshes and their capacity to store C under rising sea levels,
   however, is partially reliant upon sedimentation rates and influenced by
   a combination of physical and biological factors. In this study, we use
   several complementary methods to assess short-term (days) deposition and
   medium-term (months) accretion dynamics within a single marsh that
   contains three salt marsh vegetation types common throughout
   southeastern (SE) Australia.
   We found that surface accretion varies among vegetation assemblages,
   with medium-term (19 months) bulk accretion rates in the upper marsh
   rush (Juncus) assemblage (1.74 +/- 0.13 mm yr(-1)) consistently in
   excess of estimated local sea-level rise (1.15 mm yr(-1)). Accretion
   rates were lower and less consistent in both the succulent (Sarcocornia,
   0.78 +/- 0.18 mm yr(-1)) and grass (Sporobolus, 0.88 +/- 0.22 mm yr(-1))
   assemblages located lower in the tidal frame. Short-term (6 days)
   experiments showed deposition within Juncus plots to be dominated by
   autochthonous organic inputs with C deposition rates ranging from 1.14
   +/- 0.41 mg C cm(-2) d(-1) (neap tidal period) to 2.37 +/- 0.44 mg C
   cm(-2) d(-1) (spring tidal period), while minerogenic inputs and lower C
   deposition dominated Sarcocornia (0.10 +/- 0.02 to 0.62 +/- 0.08 mg C
   cm(-2) d(-1)) and Sporobolus (0.17 +/- 0.04 to 0.40 +/- 0.07 mg C cm(-2)
   d(-1)) assemblages.
   Elemental (C : N), isotopic (delta C-13), mid-infrared (MIR) and C-13
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses revealed little difference in
   either the source or character of materials being deposited among neap
   versus spring tidal periods. Instead, these analyses point to
   substantial redistribution of materials within the Sarcocornia and
   Sporobolus assemblages, compared to high retention and preservation of
   organic inputs in the Juncus assemblage. By combining medium-term
   accretion quantification with short-term deposition measurements and
   chemical analyses, we have gained novel insights into above-ground
   biophysical processes that may explain previously observed regional
   differences in surface dynamics among key salt marsh vegetation
   assemblages. Our results suggest that Sarcocornia and Sporobolus
   assemblages may be particularly susceptible to changes in sea level,
   though quantification of below-ground processes (e.g. root production,
   compaction) is needed to confirm this.}},

   as epi- and endoliths collected from shallow streams and rocks,
   respectively, in the northwestern part of Svalbard. Thirteen populations
   were identified and characterized by employing morphological and
   molecular (16S rRNA gene sequences) techniques. Our results were
   compared to analogous information (available from the GenBank) and
   related to organisms from similar environments located in the Northern
   and Southern Hemispheres. In general, the morphological and molecular
   characterizations complemented each other, and the identified Arctic
   populations belonged to the following orders: Oscillatoriales (6),
   Nostocales (6), and Chroococcales (1). Twelve of the identified polar
   populations showed high similarity (94-99\% 16S rRNA gene sequence) when

   Phormidium autumnale shared only 88\% similarity with sequences

Abstract = {{Metabolism is the link between ecology and physiology-it dictates the
   flow of energy through individuals and across trophic levels. Much of
   the predictive power of metabolic theories of ecology derives from the
   scaling relationship between organismal size and metabolic rate. There
   is growing evidence that this scaling relationship is not universal, but
   we have little knowledge of how it has evolved over macroevolutionary
   time. Here we develop a novel phylogenetic comparative method to
   investigate how often and in which clades the macroevolutionary dynamics
   of the metabolic scaling have changed. We find strong evidence that the
   metabolic scaling relationship has shifted multiple times across the
   vertebrate phylogeny. However, shifts are rare and otherwise strongly
   constrained. Importantly, both the estimated slope and intercept values
   vary widely across regimes, with slopes that spanned across
   theoretically predicted values such as 2/3 or 3/4. We further tested
   whether traits such as ecto-/endothermy, genome size, and quadratic
   curvature with body mass (i.e., energetic constraints at extreme body
   sizes) could explain the observed pattern of shifts. Though these
   factors help explain some of the variation in scaling parameters, much
   of the remaining variation remains elusive. Our results lay the

Abstract = {{Biodiversity hotspots are increasingly recognized as areas of high
   taxonomic and functional diversity. These hotspots are dynamic and shift
   geographically over time in response to environmental change. To
   identify drivers of the origin, evolution, and persistence of diversity
   hotspots, we investigated the diversity patterns of reef-building corals
   (Scleractinia) in the Central Indo-Pacific, a marine biodiversity
   hotspot for the last 25 Myr. We used the scleractinian fossil record
   (based on literature and a newly acquired fossil collection) to examine
   the taxonomic and functional diversity of corals from the Eocene to
   Pliocene. Our data identify potential drivers of coral diversity through
   time (and space) in the Central Indo-Pacific by constraining the timing
   of taxonomic turnover events and correlating them with known
   environmental changes. Increases in taxonomic diversity, high
   origination rates, and changes in abundance of functional character
   states indicate that the origin of the Central Indo-Pacific hotspot
   occurred during the Oligocene, initially through proliferation of
   pre-existing taxa and then by origination of new taxa. In contrast to
   taxonomic diversity, overall functional diversity of Central
   Indo-Pacific reef-building corals remained constant from the Eocene to
   the Pliocene. Our results identify global sea level as a main driver of
   diversity increase that, together with local tectonics, regulates
   availability of suitable habitats. Moreover, marine biodiversity
   hotspots develop from both the accumulation of taxa from older
   biodiversity hotspots and origination of new taxa. Our study
   demonstrates the utility of a combined literature-based and new

Abstract = {{The hope for creating widespread change in social values has endured
   among conservation professionals since early calls by Aldo Leopold for a
   ``land ethic.{''} However, there has been little serious attention in
   conservation to the fields of investigation that address values, how
   they are formed, and how they change. We introduce a social-ecological
   systems conceptual approach in which values are seen not only as
   motivational goals people hold but also as ideas that are deeply
   embedded in society's material culture, collective behaviors,
   traditions, and institutions. Values define and bind groups,
   organizations, and societies; serve an adaptive role; and are typically
   stable across generations. When abrupt value changes occur, they are in
   response to substantial alterations in the social-ecological context.
   Such changes build on prior value structures and do not result in
   complete replacement. Given this understanding of values, we conclude
   that deliberate efforts to orchestrate value shifts for conservation are
   unlikely to be effective. Instead, there is an urgent need for research
   on values with a multilevel and dynamic view that can inform innovative
   conservation strategies for working within existing value structures.
   New directions facilitated by a systems approach will enhance

Abstract = {{Freshwater aquatic ecosystems are in decline due to intensifying land
   use, salinisation, water abstraction and climate change. Understanding
   compositional patterns in aquatic biota is a useful step towards better
   management of aquatic ecosystems. We used generalised dissimilarity
   modelling (GDM) to predict compositional turnover in riverine
   invertebrate fauna (primarily insects) as a function of environment.
   Conceptual understanding of major drivers of aquatic invertebrate
   species distribution helped decide which predictor variables to source
   and include. Five groups of environmental variableswaterscape, local
   habitat, climate, landscape and disturbancewere derived from either
   spatial layers or insitu (site) measurements. Predictive models and
   variance partitioning tests of variable groups demonstrated the
   importance of representing all conceptual drivers of ecological pattern
   and process. As expected, waterscape variables were independently the
   most important group, followed by local habitat and landscape variables;
   with complex interactions between groups. Climate variables
   independently contributed the least. To determine the information
   content for mapping patterns, we investigated the independent and
   combined contribution of site-measured and spatial predictors. Even
   though predictive models developed using only site-measured variables or
   only spatial variables explained around the same amount of deviance
   (DE), combined they increased explained model DE by 11.2\%.
   Compositional dissimilarities between the 51 surveyed site pairs
   predicted by the model using only spatial variables were highly
   correlated (r(2)=.85) with dissimilarities predicted using site and
   spatial variables. These results support the use of the spatial model
   for conservation decisions. The spatial model was used to evaluate
   representativeness of both the conservation reserve network and
   biological monitoring locations. The location of aquatic monitoring
   sites was uneven, with comprehensive coverage south and coastward, and
   less representative of inland environments. Proportional protection of
   ecological environments (scaled by riverine invertebrate taxa) was found
   to vary between 20\% and 30\%, being higher in southern parts where more
   land has been allocated to reserves and less in northern and inland
   parts. This demonstrated local progress towards achieving the Convention
   on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11 for inland waters. These
   results provide a focus for improving the robustness of information used
   in decisions affecting the conservation of aquatic biodiversity,
   including places to target to fill gaps in the reserve network and
   additional aquatic monitoring locations (supporting Convention on
   Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 19). The GDM-based approach to
   characterising ecological environments, provided a first quantitative
   foundation for comprehensively evaluating the conservation status of
   freshwater ecosystems in south-western Australia. Potential future

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is expected to alter the distribution of tree species
   because of critical environmental tolerances related to growth,
   mortality, reproduction, disturbances, and biotic interactions. How this
   is realized in 21st century remains uncertain, in large part due to
   limitations on plant migration and the impacts of landscape
   fragmentation. Understanding these changes is of particular concern for
   forest management, which requires information at an appropriately fine
   spatial resolution. Here we provide a framework and application for tree
   species vulnerability to climate change in the eastern United States
   that accounts for influential drivers of future distributions. We used
   species distribution models to project changes in habitat suitability at
   800 m for 40 tree species that vary in physiology, range, and
   environmental niche. We then developed layers of adaptive capacity based
   on migration potential, forest fragmentation, and propagule pressure.
   These were combined into metrics of vulnerability, including an overall
   index and spatially explicit categories designed to inform management.
   Despite overall favorable changes in suitability, the majority of
   species and the landscape were considered vulnerable to climate change.
   Vulnerability was significantly exacerbated by projections of pests and
   pathogens for some species. Northern and high-elevation species tended
   to be the most vulnerable. There were, however, some notable areas of
   particular resilience, including most of West Virginia. Our approach
   combines some of the most important considerations for species
   vulnerability in a straightforward framework, and can be used as a tool
   for managers to prioritize species, areas, and actions.}},

   tool that may promote phase-shift reversals in coral reefs}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{150-161}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Phase shifts from coral-to algal-dominated reefs have grave effects on
   reef biodiversity and key ecosystem functions, further influencing
   management approaches that have generated fewer returns than desired.
   Harnessing the ability of corals to `self-anchor' to substrates and of
   tissue fusions between isogeneic fragments, we develop here a novel
   ecological engineering approach based on the 2D Coral Preparative
   (2D-CP) tool. Using this tool we propose to create flat, two dimensional
   coral units that are first grown in a mid-water coral nursery and then
   transplanted to overlay phase-shifted coral reef surfaces as floor
   tiles. Here, we assess the feasibility of the 2D-CP's first stage-growth
   in the nursery. Ten coral colonies from each of the species: Stylophora
   pistillata, Pocillopora damicornis and Cyphastrea spp. were collected
   from localities at the northern Gulf of Eilat (Red Sea, Israel),
   fragmented into nubbins and glued onto flat surfaces (CDs) to create 235
   2D-CP units (32 nubbins/unit). All 2D-CPs were hung in a mid-water coral
   nursery, in both horizontal and vertical positions, and were digitally
   photographed once a month for a year. Images of each 2D-CP were used to
   determine the percentages of live coral tissue coverage on the
   substrates and the nubbins' survival percentage. Results revealed high
   survival rates, with >80\% of the 2D-CPs possessing live coral tissues
   at 12 months post setup (mps). The nubbins of all three species
   displayed an extensive 2D growth on the substrates, and as of 6-7 months
   (species and genotype specific) many of the 2D-CPs were completely
   covered with coral tissue (20\% of all the 2D-CPs showed >100\% coral
   coverage at 12 mps). The coral coverage of S. pistillata and P.
   damicornis 2D-CPs was significantly higher in the vertical placement
   position, 1.5 and 3 times, respectively.
   Overall, these results imply that the 2D-CP units can be successfully
   grown in a coral nursery for the purpose of creating `live tiles' that
   can be placed directly over a denuded reef covered by turf algae, a
   novel ecological engineering tool to be used for coral-algae phase
   shifts reversals. We further anticipate that even in
   completely/partially dead 2D-CP units, newly exposed calcium carbonates
   would be expended as preferable substrates for either coral larval
   recruitment or coralline algae growth, boosting reef rehabilitation. (C)

Abstract = {{A key assumption of stated preference methods is that individuals have
   well-formed preferences that are robust over time. Both the discovered
   and constructed preference perspectives imply this is not necessarily
   the case. There can be a large situational component to expressed
   preferences that add to the uncertainty of sampling error. Most
   non-market valuation studies only collect data from one point in time so
   the degree of temporal variability cannot be tested. Test-retest studies
   that provide data from two points in time generally find significant
   differences in preference structure and willingness-to-pay (WTP). In
   this study we test stability of WTP for beach erosion management using a
   fully ranked discrete choice experiment survey with not one but two
   retests over a six month period. We find that stability does not improve
   with the additional repetition as the preference discovery hypothesis
   implies it might. WTP confidence intervals overlap but the models are
   significantly different at each point in time, even after allowing for
   variation in choice error. Either the survey did not facilitate
   sufficient preference discovery or preferences were reconstructed.
   However, respondents with high scores of self-reported certainty in
   their choices in the first survey had significantly more stable WTP
   estimates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prehistoric human impacts on megafaunal populations have dramatically
   reshaped ecosystems worldwide. However, the effects of human
   exploitation on smaller species, such as anatids (ducks, geese, and
   swans) are less clear. In this study we apply ancient DNA and
   osteological approaches to reassess the history of Australasia's iconic
   black swans (Cygnus atratus) including the palaeo-behaviour of
   prehistoric populations. Our study shows that at the time of human
   colonization, New Zealand housed a genetically, morphologically, and
   potentially ecologically distinct swan lineage (C. sumnerensis, Po (u)
   over bar wa), divergent from modern (Australian) C. atratus.
   Morphological analyses indicate C. sumnerensis exhibited classic signs
   of the `island rule' effect, being larger, and likely flight-reduced
   compared to C. atratus. Our research reveals sudden extinction and
   replacement events within this anatid species complex, coinciding with
   recent human colonization of New Zealand. This research highlights the
   role of anthropogenic processes in rapidly reshaping island ecosystems

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{356}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{JUL 24}},
Abstract = {{In a world of increasing population and decreasing availability of
   arable land, the need to maintain and improve the quality of our farm
   systems is a clear and pressing one. Considerations of different types
   of capital give us a more holistic picture of what is at stake. Our
   decision-making mechanisms and tools must seek to integrate all types of
   capital, including natural and social capital, if we are to sustain
   long-term farm performance. Modeling is one way to integrate this
   `expanded' notion of capital. While farm modeling is not a new concept,
   this paper reviews various types of models with the aims of determining
   which is most suitable to demonstrate the effect of natural and social
   capital on farm risk, farm resilience, and farm well-being. As an
   industry particularly vulnerable to extreme weather patterns and other
   ecological hazards, the concepts of risk and resilience are critical to
   sustain long-term farm well-being. Various types of farm models are
   covered in this review, including land use cover and change,
   agent-based, statistical, system dynamics, and participatory modeling.
   The paper also identifies key characteristics that assist in modeling
   the effects of natural and social capital management. I conclude that an
   integrated, spatially explicit, participatory, systems-based modeling
   process is suggested to usefully incorporate natural and social capital
   effects on farm risk, resilience, and well-being. This approach can
   incorporate a whole systems approach, capture system `leverage points',
   and effectively involve affected stakeholders. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{The Darwinian interpretation (Di) of evolutionary process, and its
   subsequent development in the form of modern evolutionary synthesis
   (MES), plays a paradigmatic role in the mainstream biological thought.
   However, the main role in the improvement from Di to MES has depended on
   population genetics. Conventional ecosystem ecology has added relatively
   few specific insights to this endeavor in spite of the well-known
   combined selective influence from environment. This article integrates
   i) recent findings in genetics (i.e.: evolutionary capacitance); ii)
   orthodox topics as well as recent results from a large set of models in
   ecosystem ecology which have recently been encompassed under the term
   ``organic biophysics of ecosystem{''}; and an epistemological analysis
   of the origin of On the Origin of Species... by reaching four main
   particular conclusions: (a) Despite the contemporary recognition that
   any kind of interspecific relationship has an evolutionary influence,
   the analytical emphasis of Di and MES on competition has been
   unwittingly oversized because of the paradoxical manner in which
   mutualism can emerge as an essential evolutionary force starting from
   competition, being this an unpublished topic that is analyzed in this
   manuscript by the first time. This link between two interspecific
   relationships that seem opposite to each other at the first glance is
   based on quantum effects that are totally unknown in conventional
   evolutionary theory due to its bias in favor of genetics, neglecting
   ecological considerations by contrast. (6) A holistic combination of
   ecological, genetic and evolutionary insights at the ecosystem level
   additionally confirms that the analytical role of evolutionary
   gradualism has also been oversized. (c) The main criterion of
   evolutionary success conventionally applied by Di and MES should be
   modified given that: (d) the preferential direction of evolutionary
   process theoretically proposed by Di and MES does not match with the
   direction of spontaneous development of natural ecosystems. The final
   section of this manuscript explains that these four critical outcomes in
   regard to Di and MES seem to have their root in epistemological
   inaccuracies involved in the origin of On the Origin of Species...that
   have been passed from generation to generation without being subjected
   to interdisciplinary scrutiny. This article showcases the need to review
   some of the foundational principles of Di and MES before building a
   ``new floor{''} (i.e.: the extended evolutionary synthesis) supported on
   our current perspective about the evolutionary process. So,
   contrastingly with the genocentric nature of conventional evolutionary
   theory, large sections of our current evolutionary thought could change
   if we take into account some old results, as well as some recent ones,
   achieved by means of interdisciplinary approaches. In summary, this
   article concludes that the MES, despite its correct structure in
   essential points, could reach a significantly more complete
   epistemological condition than its current state if we add some
   fundamental results from ecosystem ecology that have been unwittingly
   neglected so far. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to establishing reference sites and
   determining hydromorphological characteristics for establishing
   type-specific hydromorphological reference conditions for rivers in the
   Czech Republic - the REFCON method - as well as its application. This
   method is based on hydromorphological river types. Using available maps
   and field surveys, it determines potential reference sites for
   establishing reference conditions, and subsequently, on the basis of an
   assessment of anthropogenic impacts using set criteria, it identifies
   stream reference sites.
   Reference sites and river types are validated using field survey data.
   This method also identifies characteristics of channel pattern, flow,
   riverbed structures, sediment, and variability of cross-sectional
   profiles used for establishing type-specific hydromorphological
   reference conditions. Reference conditions can be expressed using
   threshold values of individual characteristics (e.g., channel slope,
   entrenchment ratio, specific stream power); they can also be described
   qualitatively, that is, verbally (e.g., channel pattern, valley type).
   Nonetheless, reference conditions are always an expression of a set of
   characteristics or conditions that should be valid for a given river
   type.
   One of the expected results of applying this method is the creation of a
   reference site database for assessing hydromorphological status of
   streams. This database will serve for proposing stream restoration
   measures and also as a database of stream sections in need of protection
   from potential human impact. (C) 2017 European Regional Centre for

Abstract = {{The discovery and colonization of islands by humans has invariably

   provide information on both the variability of natural systems and
   responses to successive waves of cultural transformation of island

Abstract = {{Land-cover change, a major driver of the distribution and functioning of
   ecosystems, is characterized by a high diversity of patterns of change
   across space and time. Thus, a large amount of information is necessary
   to analyse change and develop plans for proper management of natural
   resources. In this work we tested MaxEnt algorithm in a completely
   remote land-cover classification and change analysis. In order to
   provide an empirical example, we selected south-eastern Italian Alps,
   manly Trentino-South Tyrol, as test region. We classified two Landsat
   images (1976 and 2001) in order to forecast probability of occurrence
   for tmsampled locations and to determine the best subset of predictors
   (spectral bands). A difference map for each land cover class,
   representing the difference between 1976 and 2001 probability of
   occurrence values, was built. In order to better address the patterns of
   change analysis, we put together difference maps and topographic
   variables. The latter are considered, at least in the study area, as the
   main environmental drivers of land-use change, in connection with
   climate change. Our results indicate that the selected algorithm,
   applied to land cover classes, can provide reliable data, especially
   when referring to classes with homogeneous texture properties and
   surface reflectance. The performed models had satisfactory predictive
   performance, showing relatively clear patterns of difference between the
   two considered time steps. The development of a methodology that, in the
   absence of field data, allow to obtain data on land use change dynamics,
   is of extreme importance for land planning and management.}},

Abstract = {{The connection between reproductive fitness and animal personality is

   we found high accuracy rules that predict which personalities are
   associated with fitness for two correlated measures of components of
   fitness applied a posteriori for classificatory purposes: fitness
   component (1) in terms of survival and short-term reproductive success,
   and fitness component (2) in terms of long term reproductive success
   which is indirectly related to survival of the parents. Animals are
   represented in the abstract as individuals with a genome that through
   time develops into certain characteristic behaviors and personalities.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first simulation study of its
   kind that extracts rules to investigate the link between personality and
   fitness. Clearly separated behaviors between fit and non-fit individuals
   emerged through the evolution of the population over time without
   top-down processing. Moreover, we did not employ a pre-defined fitness
   function, in order to minimize any possible biases toward a specific
   type of behavior. With respect to fitness component (1), we found that
   individuals with one of two extreme values of a personality trait
   (either bold or fearful) tend to be most fit, which agrees with
   empirical studies. With respect to fitness component (2), we found that
   when resources are low, fit individuals search for food whereas if food
   is abundant, they focus on reproduction, thereby suggesting the context
   dependence of fitness related behaviors. Once again, these results agree
   with empirical studies.}},

Abstract = {{New Zealand's Antarctic research began during the 1957/1958

   were the key research organisations, and after 1991, when the publicly
   funded research sector became more diverse. International collaborations
   have been important throughout. Funding decision processes have
   progressed from a bottom-up curiosity-driven approach to a more complex
   system of regular contests. Since 1991, the focus has been on coherent
   strategies and the outcomes sought. Funding criteria are well-defined
   and contests are widely accepted as fair and transparent. Reviews and
   evaluations have been positive. Collaborative organisational
   interactions dominated decision-making during the early period.
   Bureaucratic politics is most evident in post-1991 organisational
   changes. The quality of the research strategies has improved in terms of
   defining outcomes sought and appropriate measures of progress towards
   them. However, New Zealand's Antarctic research funding is currently
   dispersed. It needs better coordination. Collaborative research should

Abstract = {{Question: Most modern forest in eastern North America has recolonized
   after abandonment from agriculture. Cultivation and pasturing,
   historically the dominant forms of agriculture, differ in their
   environmental legacies and potentially influence stand development
   following abandonment. We ask how the legacy of agriculture plays out in
   development of second-growth stands, and whether tree community
   composition and structure differ between sites with contrasting land-use
   histories.
   Location: Southeast Ohio, USA.
   Methods: Thirty-five second-growth stands were sorted into a replicated
   chronosequence of formerly cultivated and pastured sites spanning 80yr.
   Stand age and land-use history were determined from historical aerial
   photographs and from site characteristics including microtopography and
   soil profiles. In addition, a control group was selected consisting of
   long-established forest stands showing no signs of agricultural
   disturbance. At each site stand composition and structure were described
   using the point-centred quarter method.
   Results: Stand density declined and basal area increased through the
   chronosequence but neither pastured nor cultivated sites reached levels
   observed in the control group. Density decreased most dramatically
   between the 41-60- and 61-80-yr age classes, consistent with competitive
   stand thinning. Tree community composition changed through time,
   reflecting a shift away from light-demanding successional species and
   toward long-lived, shade-tolerant species characteristic of
   long-established forests. Composition and structure did not differ
   significantly between cultivated and pastured sites, but individual
   species did show significant differences, with the greatest contrast
   evident shortly after abandonment.
   Conclusions: Stand development following agriculture appears to be a
   process of convergence in species composition and density. Because most
   deciduous forest in eastern North America is <80-yr-old, these results
   suggest that most forest is still accruing biomass and has yet to reach
   a stable density and composition.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency and severity of extreme climatic events are forecast to
   increase in the 21st century. Predicting how managed ecosystems may
   respond to climatic extremes is intensified by uncertainty associated
   with knowing when, where, and how long effects of extreme events will be
   manifest in an ecosystem. In water-limited ecosystems with high
   inter-annual variability in rainfall, it is important to be able to
   distinguish responses that result from seasonal fluctuations in rainfall
   from long-term directional increases or decreases in precipitation. A
   tool that successfully distinguishes seasonal from directional biomass
   responses would allow land managers to make informed decisions about
   prioritizing mitigation strategies, allocating human resource monitoring
   efforts, and mobilizing resources to withstand extreme climatic events.
   We leveraged long-term observations (2000-2013) of quadrat-level plant
   biomass at multiple locations across a semiarid landscape in southern
   New Mexico to verify the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI) time series derived from 250-m Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data as a proxy for changes in aboveground
   productivity. This period encompassed years of sustained drought
   (2000-2003) and record-breaking high rainfall (2006 and 2008) followed
   by subsequent drought years (2011 through 2013) that resulted in a
   restructuring of plant community composition in some locations. Our
   objective was to decompose vegetation patterns derived from MODIS NDVI
   over this period into contributions from (1) the long-term trend, (2)
   seasonal cycle, and (3) unexplained variance using the Breaks for
   Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) model. BFAST breakpoints in NDVI trend
   and seasonal components were verified with field-estimated biomass at 15
   sites that differed in species richness, vegetation cover, and soil
   properties. We found that 34 of 45 breaks in NDVI trend reflected large
   changes in mean biomass and 16 of 19 seasonal breaks accompanied changes
   in the contribution to biomass by perennial and/or annual grasses. The
   BFAST method using satellite imagery proved useful for detecting
   previously reported ground-based changes in vegetation in this arid
   ecosystem. We demonstrate that time series analysis of NDVI data holds
   potential for monitoring landscape condition in arid ecosystems at the
   large spatial scales needed to differentiate responses to a changing
   climate from responses to seasonal variability in rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{The growing number of artificial structures in estuarine, coastal and
   marine environments is causing ``ocean sprawl{''}. Artificial structures
   do not only modify marine and coastal ecosystems at the sites of their
   placement, but may also produce larger-scale impacts through their
   alteration of ecological connectivity - the movement of organisms,
   materials and energy between habitat units within seascapes. Despite the
   growing awareness of the capacity of ocean sprawl to influence
   ecological connectivity, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how
   artificial structures modify ecological connectivity in near- and
   off-shore environments, and when and where their effects on connectivity
   are greatest. We review the mechanisms by which ocean sprawl may modify
   ecological connectivity, including trophic connectivity associated with
   the flow of nutrients and resources. We also review demonstrated,
   inferred and likely ecological impacts of such changes to connectivity,
   at scales from genes to ecosystems, and potential strategies of
   management for mitigating these effects. Ocean sprawl may alter
   connectivity by: (1) creating barriers to the movement of some organisms
   and resources - by adding physical barriers or by modifying and
   fragmenting habitats; (2) introducing new structural material that acts
   as a conduit for the movement of other organisms or resources across the
   landscape; and (3) altering trophic connectivity. Changes to
   connectivity may, in turn, influence the genetic structure and size of
   populations, the distribution of species, and community structure and
   ecological functioning. Two main approaches to the assessment of
   ecological connectivity have been taken: (1) measurement of structural
   connectivity - the configuration of the landscape and habitat patches
   and their dynamics; and (2) measurement of functional connectivity - the
   response of organisms or particles to the landscape. Our review reveals
   the paucity of studies directly addressing the effects of artificial
   structures on ecological connectivity in the marine environment,
   particularly at large spatial and temporal scales. With the ongoing
   development of estuarine and marine environments, there is a pressing
   need for additional studies that quantify the effects of ocean sprawl on
   ecological connectivity. Understanding the mechanisms by which
   structures modify connectivity is essential if marine spatial planning
   and eco-engineering are to be effectively utilised to minimise impacts.

Abstract = {{There is an important role for indigenous and local knowledge in a
   Multiple Evidence Base to make decisions about the use of biodiversity
   and its management. This is important both to ensure that the knowledge
   base is complete (comprising both scientific and local knowledge) and to
   facilitate participation in the decision making process. We present a
   novel method to gather evidence in which we used a peer-to-peer
   validation process among farmers that we suggest is analogous to
   scientific peer review.
   We used a case-study approach to trial the process focussing on
   pollinator decline in India. Pollinator decline is a critical challenge
   for which there is a growing evidence base, however, this is not the
   case world wide. In the state of Orissa, India, there are no validated
   scientific studies that record historical pollinator abundance,
   therefore local knowledge can contribute substantially and may indeed be
   the principle component of the available knowledge base. Our aim was to
   collate and validate local knowledge in preparation for integration with
   scientific knowledge from other regions, for the purpose of producing a
   Multiple Evidence Base to develop conservation strategies for
   pollinators.
   Farmers reported that vegetable crop yields were declining in many areas
   of Orissa and that the abundance of important insect crop pollinators
   has declined sharply across the study area in the last 10-25 years,
   particularly Apis cerana, Amegilla sp. and.Xylocopa sp. Key pollinators
   for commonly grown crops were identified; both Apis cerana and Xylocopa
   sp. were ranked highly as pollinators by farmer participants. Crop yield
   declines were attributed to soil quality, water management, pests,
   climate change, overuse of chemical inputs and lack of agronomic
   expertise. Pollinator declines were attributed to the quantity and
   number of pesticides used. Farmers suggested that fewer pesticides, more
   natural habitat and the introduction of hives would support pollinator
   populations.
   This process of knowledge creation was supported by participants, which
   led to this paper being co-authored by both scientists and farmers.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation and management decisions for wild populations are often
   based on demographic estimates of abundance ((N) over cap), and less
   frequently, on genetic estimates of effective population size ((N) over
   cap (e)). We used genotype based methods to estimate both parameters
   from the same set of biopsy samples, while also providing information on
   the geographic closure of a local population of Hector's dolphins in
   Cloudy Bay, New Zealand. The assumption of closure in Cloudy Bay was
   supported by the lack of genetic differentiation between the two survey
   years and the absence of any genetically detectable migrants. Using
   recapture analysis based on genotype identifications, we estimated the
   abundance of individuals age 1(+) ((N) over cap (1+)) to be 269 (95\% CL
   = 233 - 319, CV = 0.12). This was similar to, but more precise than, (N)
   over cap = 230 (95\% CL = 130 - 407, CV = 0.30) from the more
   traditional analysis using contemporaneously collected
   photo-identifications. The (N) over cap (e) of the parental generation
   was 191 (95\% CL = 23 - 362), and the resulting (\$) over cap (e)/(\$)
   over cap (1+) of 0.71 was in reasonable agreement with species of
   similar life history characteristics. Although (N) over cap (e) was
   below the recommended threshold (500, recently increased to >= 1000)
   thought to be necessary to preserve long-term evolutionary potential in
   perpetuity, genetic connectivity with neighboring populations on a
   generational time scale is likely to mitigate the negative effects of
   low local N-e. Our work demonstrates the breadth of management-relevant
   information (e.g., N, N-e, sex ratio, genetic diversity, and
   connectivity to neighboring populations) that can be obtained from a
   genotype-based analysis, and how conservation implications can change
   when demographic and genetic population size are considered along with
   connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{1. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy enables chemical
   analysis of pollen samples for plant phenotyping to study
   plant-environment interactions, such as influence of climate change or
   pathogens. However, current approach, such as microspectroscopy and
   attenuated total reflection spectroscopy, does not allow for
   high-throughput protocols. This study at hand suggests a new
   spectroscopic method for high-throughput characterization of pollen.
   2. Samples were measured as thin films of pollen fragments using a
   Bruker FTIR spectrometer with a high-throughput eXTension (HTS-XT) unit
   employing 384-well plates. In total, 146 pollen samples, belonging to 31
   different pollen species of Fagaceae and Betulaceae and collected during
   three consecutive years (2012-2014) at locations in Croatia, Germany and
   Norway, were analysed. Critical steps in the sample preparation and
   measurement, such as variabilities between technical replicates, between
   microplates and between spectrometers, were studied.
   3. Measurement variations due to sample preparation, microplate holders
   and instrumentation were low, and thus allowed differentiation of
   samples with respect to phylogeny and biogeography. The spectral
   variability for a range of Fagales species (Fagus, Quercus, Betula,
   Corylus, Alnus and Ostrya) showed high-species-specific differences in
   pollen's chemical composition due to either location or year.
   Statistically significant inter-annual and locational differences in the
   pollen spectra indicate that pollen chemical composition has high
   phenotypic plasticity and is influenced by local climate conditions. The
   variations in composition are connected to lipids, proteins,
   carbohydrates and sporopollenins that play crucial roles in cold and
   desiccation tolerance, protection against UV radiation and as material
   and energy reserves.
   4. The results of this study demonstrate the value of high-throughput
   FTIR approach for the systematic collection of data on ecosystems. The
   novel FTIR approach offers fast, reliable and economical screening of
   large number of samples by semi-automated methodology. The
   high-throughput approach could provide crucial understanding on
   plant-climate interactions with respect to biochemical variation within
   genera, species and populations.}},

Abstract = {{Reciprocal co-evolving interactions between hosts and parasites are a
   primary source of strong selection that can promote rapid and often

   host-parasite interactions are also a major source of disease. Despite
   their importance, very little is known about the genomic basis of
   co-evolving host-parasite interactions in natural populations,

   evolution approaches to take critical steps towards characterizing the
   genomic basis of interactions between the freshwater snail Potamopyrgus
   antipodarum and its co-evolving sterilizing trematode parasite,
   Microphallus sp., a textbook example of natural coevolution. We found
   that Microphallus-infected P. antipodarum exhibit systematic
   downregulation of genes relative to uninfected P. antipodarum. The
   specific genes involved in parasite response differ markedly across
   lakes, consistent with a scenario where population-level coevolution is
   leading to population-specific host-parasite interactions and
   evolutionary trajectories. We also used an FST-based approach to
   identify a set of loci that represent promising candidates for targets
   of parasite-mediated selection across lakes as well as within each lake
   population. These results constitute the first genomic evidence for
   population-specific responses to co-evolving infection in the P.
   antipodarum-Microphallus interaction and provide new insights into the

   and forest landscape models We combined past trends with emerging issues
   to identify future needs.
   Historically, capacity to model forest dynamics at tree, stand, and

   and validation; computing capacity; model applicability to real-world
   problems; and ability to integrate biological, social, and economic
   drivers of change. As computing and data resources improved, a new class

   We are at a point of great opportunity in development and application of
   forest dynamics models. Past limitations in computing capacity and in
   data suitable for model calibration or evaluation are becoming less
   restrictive. Forest landscape models, in particular, are ready to
   transition to a central role supporting forest management, planning, and

Abstract = {{Aim: Human-induced climate change requires conservation strategies
   incorporating its potential effects on species and communities. Key
   components of population persistence can be attributed to resistance
   (the capacity to remain unaffected) or resilience (capacity to absorb
   and recover) to climate change. In situ climatic refugia can act as
   resistant distribution units, and ex situ climatic refugia and the
   corridors to reach them may enhance resilience. We develop a novel
   approach selecting conservation priorities, resistant units and
   resilient areas according to structural connectivity and future
   distribution, to identify strategies that maximize the chances of
   species persistence in a changing climate.
   Location: Italian Alps.
   Methods: Conservation priorities were defined across species according
   to the regional conservation status and the level of threat from climate
   change, and across sites according to their suitability for target
   species and their related potential for population persistence (in situ
   climatic refugia, i.e., resistant units) or redistribution (ex situ
   climatic refugia and main corridors according to current and future
   connectivity, i.e., resilient units).
   Results: Models suggested a marked loss of suitable area for all species
   by 2050 (ranging from similar to 50\% for pygmy owl and water pipit, to
   84\% for snowfinch in the worst scenario), and a general loss of
   connectivity, which was particularly marked for pygmy owl and snowfinch.
   The approach applied to Alpine birds of different habitats led to a
   spatially explicit definition of conservation priorities.
   Main conclusions: The spatial definition of conservation priorities
   according to species (regional importance and level of threat),
   resistance and resilience refines the definition of
   management/conservation priorities (including protected area
   definition), complementing the existing approaches to address climate
   change-induced threats in planning conservation and ecological networks.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Predicting accurate species responses to climate change in
   fragmented landscapes is challenging in conservation biogeography. We
   assessed the role of dispersal, including long-distance dispersal (LDD),
   for the long-term persistence of a rare plant species (Vella
   pseudocytisus subsp. paui) under current climate conditions and four
   future climate scenarios; and analysed the effect of competition for its
   regional survival.
   Location: Ester Iberian system, Aragon, Spain.
   Methods: We used BioMove, a linked modelling platform that integrates
   demographic, dispersal and competition features with biogeographic
   predictions of range dynamics, and whose results can inform risk
   assessments and conservation planning. We linked Vella's population
   dynamics and habitat suitability models with its well-documented life
   history traits and ecological characteristics to enhance our
   understanding of its inherent vulnerability to dispersal, competitive
   interactions and climate change.
   Results: We found thresholds in the effect of long dispersal distances
   on population persistence, suggesting a mid-distance optimum, which
   reduces mortality risk associated with the increasing proportion of LDD
   seeds. Moreover, increasing the proportion of LDD propagules reduces
   Vella's ability to compete in currently occupied and nearby unoccupied
   habitats by reducing the number of local recruitments.
   Main conclusions: Whereas LDD ability is generally assumed to be
   beneficial for the long-term persistence of plant species in fragmented
   landscapes, our results suggest that moderate to high distances between
   new colonization increase the species' dispersal-related mortality.
   Higher numbers of LDD events reduce the number of local propagules in
   established populations, reducing regional survival for Vella. Moreover,
   associated range shifts of potentially better climate-adapted
   competitors could prevent Vella individuals from colonizing new
   climatically suitable habitats. These findings can support development
   of more efficient conservation management strategies for establishing
   new population patches to mitigate population losses due to climate
   change. Our findings may also apply as a framework for other narrowly
   distributed endemic shrub species, particularly edaphic endemics.}},

   Understanding the broader impacts of wolf control efforts on the
   surrounding area is of particular concern for conservation agencies such
   as the United States National Park Service, whose mandates generally
   preclude the artificial reduction of populations of native predators,
   particularly for the primary purpose of increasing available prey
   biomass for human harvest. Detailed assessments of the factors
   influencing population vital rates (i.e., survival, natality, dispersal)
   and population trajectory in the context of control efforts are critical
   for understanding complex ecological relationships between wolves and
   their prey and informing management of each. Using a long-term dataset
   and a powerful new integrated modeling approach, we assessed the effects
   of wolf control on the dynamics of a monitored wolf population residing
   primarily within an adjacent protected area where wolf control
   activities were prohibited.
   We monitored wolf population dynamics in Yukon-Charley Rivers National
   Preserve (YUCH) in interior Alaska, USA for 22 years (1993-2014). During
   our study, 2 large-scale wolf control programs were implemented in the
   surrounding area with the primary goal of increasing the size of the
   Fortymile caribou herd. We used known-fate data based on relocations of
   marked wolves and repeated counts of associated pack mates to estimate
   survival, dispersal, and natality rates. We jointly analyzed these data
   using an integrated modeling approach, thereby providing inference to
   the entire resident, pack-dwelling population of wolves using YUCH.
   Apparent survival (i.e., including mortalities and dispersals) was lower
   in the study area during the lethal control period, indicating a direct
   additive effect of control despite the prohibition of control efforts
   inside YUCH boundaries. Apparent survival was higher in years following
   winters with above-average snowfall, corresponding with a predicted
   increase in ungulate prey vulnerability the following year.
   Extraterritorial forays were associated with lower apparent survival
   rates, particularly after the initiation of lethal wolf control in the
   surrounding area. In general, mortalities tended to occur evenly
   throughout the year, whereas dispersal rates increased during late
   winter and early spring. Dispersals accounted for approximately half of
   the observed losses in our collared sample across all age classes
   (excluding known breeders), although yearlings were the most likely to
   disperse.
   Sustained reductions in wolf densities outside the YUCH boundary during
   both wolf control programs also allowed us to directly assess the
   effects of reduced density on vital rates. Natality rates (estimated
   number of individuals added to each pack over the May-Aug interval)
   increased sharply over the course of each control program, suggesting a
   strong reproductive response to large-scale reductions in wolf densities
   in the surrounding area. Natality rates dropped rapidly between the 2
   control programs, further supporting this conclusion. Smaller pack sizes
   and losses of known breeders were associated with lower natality rates
   per pack in the following year, suggesting human-caused mortality could
   have direct short-term effects on productivity by reducing pack sizes
   and removing breeders. However, although control can reduce the
   fecundity of individual packs in the short term, adjacent populations
   quickly respond to reduced wolf density by increasing natality rates.
   Estimates of wolf density based on relocations of marked individuals
   within packs were dependent on sample size and could not be used to
   reliably estimate population growth rate (lambda). As an alternative, we
   developed a new metric, lambda{*}, which assessed whether natality was
   sufficient to offset population losses on an annual basis, under the
   assumption that the minimum functional unit in a wolf population is a
   breeding pair. When lambda{*} decreased below 1.0 because of a
   combination of loss of individuals and the dissolution of packs, the
   population of interest effectively became a population sink reliant on
   immigrants from surrounding areas for maintenance. Based on estimates of
   lambda{*}, we determined the YUCH study population was a source of
   wolves for the surrounding area in most years before implementation of
   lethal wolf control but became a population sink largely reliant on
   immigration from surrounding areas afterwards, despite the prohibition
   on control activities within YUCH. This finding has important
   implications for the management of protected areas, particularly in
   areas such as Alaska where wolf control is commonly implemented at large
   spatial scales. We expect lambda{*} will be a useful tool for
   understanding wolf ecology and managing populations in other areas as
   well.
   Overall, wolf vital rates were quite dynamic and responded quickly to
   changing conditions. The rapid increase in natality in an apparent
   response to decreased density strongly suggests that density dependence
   plays an important role in regulating wolf populations. Flexibility in
   dispersal and natality rates likely allow wolf populations to respond to
   variation in prey resources, wolf density, and mortality. These findings
   also suggest that sustainable harvest rates depend on annual variation
   in population vital rates. The clear impacts of management schemes in
   the area adjacent to YUCH suggests that effective conservation of
   protected areas may require more active management decisions than are
   often employed, particularly if the maintenance of unaltered system
   dynamics is a primary objective. (C) Published 2017. This article is a

Abstract = {{Depauperate understory plant communities resulting from intensive
   livestock grazing in pinyon-juniper woodlands of the western United
   States may represent degraded stable states, resistant to ecological
   restoration treatments. In this study, we analyzed 10-yr understory
   plant community responses to restoration treatments that included tree
   thinning to approximate historical densities of pinyon pine (Pinus
   edulis) and juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), scattering of thinning
   slash to improve soil conditions, and seeding at two woodland sites
   (Craig Ranch and Goose Pond) in northwestern Arizona. Results showed
   that thinning resulted in significant reductions in tree density at both
   sites, as well as reductions in tree basal area at the Goose Pond site.
   Boles, branches, and tops of the thinned trees scattered across the
   study sites resulted in few changes to woody surface fuel loading.
   Thinning and addition of woody material, along with seeding, resulted in
   only minor changes in understory cover and species richness at both
   sites. However, plant cover and species richness were both negatively
   correlated with tree density. Degraded conditions at the sites appeared
   to be stable, and we suggest that treatments implemented in our studies
   may have not been intensive enough to produce significant understory
   responses and meet restoration objectives. Managers aiming to restore
   understory diversity at similar sites may be required to use heavier
   thinning prescriptions and repeated seeding. More work is needed to test
   new restoration approaches that are designed to drive degraded
   pinyon-juniper woodlands over resilience thresholds toward more diverse

Abstract = {{Size is one of the most important biological traits influencing
   organismal ecology and evolution. However, we know little about the
   drivers of body size evolution in unicellulars. A long-term evolution
   experiment (Lenski's LTEE) in which Escherichia coli adapts to a simple
   glucose medium has shown that not only the growth rate and the fitness
   of the bacterium increase over time but also its cell size. This
   increase in size contradicts prominent `external diffusion' theory (EDC)
   predicting that cell size should have evolved toward smaller cells.
   Among several scenarios, we propose and test an alternative `internal
   diffusion-constraint' (IDC) hypothesis for cell size evolution. A change
   in cell volume affects metabolite concentrations in the cytoplasm. The
   IDC states that a higher metabolism can be achieved by a reduction in
   the molecular traffic time inside of the cell, by increasing its volume.
   To test this hypothesis, we studied a population from the LTEE. We show
   that bigger cells with greater growth and CO2 production rates and lower
   mass-to-volume ratio were selected over time in the LTEE. These results
   are consistent with the IDC hypothesis. This novel hypothesis offers a

Abstract = {{Understanding the dependence of species interaction strengths on
   environmental factors and species diversity is crucial to predict
   community dynamics and persistence in a rapidly changing world.
   Nontrophic (e.g. predator interference) and trophic components together
   determine species interaction strengths, but the effects of
   environmental factors on these two components remain largely unknown.
   This impedes our ability to fully understand the links between
   environmental drivers and species interactions. Here, we used a
   dynamical modelling framework based on measured predator functional
   responses to investigate the effects of predator diversity, prey
   density, and temperature on trophic and nontrophic interaction strengths
   within a freshwater food web. We found that (i) species interaction
   strengths cannot be predicted from trophic interactions alone, (ii)
   nontrophic interaction strengths vary strongly among predator
   assemblages, (iii) temperature has opposite effects on trophic and
   nontrophic interaction strengths, and (iv) trophic interaction strengths
   decrease with prey density, whereas the dependence of nontrophic
   interaction strengths on prey density is concave up. Interestingly, the
   qualitative impacts of temperature and prey density on the strengths of
   trophic and nontrophic interactions were independent of predator
   identity, suggesting a general pattern. Our results indicate that taking
   multiple environmental factors and the nonlinearity of density-dependent
   species interactions into account is an important step towards a better
   understanding of the effects of environmental variations on complex
   ecological communities. The functional response approach used in this
   study opens new avenues for (i) the quantification of the relative
   importance of the trophic and nontrophic components in species
   interactions and (ii) a better understanding how environmental factors
   affect these interactions and the dynamics of ecological communities.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose an ecological resilience point of view on
   cancer. This view is based on the analysis of a simple ODE model for the
   interactions between cancer and normal cells. The model presents two
   regimes for tumor growth. In the first, cancer arises due to three
   reasons: a partial corruption of the functions that avoid the growth of
   mutated cells, an aggressive phenotype of tumor cells and exposure to
   external carcinogenic factors. In this case, treatments may be effective
   if they drive the system to the basin of attraction of the cancer cure
   state. In the second regime, cancer arises because the repair system is
   intrinsically corrupted. In this case, the complete cure is not possible
   since the cancer cure state is no more stable, but tumor recurrence may
   be delayed if treatment is prolongued. We review three indicators of the
   resilience of a stable equilibrium, related with size and shape of its
   basin of attraction: latitude, precariousness and resistance. A novel
   method to calculate these indicators is proposed. This method is simpler
   and more efficient than those currently used, and may be easily applied
   to other population dynamics models. We apply this method to the model
   and investigate how these indicators behave with parameters changes.
   Finally, we present some simulations to illustrate how the resilience
   analysis can be applied to validated models in order to obtain
   indicators for personalized cancer treatments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The alteration of natural tree species composition is defined as the
   deviation of the current tree species composition from that of the
   natural state. It can be used as a measure of human influence on forest
   vegetation, and thus as an indicator of the naturalness of forest
   vegetation. The aim of the study was to develop a standard procedure for
   estimating the alteration of natural tree species composition, to
   explain factors driving alteration and to examine its significance for
   susceptibility of forest stands to natural disturbances. The alteration
   of natural tree species composition was estimated for the Dinaric region
   (5556 km(2), Slovenia) by the Robic Index of Dissimilarity (RID),
   ranging from 0 (completely natural) to 100 (completely altered). The
   index was calculated on the compartment level (24 ha each on average)
   with data on current and potential natural forest vegetation. The
   influence of human activities on tree species alteration was examined by
   using topographic and accessibility variables. The susceptibility of
   forest stands to natural disturbances was analysed with data on sanitary
   felling. In the study area, the natural tree species composition of
   forest stands is moderately preserved; the average value of RID was
   50.05, ranging from 1.76 to 100, and the coefficient of variation was
   0.49. The alteration of the natural tree species composition of forest
   stands is primarily the result of forest management and past land use,
   conditioned either by topography or accessibility of forests. The degree
   of alteration of tree species composition decreased along the gradients
   of rockiness, inclination and elevation. A greater degree of alteration
   appeared on the slopes of intermediate and south facing aspects than on
   north facing slopes, and in areas that were closer to the forest edge. A
   higher level of alteration significantly increases the susceptibility of
   forest stands to natural disturbances. The procedure represents a novel
   approach in modelling the alteration (naturalness) of tree species
   composition of forest vegetation. It is applicable at different spatial
   scales and fosters an understanding of the patterns of tree species
   composition under the influence of human activity across forest

Abstract = {{The oceans are changing more rapidly than ever before. Unprecedented
   climatic variability is interacting with unmistakable long-term trends,
   all against a backdrop of intensifying human activities. What remains
   unclear, however, is how to evaluate whether conditions have changed
   sufficiently to provoke major responses of species, habitats, and
   communities. We developed a framework based on multimodel inference to
   define ecosystem-based thresholds for human and environmental pressures
   in the California Current marine ecosystem. To demonstrate how to apply
   the framework, we explored two decades of data using gradient forest and
   generalized additive model analyses, screening for nonlinearities and
   potential threshold responses of ecosystem states (n = 9) across
   environmental (n = 6) and human (n = 10) pressures. These analyses
   identified the existence of threshold responses of five ecosystem states
   to four environmental and two human pressures. Both methods agreed on
   threshold relationships in two cases: (1) the winter copepod anomaly and
   habitat modification, and (2) sea lion pup production and the summer
   mode of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Considered collectively,
   however, these alternative analytical approaches imply that as many as
   five of the nine ecosystem states may exhibit threshold changes in
   response to negative PDO values in the summer (copepods, scavengers,
   groundfish, and marine mammals). This result is consistent with the idea
   that the influence of the PDO extends across multiple trophic levels,
   but extends current knowledge by defining the nonlinear nature of these
   responses. This research provides a new way to interpret changes in the
   intensities of human and environmental pressures as they relate to the
   ecological integrity of the California Current ecosystem. These insights
   can be used to make more informed assessments of when and under what
   conditions intervention, preparation, and mitigation may enhance
   progress toward ecosystem-based management goals.}},

Abstract = {{The drive to kill prey is central to understanding the population
   viability and ecological effects of large carnivores. This drive is
   modulated by behaviorally determined energetic expenditures, yet current
   methods of estimating the energetics of terrestrial carnivores are too
   coarse to inform the fine time scale behavioral decisions that incur the
   energetic costs leading to predation. Here, we use combined GPS and
   accelerometer collars calibrated to measure energetic outputs at scales
   of seconds to months on African leopards in Kenya. Fine-scale data on
   energetic expenditures and movement allowed us to determine
   energetically informed behavioral states that accurately identified when
   animals killed or scavenged prey, and allowed us to visualize novel
   details concerning the cryptic natural history of these predators. Our
   results revealed large variation in daily field metabolic rate ranging
   from 11,000 to 32,000 kJ depending on the animal and the specific
   behaviors undertaken. Leopards expended 47,470 kJ between kill events on
   average, but this was increased if meal size from the previous kill was
   large. Our methods also allowed us to estimate the energetic costs of
   dispersal, territorial patrol, and parental care, considered important
   factors in overall energetic balance and thus the drive to kill. Based
   on this approach, we demonstrate how the cycle of behavior, energetic
   expenditure, and predatory drive underlies population trajectories of
   large carnivores as well as their direct and indirect effects on

   split the species in potentially surviving species (x(i) > 0) and in
   others going extinct (x(i) = 0). We derived criteria for the stability
   of x(i) = 0 and for the equilibrium of x(i) > 0 to determine possible
   combinations of extinct and surviving species by iteratively applying a
   mixed binary linear optimization algorithm.
   We tested this new method against (a) the numerical solution at
   equilibrium of the LVC ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and (b)
   the fixpoints of all combinations of surviving and extinct species
   (possible only for small n), tested for stability and non-negativity.
   The tests revealed that COMMUSTIX is reliable, it detects all multiple
   stable fixpoints (SFPs), which is not guaranteed by solving the ODEs,
   and more efficient than the combinations method.
   With COMMUSTIX, we studied the dependence of the fixpoint behavior on
   the competition strengths relative to the intra-specific competition. If
   inter-specific competition was considerably lower than intra-specific
   competition, only globally SFPs occurred. In contrast, if all
   inter-specific was higher than intra-specific competition, multiple SFPs
   consisting of only one species occurred. If competition strengths in the
   species pool ranged from below to above the intra-specific competition,
   either global or multiple SFPs strongly differing in species composition
   occurred. The species richness over all SFPs was high for pools of
   species with similar, either weak or strong competition, and lower for
   species with dissimilar or close to intra-specific competition
   strengths.
   The new approach is a reliable and efficient tool for further extensive
   examinations of the dependence of community compositions on parameter
   settings of the LVC model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the ecological patterns of invasive species and their
   habitats require an understanding of the species' foraging ecology.
   Stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope values
   provide useful information into the study of animal ecology and
   evolution, since the isotope ratios of consumers reflect consumer's
   dietary patterns. Nevertheless, the lack of species- and
   element-specific laboratory-derived turnover rates could limit their
   application. Using a laboratory-based dual stable isotope tracer
   approach ((NaNO3)-N-15 and (NaHCO3)-C-13), we evaluated the delta N-15
   and delta C-13 isotope turnover rates in full-grown adult invasive
   Limnomysis benedeni from Lake Constance. We provide delta N-15 and delta
   C-13 turnover rates based on nonlinear least-squares regression and
   posterior linear regression models. Model precisions and fit were
   evaluated using Akaike's information criterion. Within a couple of days,
   the delta N-15 and delta C-13 of mysids began to change. Nevertheless,
   after about 14 days, L. benedeni did not reach equilibrium with their
   new isotope values. Since the experiment was conducted on adult
   subjects, it is evident that turnover was mainly influenced by
   metabolism (in contrast to growth). Unlike traditional dietary shifts,
   our laboratory-based dual stable isotope tracer approach does not shift
   the experimental organisms into a new diet and avoids dietary effects on
   isotope values. Results confirm the application of isotopic tracers to
   label mysid subpopulations and could be used to reflect assimilation and
   turnover from the labeled dietary sources. Field-based stable isotope
   studies often use isotopic mixing models commonly assuming diet-tissue
   steady state. Unfortunately, in cases where the isotopic composition of
   the animal is not in equilibrium with its diet, this can lead to highly
   misleading conclusions. Thus, our laboratory-based isotopic
   incorporation rates assist interpretation of the isotopic values from
   the field and provide a foundation for future research into using
   isotopic tracers to investigate invasion ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic conservation planning, a widely used approach to identify
   priority lands and waters, uses efficient, defensible, and transparent
   methods aimed at conserving biodiversity and ecological systems. Limited
   financial resources and competing land uses can be major impediments to
   conservation; therefore, participation of diverse stakeholders in the
   planning process is advantageous to help address broad-scale threats and
   challenges of the 21st century. Although a broad extent is needed to
   identify core areas and corridors for fish and wildlife populations, a
   finescale resolution is needed to manage for multiple, interconnected
   ecosystems. Here, we developed a conservation plan using a systematic
   approach to promote landscape-level conservation within the extent of
   the South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative. Our objective was
   to identify the highest-ranked 30\% of lands and waters within the South
   Atlantic deemed necessary to conserve ecological and cultural integrity
   for the 10 primary ecosystems of the southeastern United States. These
   environments varied from terrestrial, freshwater aquatic, and marine.
   The planning process was driven by indicators of ecosystem integrity at
   a 4-ha resolution. We used the program Zonation and 28 indicators to
   optimize the identification of lands and waters to meet the stated
   objective. A novel part of our study was the prioritization of multiple
   ecosystems, and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this
   approach. The evaluation of indicator representation within
   prioritizations was a useful method to show where improvements could be
   made; some indicators dictated hotspots, some had a limited extent and
   were well represented, and others had a limited effect. Overall, we
   demonstrate that a broad-scale (408,276 km(2) of terrestrial and 411,239
   km(2) of marine environments) conservation plan can be realized at a
   fine-scale resolution, which will allow implementation of the regional

Abstract = {{Modeling riparian plant dynamics along rivers is complicated by the fact
   that plants have different edaphic and hydrologic requirements at
   different life stages. With intensifying human demands for water and
   continued human alteration of rivers, there is a growing need for
   predicting responses of vegetation to flow alteration, including
   responses related to climate change and river flow management. We
   developed a coupled structured population model that combines
   stage-specific responses of plant guilds with specific attributes of
   river hydrologic regime. The model uses information on the vital rates
   of guilds as they relate to different hydrologic conditions (flood,
   drought, and baseflow), but deliberately omits biotic interactions from
   the structure (interaction neutral). Our intent was to (1) consolidate
   key vital rates concerning plant population dynamics and to incorporate
   these data into a quantitative framework, (2) determine whether complex
   plant stand dynamics, including biotic interactions, can be predicted
   from basic vital rates and river hydrology, and (3) project how altered
   flow regimes might affect riparian communities. We illustrated the
   approach using five flow-response guilds that encompass much of the
   river floodplain community: hydroriparian tree, xeroriparian shrub,
   hydroriparian shrub, mesoriparian meadow, and desert shrub. We also
   developed novel network-based tools for predicting community-wide
   effects of climate-driven shifts and deliberately altered flow regimes.
   The model recovered known patterns of hydroriparian tree vs.
   xeroriparian shrub dominance, including the relative proportion of these
   two guilds as a function of river flow modification. By simulating flow
   alteration scenarios ranging from increased drought to shifts in flood
   timing, the model predicted that mature hydroriparian forest should be
   most abundant near the observed natural flow regime. Multiguild
   sensitivity analysis identified substantial network connectivity (many
   connected nodes) and biotic linkage (strong pairwise connections between
   nodes) under natural flow regime conditions. Both connectivity and
   linkage were substantially reduced under drought and other
   flow-alteration scenarios, suggesting that community structure is
   destabilized under such conditions. This structured population modeling
   approach provides a useful tool for understanding the community-wide
   effects of altered flow regimes due to climate change and management
   actions that influence river flow regime.}},

Title = {{Community management indicators can conflate divergent phenomena: two

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{883-893}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Community indicators are used to assess the state of ecological
   communities and to guide management. They are usually calculated from
   monitoring data, often collected annually. Since any given community
   indicator provides a univariate summary of complex multivariate
   phenomena, different changes in the community may lead to the same
   response in the indicator. Sampling variation can also mask ecologically
   important trends.
   2. This study addresses these challenges for community indicators, with
   a focus on the large fish indicator (LFI), internationally used to
   report status of marine fish communities. The LFI expresses `large' fish
   biomass as a proportion of total fish biomass and is calculated from
   species-size-abundance data collected on trawl surveys. We develop new
   methods to decompose the contributions of species, sampling locations
   and season to trends over time in the LFI, and highlight consequences
   for assessment and management.
   3. Our results showed that both species and locations made divergent
   contributions to overall trends in the LFI indicator, with contributions
   differing by several orders of magnitude and in sign. Only small
   proportions of species and locations drove overall LFI trends, and their
   contributions changed with season (spring and autumn surveys). To assess
   significance of component trends, a resampling method was developed. Our
   method can be generalized and applied to many other community indicators
   based on survey data.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our new method for decomposing community
   indicators and generating confidence intervals makes it possible to
   extract much more information on what drives a `headline' indicator,
   providing a solution to challenges arising from multiple possible
   interpretations of changes in the indicator and from sampling variation.
   Analysis of the effects of indicator components on headline indicator
   values is recommended, because the results allow assessors and managers
   to identify and interpret how divergent factors (e.g. species, sampling
   locations and seasons) contribute to the headline indicator value.}},

Abstract = {{1. Habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, overexploitation and climate
   change pose familiar and new challenges to conserving natural
   populations throughout the world. One approach conservation planners may
   use to evaluate the effects of these challenges on wildlife populations
   is scenario planning.
   2. We developed an individual-based model to evaluate the effects of
   future land use and land cover changes on spring-migrating dabbling
   ducks in North America. We assessed the effects of three
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission scenarios (A1B, A2
   and B1) on dabbling duck stopover duration, movement distances and
   mortality. We specifically focused on migration stopover duration
   because previous research has demonstrated that individuals arriving
   earlier on the nesting grounds exhibit increased reproductive fitness.
   3. Compared to present conditions, all three scenarios increased
   stopover duration and movement distances of agent ducks.
   4. Although all three scenarios presented migrating ducks with increased
   amounts of wetland habitat, scenarios also contained substantially less
   cropland, which decreased overall carrying capacity of the study area.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Land-use change may increase waterfowl
   spring migration stopover duration in the midcontinent region of North
   America due to reduced landscape energetic carrying capacity. Climate
   change will alter spatial patterns of crop distributions with corn and
   rice production areas shifting to different regions. Thus, conservation
   planners will have to address population-level energetic implications of
   shifting agricultural food resources and increased uncertainty in yearly

Abstract = {{Jack pine-dominated ecosystems in northern Lower Michigan are heavily
   managed using a harvesting and planting regime designed to provide
   breeding habitat for the federally endangered Kirtland's warbler. These
   plantations do not resemble naturally-regenerated patterns of jack pine,
   but few data exist after which alternate planting configurations may be
   modeled.
   Our objective was to use quantitative analyses to construct new planting
   configurations that better mimic the spatial patterns of natural
   post-fire regeneration.
   We used high-resolution color imagery of a 2000 wildfire to map jack
   pine saplings and the point density function in ArcMap to quantify the
   spatial heterogeneity that follows large wildfires in this region. Based
   on metrics calculated from this analysis of landscape pattern, we used a
   neutral modeling approach to develop prototypical planting
   configurations.
   Jack pine regeneration in the burned area occurred as a series of
   high-density patches within a matrix of moderate- to low-density
   regeneration. In contrast, the planted areas were dominated by a single,
   high-density class with large patch sizes and little heterogeneity. We
   were able to construct neutral models that were not significantly
   different from the actual landscape using the metrics we calculated.
   Though highly successful for Kirtland's warbler habitat, current jack
   pine plantations in northern Lower Michigan do not emulate natural
   post-fire patterns. Quantifying the spatial pattern of regeneration
   following wildfires may inform neutral landscape models, which will be
   important tools for managers as they attempt to better emulate natural

Abstract = {{Aim: Scientists, governments and non-governmental organizations are
   increasingly moving towards the collection of large, open-access data.
   In aquatic sciences, this effort is expanding the scope of questions and
   analyses that can be performed to further our knowledge of the global
   drivers of water quality. Cyanotoxin concentration is one variable that
   has received considerable attention, and although strong local-scale
   models have been described in the literature, modelling cyanotoxin
   concentrations across broader spatial scales has been more difficult.
   Commonly used statistical frameworks have not fully captured the complex
   response of toxic algal blooms to global change, limiting our ability to
   predict and mitigate the impairment of freshwaters by toxic algae. Here,
   we advance our understanding of emergent drivers of cyanotoxins across a
   structured landscape by applying a hierarchical ``hurdle{''} model.
   Location: Lakes and reservoirs in the conterminous United States {[}n =
   1127].
   Methods: We studied cyanobacteria and their toxins {[}microcystins]
   during the 2007 summer period. We applied a hierarchical zero-altered
   model to test the importance of multi-scale interactions among
   environmental features in driving microcystin concentrations above the
   limit of detection. We then used boosted regression trees {[}BRTs] to
   identify environmental thresholds associated with severe impairment by
   microcystins.
   Results: Accounting for numerous non-detections, spatial heterogeneity
   and cross-scale interactions substantially improved continental-scale
   predictions of bloom toxicity. Our model accounted for 55\% of the
   variance in the probability of detecting microcystins across the United
   States, and 26\% of the variability in microcystin concentrations once
   detected. BRTs further showed that although both local and regional
   drivers were associated with microcystin concentrations at low to
   intermediate provisional guidelines, only local drivers came into play
   when predicting higher limits.
   Main conclusions: Identifying the interaction between local and regional
   processes is key to understanding the heterogeneous responses of
   microcystins to environmental change. Our framework could increase the
   effectiveness of continental-scale analyses for many different water
   variables.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{547-558}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The persistence of narrowly adapted species under climate change will
   depend on their ability to migrate apace with their historical climatic
   envelope or to adapt in place to maintain fitness. This second path to
   persistence can only occur if there is sufficient genetic variance for
   response to new selection regimes. Inadequate levels of genetic
   variation can be remedied through assisted gene flow (AGF), that is the
   intentional introduction of individuals genetically adapted to
   localities with historic climates similar to the current or future
   climate experienced by the resident population. However, the timing of
   reproduction is frequently adapted to local conditions. Phenological
   mismatch between residents and migrants can reduce resident x migrant
   mating frequencies, slowing the introgression of migrant alleles into
   the resident genetic background and impeding evolutionary rescue
   efforts. Focusing on plants, we devised a method to estimate the
   frequency of resident x migrant matings based on flowering schedules and
   applied it in an experiment that mimicked the first generation of an AGF
   program with Chamaecrista fasciculata, a prairie annual, under current
   and expected future temperature regimes. Phenological mismatch reduced
   the potential for resident x migrant matings by 40-90\%, regardless of
   thermal treatment. The most successful migrant sires were the most
   resident like in their flowering time, further biasing the genetic
   admixture between resident and migrant populations. Other loci
   contributing to local adaptationheat-tolerance genes, for instancemay be
   in linkage disequilibrium with phenology when residents and migrants are
   combined into a single mating pool. Thus, introgression of potentially
   adaptive migrant alleles into the resident genetic background is slowed
   when selection acts against migrant phenology. Successful AGF programs
   may require sustained high immigration rates or preliminary breeding
   programs when phenologically matched migrant source populations are

   on a rapid repeat basis. We tested the accuracy of Planet Dove data for

   underwater photographic surveys, we found that unsupervised

   in detecting the extent of shallow coral reef, observable portions of
   deep coral reef and sand. Dove data were deemed not sufficiently useful
   for separating different types of shallow reef or seagrass beds.
   Applying the 3-class mapping approach to 19 atolls throughout the

Abstract = {{Freshwater species are declining rapidly but more complete data are

   environmental DNA (eDNA) survey methods to identify changes in
   population distribution of a long-lived, imperiled stream salamander,
   the eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis:
   Cryptobranchidae). We used logistic regression with Bayesian inference
   to test whether selected environmental variables may be good predictors
   of hellbender population persistence and extirpation. Hellbenders
   persisted in only 42\% of the 24 historical record sites. The best fit
   model indicated electrical conductivity (EC) was the strongest predictor
   of hellbender population persistence (EC<278S/cm) and extirpation.
   Conductivity was strongly negatively correlated with canopy cover within
   the total watershed (r=-0.83, n=21, p<0.001) and riparian buffer of the

Abstract = {{Urban ecological risk (UER) caused by rapid urbanization means potential
   threat to urban ecosystem structure, pattern and services. The scales of
   ecological risk assessment (ERA) have been expanded from individual
   organisms to watersheds and regions. The types of stressor range from
   chemical to physical, biological and natural events. However, the
   application of ERA in urban ecosystems is relatively new. Here, we
   summarize the progress of urban ERA and propose an explicit framework to
   illumine future ERA based on UER identification, analysis,
   characterization, modeling, projection and early warning and management.
   The summary includes six urban ERA-relevant methods: weight-of-evidence
   (WoE), procedure for ecological tiered assessment of risks (PETAR),
   relative risk model (RRM), multimedia, multi-pathway, multi-receptor
   risk assessment (3MRA), landscape analysis and ecological models.
   Furthermore, we review critical cases of urban ERA in landscape ecology,
   soil, air, water and solid waste. Based on the Internet of Things (IoT)
   and cloud computing, an urban ERA management platform integrates various
   urban ERA methodologies that can be developed to provide better
   implementation strategies of UER for urban ecosystem managers and
   stakeholders. We develop a conceptual model of urban ERA based on the
   urban characteristics in China. The future applications of urban ERA
   include uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo techniques on the basis
   of geospatial techniques and comprehensive urban ERA using nonlinear
   models or process models.}},

   A modelling approach}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{351}},
Pages = {{87-95}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Hydrothermal time (HTT) models have been widely applied to describe the
   germination responses of seeds to temperature and water. Some HIT models
   assume that the thermoinhibition of germination is caused by an upward
   shift in base water potential psi(b(g)) that only happens above the
   optimum temperature To, and that To is a parameter independent of the
   water stress level. However, the available data suggest that these
   assumptions may be invalid in practice. We introduce a new HIT model
   that uses a log logistic distribution for psi(b(g))and assumes a linear
   increase in psi(b(g)) across both sub-and supra-optimal temperature
   ranges. We also provide explicit mathematical solutions for estimating
   To and other cardinal temperatures within a HTT modelling framework.
   Germination data were obtained for two winter annual plant species
   (Hordeum spontaneum and Phalaris minor) and used to build and test the
   model. For both species, the linear upward shift in psi(b(g))) was
   confirmed across both sub-and supra-optimal ranges, while the hydrotime
   constant theta(H) decreased nonlinearly with temperature. This interplay
   between OH and psi(b(g)) resulted in a curvilinear germination rate
   response to temperature that accounts for thermoinhibition of
   germination at high temperatures. The optimal temperature decreased
   proportionally with decreasing water potential and became cooler for
   higher (slower) germination fractions than for the lower (faster) ones.
   The new modelling approach not only gave good fits to germination data
   (with root mean square errors <10\%), but also provided useful insights
   about the adaptive strategies evolved by plant species to optimize their
   germination timing under the various temperature and moisture
   environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{351}},
Pages = {{96-108}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{The sustainability of coupled social-ecological systems (SESs) hinges on
   their long-term ecological dynamics. Land conversion generates
   extinction and functioning debts, i.e. a time-delayed loss of species
   and associated ecosystem services. Sustainability theory, however, has
   not so far considered the longterm consequences of these ecological
   debts on SESs. We investigate this question using a dynamical model that
   couples human demography, technological change and biodiversity. Human
   population growth drives land conversion, which in turn reduces
   biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services to agricultural production
   (ecological feedback). Technological change brings about a demographic
   transition leading to a population equilibrium. When the ecological
   feedback is delayed in time, some SESs experience population overshoots
   followed by large reductions in biodiversity, human population size and
   well-being, which we call environmental crises. Using a sustainability
   criterion that captures the vulnerability of an SES to such crises, we
   show that some of the characteristics common to modern SESs (e.g. high
   production efficiency and labor intensity, concave-down ecological
   relationships) are detrimental to their long-term sustainability.
   Maintaining sustainability thus requires strong counteracting forces,
   such as the demographic transition and land-use management. To this end,
   we provide integrative sustainability thresholds for land conversion,
   biodiversity loss and human population size - each threshold being
   related to the others through the economic, technological, demographic
   and ecological parameters of the SES. Numerical simulations show that
   remaining within these sustainable boundaries prevents environmental
   crises from occurring. By capturing the long-term ecological and
   socio-economic drivers of SESs, our theoretical approach proposes a new
   way to define integrative conservation objectives that ensure the
   long-term sustainability of our planet. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Conservation biologists should seek to work with those involved in

Abstract = {{Pastoral farming systems have always adapted to the seasonal
   availability of forage resources and climate variability by moving
   animals. However, the role of animal mobility as a possible mitigating
   strategy in response to climate change has not been clearly documented.
   To understand this role, we investigated (i) the major methodological
   challenges linked to the diversity of grazing areas and other forage
   resources exploited by these systems and enteric emissions of methane;
   (ii) the impacts of grazing practices (carbon sequestration/emission) on
   soil and biomass carbon fluxes. We developed an approach based on two
   existing models (OSTRAL: Outil de Simulation du TRoupeau ovin ALlaitant
   and CASA: Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach) that we adapted and used in
   combination. This approach was applied to three French Mediterranean
   sheep and crop farming systems with different degrees of flock mobility
   (sedentary, single transhumance and double transhumance). The
   preliminary results produced by the whole farm model OSTRAL showed that
   two systems (sedentary and double transhumance) causing low carbon
   emissions. In the sedentary system, higher animal productivity offsets
   the increase in GHG emissions (in CO(2)eq) caused by feed production. In
   the pastoral system, grazing reduced total GHG emissions (in CO(2)eq).
   The CASA model proved to be useful to simulate the carbon balance under
   dynamic land cover in natural environments, whether used for grazing or
   not. This model can help assess the impact of grazing practices and
   carbon fluxes in systems linked to natural environments. The results of
   the first application showed that seasonal mobility of livestock
   increases the contribution of rangeland to feeding systems and improves
   the non-renewable energy balance of the system. It is thus extremely
   important to include the specificities of animals grazing in rangelands
   outside the structural limits of the farm when evaluating GHG emissions.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In cities, human activities such as supplemental watering and plantings
   of ornamental species are thought to decouple vegetation diversity from
   biophysical processes. Consequently, socioeconomics may arguably be one
   of the most important factors influencing the pattern and dynamics of
   vegetation in urban ecosystems. Socioeconomic disturbances, like The
   Great Recession of 2007 to post-2010, disrupt normal social and economic
   activity causing changes to the ecology of cities that have yet to be
   examined. Using the rapidly growing metropolitan area of Phoenix,
   Arizona, USA, as a case study, we explored the dynamics of residential
   vegetation diversity from before to after The Great Recession. Our
   findings linked changing plant community composition and increasing
   richness with socioeconomics of the housing boom, (from 2000 to 2006)
   followed by the Great Recession (from 2007 to post-2010). Specifically,
   we found that the housing market boom-bust episode acted as a
   socioeconomic driver of overall plant community composition. However,
   plant species with annual reproduction strategies were instead linked to
   the previous winter's precipitation and did not respond to socioeconomic
   disturbance, a behavior expected in native desert plant communities, but
   not from constructed and managed urban plant communities. This study
   demonstrates how disturbances to socioeconomic components of ecosystems
   can result in changes to plant community diversity and dynamics; though,
   biophysical drivers remain important to short-lived annual species
   regardless. Undertakings that aim to maintain or increase urban
   biodiversity for ecosystem services and human well-being need to
   systematically approach the effects of socioeconomic fluctuations on
   urban flora. Cross-site comparisons will be key to developing a broader
   understanding of these coupled dynamics across older and newer, mesic

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{40-47}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Context Long-term viability of wildlife populations may be influenced by
   the adaptive or maladaptive nature of behavioural shifts. Yet, in the
   short term, implications of novel behaviour are often uncertain, as they
   were for a newly formed urban nesting colony of pied imperial-pigeons
   (PIPs) on the mainland coast of north-eastern Australia. It represented
   unprecedented behaviour, as most of PIPs, also known as Torresian
   imperial-pigeons, Ducula bicolor/spilorrhoa, breed colonially on remote
   small islands.
   Aims The present study would (1) determine whether aggregated mainland
   nesting continued, (2) evaluate reproductive success, (3) evaluate
   spatial distribution of nests and (4) explore possible association of
   reproductive success with predator presence and broad indicators of food
   availability.
   Methods With assistance from volunteers, we found mainland PIP nests and
   revisited them intermittently to monitor progress. We calculated
   quantitative estimates of nest survival by the Mayfield method and
   evaluated reproductive output in relation to environmental data from
   independent sources.
   Key results During the 2012, 2013 and 2014 breeding seasons, we recorded
   436, 387 and 417 PIP nest events at the new mainland colony. Daily
   nest-survival rates declined progressively and estimated fledgling
   output decreased over successive seasons from 0.66 to 0.44 per nest
   event. The highest mainland output was below that estimated for an
   island PIP colony (0.78) on the basis of sparse prior data. Across
   potential foraging grounds, there was no negative change in land use and
   no widespread adverse weather to account for diminishing success. We
   identified important causes of nest failure among mainland nesting PIPs
   to be predation, predominantly by birds, and anthropogenic hazards,
   including tree pruning and collisions with vehicles and windows of
   buildings.
   Conclusions With ongoing exposure to these hazards, mainland nesting
   PIPs cannot be expected to increase productivity; hence, the new colony
   may be a short-term phenomenon. We infer that the historic success of
   PIP populations in Queensland stems from their selection of breeding
   sites on remote islands that are largely free of relevant predators and
   anthropogenic activity.
   Implications Future conservation of extant PIP abundance will depend
   crucially on protection of island breeding sites, because multiple
   hazards of mainland nesting make it an unfavourable alternative
   strategy.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Using an appropriate accuracy measure is essential for assessing
   prediction accuracy in species distribution modelling. Therefore, model
   evaluation as an analytical uncertainty is a challenging problem.
   Although a variety of accuracy measures for the assessment of prediction
   errors in presence/absence models is available, there is a lack of
   spatial accuracy measures, i.e. measures that are sensitive to the
   spatial arrangement of the predictions. We present spind', a new
   software package (based on the R software program) that provides spatial
   performance measures for grid-based models. These accuracy measures are
   generalized, spatially corrected versions of the classical ones, thus
   enabling comparisons between them. Our method for evaluation consists of
   the following steps: 1) incorporate additional autocorrelation until
   spatial autocorrelation in predictions and actuals is balanced, 2)
   cross-classify predictions and adjusted actuals in a 4 x 4 contingency
   table, 3) use a refined weighting pattern for errors, and 4) calculate
   weighted Kappa, sensitivity, specificity and subsequently ROC, AUC, TSS
   to get spatially corrected indices. To illustrate the impact of our
   spatial method we present an example of simulated data as well as an
   example of presence/absence data of the plant species Dianthus
   carthusianorum across Germany. Our analysis includes a statistic for the
   comparison of spatial and classical (non-spatial) indices. We find that
   our spatial indices tend to result in higher values than classical ones.
   These differences are statistically significant at medium and high
   autocorrelation levels. We conclude that these spatial accuracy measures
   may contribute to evaluate prediction errors in presence/absence models,
   especially in case of medium or high degree of similarity of adjacent

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{761-774}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Promoting mixed-species forests is an important strategy for
   adaptation and risk reduction in the face of global change.
   Concurrently, a main challenge in ecology is to quantify the effects of
   species diversity on ecosystem functioning. In forests, the effects of
   individual tree species on ecosystem functions depend largely on their
   dimensions, which are commonly predicted using allometric equations.
   However, little is known about how diversity influences allometry or how
   to incorporate this effect into allometric equations. Ignoring the
   effects of interspecific interactions on allometric relationships may
   result in severely biased predictions.
   2. This study examined the effects of tree-species diversity,
   competition and tree social status on crown-projection area (cpa),
   height (h) and live-crown length (lcl) of trees using a European-wide
   data set containing 17 target species and 12 939 trees. The cpa, h and
   lcl were predicted as functions of stem diameter at 1.3 m, tree-species
   diversity, tree height relative to the stand mean height (rh) and a
   competition index (CI) that accounted for stand density and
   interspecific differences in competitive ability based on
   species-specific wood density or shade tolerance.
   3. Averaged across species, diameter had the greatest effect on cpa and
   lcl, followed by the competition index, while rh had the greatest effect
   on lcl. Tree-species diversity had the smallest effect on cpa, h and
   lcl. Interspecific variability in cpa, h or lcl responses to diversity,
   CI, or rh was sometimes related to wood density or shade tolerance.
   4. Synthesis. This study shows the strong influence of stand structure
   and species composition on allometric relationships. These influences
   can be quantified using measures of competition, tree-species diversity
   and relative tree height so that general equations can be developed for
   a given species to be applied to a wide range of species compositions
   and stand structures. This new approach will greatly improve predictions
   of biomass and carbon stocks in structurally and compositionally diverse
   forests.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{198-218}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Regime shifts are difficult-to-reverse transitions that occur when an
   ecosystem reorganizes around a new set of self-reinforcing feedbacks.
   Regime shifts are predicted to occur when the intensity of some
   exogenous driver variable, such as temperature, annual harvest rate, or
   nutrient addition rate, gradually approaches and crosses a threshold
   value, initiating a transition to an alternative state. However, many
   driver variables now change rapidly as presses or pulses, not gradually,
   requiring new conceptual frameworks for understanding and predicting
   regime shifts. We argue that identifying and controlling regime shifts
   in response to presses and pulses will require a greater focus on the
   duration, not just the intensity, of changes in driver variables. In
   ecosystems with slower dynamics, transitions to an alternative state can
   take years to decades and as a result, a driver press with an intensity
   capable of resulting in a regime shift over long time spans may fail to
   cause a regime shift when applied for shorter durations. We illustrate
   these ideas using simulations of local-scale alternative stable state
   models and preliminary evidence from long-term grazing and
   eutrophication experiments. The simulations also suggest that small
   changes in the duration of driver presses or pulses can determine
   whether an ecosystem recovers to its original state. These insights may
   extend to larger scales. In spatially extended simulations that included
   patchiness, spatial heterogeneity, and spatial connectivity, all patches
   recovered to their original state after shorter presses. However, once
   press duration exceeded a threshold, growing proportions of the
   landscape shifted to an alternative state as press duration increased.
   We observed similar patchy transitions in a catchment-scale experiment
   that reinstated frequent fires approximately halfway through a regime
   shift from grassland to shrubland, initiated by fire suppression. In
   both the local-and larger-scale models, the threshold duration needed to
   elicit regime shifts decreased as press intensity increased or when
   factors counteracting regime shifts weakened. These multiple lines of
   evidence suggest that conceptualizing regime shifts as an interactive
   function of the intensity and duration of driver changes will increase
   understanding of the varying effects of driver presses, pulses, and
   cycles on ecosystem dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Lethal control of wildlife represents an ethical concern for managers,
   exacerbated by a lack of replicated or controlled data for most taxa or
   regions. The Gulf of Maine (GOM) has a history of intensive lethal and
   nonlethal predator control to protect terns (Sterna spp.) from inflated
   populations of predatory gulls, especially herring (Larus argentatus)
   and great black-backed gulls (L. marinus; large gulls). We described
   management strategies in the GOM, reviewed methods of nonlethal and
   lethal types of control, and compared the effectiveness of 3 control
   regimes (lethal, nonlethal-only, and no control) using weighted means of
   reproductive success metrics for 4 tern species. Nonlethal-only control
   is the least effective method of predator control; lethal control is
   consistently the most effective. Arctic terns (Sterna paradisaea) were
   the most susceptible to predation, whereas common terns (Sterna hirundo)
   were the most resilient. We concluded that targeted lethal control is
   necessary in the GOM to protect tern colonies from depredation and
   nesting exclusion by large gulls, and cannot be substituted with
   nonlethal control. Cessation of lethal control leads to abandonment of
   tern colonies within 6-7 years, but resumption of appropriately timed
   lethal control can lead to recolonization the same year. A combination
   of nonlethal and lethal methods can minimize the number of gulls taken.
   We recommend that any application of lethal control carefully considers
   the local needs of any target species and recognizes the need for
   spatial and temporal commitment. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society.
   We reviewed literature from Virginia to Quebec, Canada, to analyze tern
   reproductive success under 3 different predator control regimes (lethal,
   nonlethal-only, or no control of large gulls) on 4 species of tern
   (Arctic, common, roseate, and least). Nonlethal-only control represented
   the least effective control regime, especially for Arctic and roseate
   terns; lethal control was the most effective. Lethal control is
   confirmed to be a necessary annual management activity to prevent
   extirpation of tern colonies in the Gulf of Maine.}},

Title = {{Structural uncertainty limits generality of fall harvest strategies for

Abstract = {{Wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) populations are broadly distributed,
   occupy a variety of habitats, and have demographic rates that are
   heterogeneous through space and time. Dynamics of turkey populations are
   sensitive to the magnitude of fall either-sex harvest, yet there have
   been few attempts to study performance of fall harvests systematically
   across a range of plausible demographic scenarios. Thus robustness of
   existing recommendations to structural uncertainty in population
   dynamics is marginally understood. We used a stochastic, sex-specific
   theta-logistic model to simulate performance of fall harvests (0-15\%)
   across scenarios representing uncertainty about current rates of
   population productivity (3 levels), female losses during spring hunting
   (2 levels), and spring male harvest (3 levels), with uncertainty in the
   strength of density dependence as a common attribute. We demonstrated
   that performance of previously recommended fall harvests was not robust
   to changes in demographic parameters that occur within and among
   populations, and thus previous management recommendations may not be
   appropriate for all regions. Fall harvest rates capable of maintaining
   large populations with high probability varied from 0-6\% with changes
   to population productivity, when median male and female spring harvests
   were 30\% and 5\%, respectively. In general, risks and management
   tradeoffs accompanying fall harvests were tightly linked to assumed
   values of population parameters, where changes to productivity and
   female loss had particularly strong effects on management outcomes.
   Specifically, reduced productivity or increased female loss decreased
   the ability to maintain large populations for a given fall harvest rate.
   Thus, fall harvest recommendations deduced from models that considered
   only a small portion of the demographic parameter space may not meet
   modern management objectives over a broader range of conditions.
   Moreover, our results suggest that future management could be improved
   by reducing structural uncertainty about turkey demography to allow for
   region-specific harvest strategies, or by using decision-theoretic
   approaches to identify harvest strategies that are robust to uncertainty
   about population parameters. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society.
   We used stochastic simulation to test the generality of currently
   accepted fall harvest guidelines for wild turkeys in the presence of
   uncertainty about system dynamics that is relevant to the modern era of
   turkey management. Current fall harvest recommendations are not robust
   to uncertainties that are ubiquitous to modern turkey management, and
   consideration of structural uncertainty in population dynamics should be
   explicitly incorporated into the development of turkey harvest
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The Nearctic northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis atricapillis) is a
   resident of conifer, broadleaf, and mixed forests from the boreal to the
   southwestern montane regions of North America. We report on a 20-year
   mark-recapture investigation (1991-2010) of the distribution and density
   of breeders, temporal and spatial variability in breeding, nestling sex
   ratios, local versus immigrant recruitment of breeders, breeding age
   structure, age-specific survival rates, and rate of population change ()
   of this species on the Kaibab Plateau, a forested sky island in northern
   Arizona, USA. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank models
   representing alternative hypotheses about the influence of annual
   fluctuations in precipitation on the annual frequency of goshawk
   breeding and fledgling production. We studied 125 goshawk breeding
   territories, representing approximately 87\% of an estimated 144 total
   territories based on a mean distance of 3.8km between territory centers
   in a 1,728-km(2) study area. The salient demographic feature of the
   population was extensive annual variation in breeding, which manifested
   as large inter-annual variation in proportions of pairs laying eggs,
   brood sizes, nest failure rates, and fledgling production. The percent
   of territories known in a prior year in which eggs were laid in a
   current year ranged from 8\% to 86\% (x=37\%, SE=4.51), annual mean nest
   failure rate (active nests that failed) ranged from 12\% to 48\%
   (overall x=23\%, SE=2.48), and mean annual brood size of successful
   nests (fledged 1 fledgling) ranged from 1.5 young to 2.5 young (overall
   x=2.0 young, SE=0.03). Inter-annual variation in reproduction closely
   tracked inter-annual variation in precipitation, which we hypothesize
   influenced primary forest productivity and bird and mammal prey
   abundance. The best breeding years (1992-1993, 77-87\% of pairs laid
   eggs) were coincident with a record-long El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) wet period and the worst breeding year (2003; 8\% of pairs laid
   eggs) was the last of a 3-year record drought. Overall breeding success
   was 83\% with most failures occurring during incubation; once eggs
   hatched, goshawks tended to fledge young. The pooled 20-year nestling
   sex ratio did not differ from unity (53\% M; n=410M, 366F) but was
   significantly male-biased in 2 years and female-biased in 1 year.
   Nonetheless, the overall greater production of male fledglings followed
   a strong trend of greater male production in other goshawk populations,
   suggesting that breeders might have been adaptively adjusting their
   offspring sex ratio, perhaps to produce more of the rarer (male) sex.
   Annual recruitment of new individuals into the breeding population
   averaged 43\% during the study. Study area recruitment rate of hawks
   locally born (in situ) and banded was 0.12. Both sexes had equal
   tendencies to return to the Kaibab Plateau to breed (no differences in
   philopatry) and there were no differences in natal dispersal distances
   (natal to first breeding site) between the sexes. During the final years
   of study (1999-2010), an estimated 46\% of breeding recruits were
   locally born and 54\% were immigrants from distant forests. Minimum age
   at first breeding was 2 years and mean age at first breeding by
   known-age hawks (banded as nestlings or aged on plumage at first
   breeding) was 3.7 years for males and 3.5 years for females. Mean
   lifespan (yr from first banding as nestling to last resighting) of
   known-age goshawks was 6.9 years for both sexes.
   Mean minimum apparent lifespan of breeders aged 4 years based on plumage
   at first capture was 6.5 years for both sexes. Average age of goshawks
   at their first detection was 3.9 years old, at which time apparent
   survival was estimated at 0.77 for both sexes, which was just slightly
   less than the peak survival of 0.78 as a function of age. Age-specific
   survival estimates showed a steady decline after 9 years old and
   approached 0 at 20 years of age. Estimates of for breeding adults (M,
   0.94, SE=0.037; F, 0.98, SE=0.038) provided only weak evidence for a
   population decline during the study. Although sex was not in the top
   survival model, models including age+sex were competitive, evidencing
   lower male than female survival, a finding corroborated by the
   occurrence of sex effects in the top model. Lower male survival may
   result from higher mortality associated with hunting agile prey in
   vegetation-filled environments during long breeding seasons when they
   are the primary forager. Lower survival may be compensated by the more
   frequent production (53\%) of male fledglings. High-severity crown fire
   was an existential threat to the population. In addition to 4 large
   high-severity fires that burned roughly 3,770ha (equal to 3 goshawk
   territories) in the 30 years preceding 1991, 6 high-severity fires
   burned another 30,945ha during our study and killed most (>64\%) of the
   forests in 8 known territories and possibly another 2 that were burned
   before we completed surveys. Based on a lack of any recent demographic
   perturbations in age structure, a relatively high and time-constant
   annual adult survival rate, confidence intervals around adult estimates
   overlapping 1.0, and a study area saturated with territories, we surmise
   that the goshawk population on the Kaibab Plateau was stable during the
   20-year study. Nonetheless, uncertainty remains regarding the
   population's future status because of a declining trend in breeding
   frequency, uncertain status (dead, alive, emigrated) of non-breeding
   adults, extensive temporal and spatial variation in breeding, and high
   frequency of immigrant recruits to the breeding population on the Kaibab
   Plateau. If the century-long decline in precipitation persists,
   especially at the increased rate seen since 1980, and manifests as
   deeper droughts, diminished wet periods, and weaker pulses in forest
   productivity, then the Kaibab Plateau goshawk population would be
   expected to show unambiguous evidence of decline. Evidence would include
   reduced local and regional goshawk reproduction and survival, reduced
   frequency of immigration, and further habitat loss to catastrophic fire.

Abstract = {{Intensification of the global hydrological cycle, ranging from larger
   individual precipitation events to more extreme multiyear droughts, has
   the potential to cause widespread alterations in ecosystem structure and
   function. With evidence that the incidence of extreme precipitation
   years (defined statistically from historical precipitation records) is
   increasing, there is a clear need to identify ecosystems that are most
   vulnerable to these changes and understand why some ecosystems are more
   sensitive to extremes than others. To date, opportunistic studies of
   naturally occurring extreme precipitation years, combined with results
   from a relatively small number of experiments, have provided limited
   mechanistic understanding of differences in ecosystem sensitivity,
   suggesting that new approaches are needed. Coordinated distributed
   experiments (CDEs) arrayed across multiple ecosystem types and focused
   on water can enhance our understanding of differential ecosystem
   sensitivity to precipitation extremes, but there are many design
   challenges to overcome (e. g., cost, comparability, standardization).
   Here, we evaluate contemporary experimental approaches for manipulating
   precipitation under field conditions to inform the design of `
   Drought-Net', a relatively low-cost CDE that simulates extreme
   precipitation years. A common method for imposing both dry and wet years
   is to alter each ambient precipitation event. We endorse this approach
   for imposing extreme precipitation years because it simultaneously
   alters other precipitation characteristics (i. e., event size)
   consistent with natural precipitation patterns. However, we do not
   advocate applying identical treatment levels at all sites -a common
   approach to standardization in CDEs. This is because precipitation
   variability varies > fivefold globally resulting in a wide range of
   ecosystem-specific thresholds for defining extreme precipitation years.
   For CDEs focused on precipitation extremes, treatments should be based
   on each site's past climatic characteristics. This approach, though not
   often used by ecologists, allows ecological responses to be directly
   compared across disparate ecosystems and climates, facilitating
   process-level understanding of ecosystem sensitivity to precipitation
   extremes.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of a system dynamics (SD) model, a cellular automata
   (CA) model, and a Geographic Information System (GIS) is an important
   topic in the temporal and spatial simulation of land-use changes. Based
   on many previous studies, the temporal-spatial dynamics method (TSDM)
   has been proposed as a research framework that removes the limitations
   of using loosely coupled SD-CA-GIS. In this study, TSDM was successfully
   implemented in the NetLogo platform. The results show that: (1)
   Integration SD-CA-GIS based on grids leads to the seamless
   implementation of real-time data exchange among SD, CA, and GIS; (2) The
   temporal-spatial dynamic mechanisms can be represented using common time
   steps in SD-CA-GIS, and TSDM can be used for spatial visualization; and
   (3) The model accuracy can be improved by extending the CA transition
   rules with SD. The land-use patterns for 2000, 2010, and 2016 in
   Beijing, China, were simulated to test the TSDM implementation, and the
   simulation accuracies were 83.75\%, 80.98\%, and 77.40\%, respectively.
   The results indicate that TSDM achieves a much better accuracy than

Abstract = {{To successfully manage marine fisheries using an ecosystem-based
   approach, long-term predictions of fish stock development considering
   changing environmental conditions are necessary. Such predictions can be
   provided by end-to-end ecosystem models, which couple existing physical
   and biogeochemical ocean models with newly developed spatially-explicit
   fish stock models. Typically, individual-based models (IBMs) and models
   based on advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equations are employed for
   the fish stock models. In this paper, we present a novel fish stock
   model called SPRAT for end-to-end ecosystem modeling based on population
   balance equations (PBEs) that combines the advantages of IBMs and ADR
   models while avoiding their main drawbacks. SPRAT accomplishes this by
   describing the modeled ecosystem processes from the perspective of
   individuals while still being based on partial differential equations.
   We apply the SPRAT model to explore a well-documented regime shift
   observed on the eastern Scotian Shelf in the 1990s from a cod-dominated
   to a herring-dominated ecosystem. Model simulations are able to
   reconcile the observed multitrophic dynamics with documented changes in
   both fishing pressure and water temperature, followed by a predator-prey
   reversal that may have impeded recovery of depleted cod stocks.
   We conclude that our model can be used to generate new hypotheses and
   test ideas about spatially interacting fish populations, and their joint
   responses to both environmental and fisheries forcing. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{45-58}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{There has been extensive effort to quantify the biodiversity response to
   climate change. Bioclimatic models are widely used to correlate species
   landscape distributions with macroclimate, projecting and then comparing
   suitable climate space at a baseline and for future climate change
   scenarios. This bioclimatic approach has two assumptions: 1. Species
   distributions are at equilibrium with, and represent direct sensitivity,
   to macroclimate; 2. Relationships among climate predictors remain
   comparable when extrapolating from baseline to climate change scenarios.
   In contrast, species distributions have multiple drivers and may fail to
   reflect direct climate sensitivity. Furthermore, future climate change -
   especially at weekly or monthly timescales - may include novel
   combinations of temperature, moisture, and solar irradiance, without
   present-day analogues. Bioclimatic assumptions are especially
   problematic for subdominant guilds such as epiphytes. Controlled growth
   experiments were conducted over 25 months, for three ecologically
   different lichen epiphyte species, across three climatically contrasting
   botanic garden sites. There was correspondence between the response to
   climate ( growth rate) and landscape distribution for two out of the
   three species, in support of bioclimatic modelling at the baseline. In
   addition, statistical growth models at monthly resolution were used to
   understand how projected outcome ( increased or decreased growth
   comparing baseline with 2080s climate) might be sensitive to choice of
   model predictors. Model projections were highly sensitive to
   non-analogue future climates, including novel monthly combinations of
   moisture and irradiance. These discrepancies in a species projected
   outcome: 1. Send a caveat to the interpretation of coarser-grained
   bioclimatic models, e.g. those based on annual climate averages at
   kilometre grid-scales; 2. Identify irradiance as a necessary covariable
   in bioclimatic models. Statistical partitioning of contrasting species
   response - focussed on species identify, choice of model predictors and
   location - provides structured recommendations for the future
   development of biologically-realistic and downscaled growth models. (C)

Abstract = {{Soil granulometric composition can impose constraints on ant species
   living in ground habitats, being an important factor in defining the
   habitat templet, which describes how certain animal life histories,
   including the trait of body size, can be selected. The ant fauna plays a
   central role in soil formation, and a vast literature describes such
   influence, but not the converse. Along with termites, worms and other
   invertebrates, these organisms promote the formation of channels, pores,
   and aggregates that influence gases and water moving through the soil
   profile. On the other hand, it is important to understand whether soil
   traits constrain insect colonization, so we here ask how soil traits can
   influence niche specificities, which seems to be a neglected ecological
   issue. A literature search using the key words `ants or Formicidae' and
   `soil structure or pedogenesis' revealed numerous references dealing
   with the influence of ants on soil, but not conversely. We here present
   a novel geomorphologic approach to habitat templets for two distinct
   riparian Neotropical ecosystems, based on the amalgamation of
   soil/sediment analysis with ecological processes and ant species
   biology. We found that predominance of fine grains favoured the
   preponderance of small ant species at a threshold of < 5 mm in body

Abstract = {{An emerging planning framework for climate adaptation focuses on
   interactions among societal values, institutional rules and scientific
   and experiential knowledge about biophysical impacts of climate change
   and adaptation options. These interactions shape the decision context
   that can enable or constrain effective adaptation. To illustrate the
   operationalisation of this `values-rules-knowledge' (VRK) framework we
   developed biophysical adaptation pathways for agricultural landscapes of
   south-eastern Australia, which are expected to become warmer and drier
   under climate change. We used the VRK framework to identify potential
   constraints to implementing the pathways. Drawing on expert knowledge,
   published literature, biodiversity modelling and stakeholder workshops
   we identified potential adaptation pathways for (1) the production
   matrix, (2) high conservation value remnant eucalypt woodlands, and (3)
   woodland trees. Adaptation options included shifts from mixed cropping
   grazing to rangeland grazing or biomass enterprises; promoting
   re-assembly of native ecological communities; and maintaining ecosystem
   services and habitat that trees provide. Across all pathways, applying
   the VRK framework elucidated fifteen key implementation constraints,
   including limits to farm viability, decreasing effectiveness of
   environmental legislation and conflicting values about exotic plants.
   Most of the constraints involved interactions among VRK; 13 involved
   rules, eight involved values, and seven involved knowledge. Value
   constraints appeared most difficult to address, whereas those based on
   rules or knowledge were more tangible. The lower number of knowledge
   constraints may reflect the scale of our analysis (which focused on
   decision points in pre-defined pathways); new knowledge and
   participatory approaches would likely yield a richer set of scenarios.
   We conclude that the VRK framework helps connect the biophysical
   knowledge-based view of adaptation with a perspective on the need for
   changes in social systems, enabling targeting of constraints to
   adaptation. Our focus on pathways and decision points in different
   sectors of the multi-use landscape highlighted the importance of group
   and higher level planning and policy for balancing the collective
   outcomes of multiple decisions by many land managers. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An accurate and objective estimate on the extent of agroforestry in
   Europe is critical for the development of supporting policies. For this
   reason, a more harmonised and uniform Pan-European estimate is needed.
   The aim of this study was to quantify and map the distribution of
   agroforestry in the European Union. We classified agroforestry into
   three main types of agroforestry systems: arable agroforestry, livestock
   agroforestry and high value tree agroforestry. These three classes are
   partly overlapping as high value tree agroforestry can be part of either
   arable or livestock agroforestry. Agroforestry areas were mapped using
   LUCAS Land Use and Land Cover data (Eurostat, 2015). By identifying
   certain combinations of primary and secondary land cover and/or land
   management it was possible to identify agroforestry points and stratify
   them in the three different systems. According to our estimate using the
   LUCAS database the total area under agroforestry in the EU 27 is about
   15.4 million ha which is equivalent to about 3.6\% of the territorial
   area and 8.8\% of the utilised agricultural area. Of our three studied
   systems, livestock agroforestry covers about 15.1 million ha which is by
   far the largest area. High value tree agroforestry and arable
   agroforestry cover 1.1 and 03 million ha respectively. Spain (5.6
   million ha), France (1.6 million ha), Greece (1.6 million ha), Italy
   (1.4 million ha), Portugal (1.2 million ha), Romania (0.9 million ha)
   and Bulgaria (0.9 million ha) have the largest absolute area of
   agroforestry. However the extent of agroforestry, expressed as a
   proportion of the utilised agricultural area (UAA), is greatest in
   countries like Cyprus (40\% of UAA), Portugal (32\% of UAA) and Greece
   (31\% of UAA). A cluster analysis revealed that a high abundance of
   agroforestry areas can be found in the south-west quadrat of the Iberian
   Peninsula, the south of France, Sardinia, south and central Italy,
   central and north-east Greece, south and central Bulgaria, and central
   Romania. Since the data were collected and analysed in a uniform manner
   it is now possible to make comparisons between countries and identify
   regions in Europe where agroforestry is already widely practiced and
   areas where there are opportunities for practicing agroforestry on a
   larger area and introducing novel practices. In addition, with this
   method it is possible to make more precise estimates on the extent of
   agroforestry in Europe and changes over time. Because agroforestry
   covers a considerable part of the agricultural land in the EU, it is
   crucial that it gets a more prominent and clearer place in EU
   statistical reporting in order to provide decision makers with more
   reliable information on the extent and nature of agroforestry. Reliable
   information, in turn, should help to guide policy development and
   implementation, and the evaluation of the impact of agricultural and
   other policies on agroforestry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring and mapping species diversity using indicators can allow the
   detection of changes in communities. Conclusions regarding these changes
   greatly depend on the choice of indicator. Here, we propose a new
   metric, the distance biochange index (D-BCI), that enables the
   characterization and quantification of both the level and direction of
   change in biological communities relative to a given reference state.
   The proposed metric uses conditional probabilities to assess the
   probability of observing a complete change in a given community and can
   be decomposed into four conditional probabilities of change: no change,
   complete change in species composition only, complete change in species
   richness only, and complete change in both species composition and
   richness. In this study, we compared the properties of D-BCI and BCI, a
   similarity version of D-BCI, with those of other widely used indices. We
   also proposed a new approach, based on the use of partial derivatives,
   to assess the sensitivity of six similarity indices over a wide range of
   contrasting scenarios of change. Finally, we extended the application of
   D-BCI to a simulated case study of the predicted evolution of suitable
   habitats for 20 species under climate change. Results from this
   simulation demonstrated that D-BCI provides an accurate assessment of
   the level and direction of change. Results also show that D-BCI can be
   used to reflect the effect of ecological gradients on species
   composition and species richness in biological communities.}},

Abstract = {{Floodplain forest of the Upper Mississippi River is important for
   songbirds during spring migration. However, the altered hydrology of
   this system and spread of reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and
   emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) threaten tree diversity and
   long-term sustainability of this forest. We estimated tree preferences
   of songbirds during spring migration 2010-2013 to help guide management
   decisions that promote tree diversity and forest sustainability and to
   evaluate yearly variation in tree selection. We used the point
   center-quarter method to assess relative availability of tree species
   and tallied bird foraging observations on tree species as well as
   recording the phenophase of used trees on five 40 ha plots of contiguous
   floodplain forest between La Crosse, Wisconsin and New Albin, Iowa, from
   15 April through 1 June. We quantified bird preferences by comparing
   proportional use of tree species by each bird species to estimates of
   tree species availability for all 4 y and for each year separately.
   Species that breed locally preferred silver maple (Acer saccharinum),
   which is dominant in this forest. The common transient migrant species
   and the suite of 17 transient wood warbler species preferred hackberry
   (Celtis occidentalis) and oaks (Quercus spp.), which are limited to
   higher elevations on the floodplain. We observed earlier leaf
   development the warm springs of 2010 and 2012 and later leaf development
   the cold springs of 2011 and 2013. Yellow-rumped Warbler (Setophaga
   coronata), American Redstart (S. ruticilla), Warbling Vireo (Vireo
   gilvus) and Baltimore Oriole (Icterus galbula), and the suite of
   transient migrant wood warblers spread their foraging efforts among tree
   species in colder springs and were more selective in warmer springs. All
   three of the important tree species are not regenerating well on the UMR
   and widespread die-off of silver maple is possible in 50 y without large
   scale management.}},

Abstract = {{Through their unique combination of specimen collections, scientific and
   public education expertise, and wide audience reach and trust, natural
   history museums (NHMs) are obvious settings for bridging conservation
   science and education through citizen science. Building on over 100
   years of amateur naturalist contributions to bio-diversity science, a
   wide range of NHM-based citizen science programs have emerged recently.
   Yet no comparative studies of the conservation outcomes of this work
   exist. Here we ask; what is the evidence that NHM citizen science
   contributes to conservation, what kinds of programs and strategies do
   so, and how could this approach be better realized for conservation
   goals? We analyzed 44 citizen science programs across three museums (one
   U.K., two U.S.) to assess whether and how they contribute to
   conservation-relevant outcomes. We found evidence that they support
   conservation both directly, through site and species management, and
   indirectly through research, education and policy impacts. This study
   has implications for understanding the role NHMs can play in maximizing
   the socio-ecological impacts of citizen science, including bringing
   citizen science to new audiences, mobilizing volunteers to collect and
   analyze data to study species invasions and impacts of global changes,
   and conducting locally-relevant research in urban systems. NHM citizen
   science can provide multiple entry-points and levels of engagement for
   participants in science and access to new means of studying
   bio-diversity, both in the field and virtually. From our findings we
   recommend collaboration among the research and education staff within
   NHMs and other similar conservation organizations, as well as
   partnerships with external organizations to successfully contribute to
   conservation outcomes. (c) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Complex adaptive systems provide a unified framework for explaining

   development of new techniques for coupling ecological and evolutionary
   dynamics, for integrating dynamics across multiple scales of
   organization, and for using data to infer the complex interactions among
   different components of ecological systems. Focusing on the development
   and usage of these new methods, we discuss how they have led to an
   improved understanding of three universal features of complex adaptive
   systems, emergent patterns; tipping points and critical phenomena; and
   cooperative behavior. We restrict our attention primarily to marine
   ecosystems, which provide numerous successful examples of the
   application of complex adaptive systems. Many of these are currently
   undergoing dramatic changes due to anthropogenic perturbations, and we
   take the opportunity to discuss how complex adaptive systems can be used

Abstract = {{Irregularly shaped trees including trees with buttresses, flutes or
   stilt roots are frequent in tropical forests. The lack of an
   international standard to measure the diameter of such trees leads to
   high uncertainties in biomass estimation, tree growth and carbon budget
   monitoring. In this study, we developed a new method based on
   terrestrial close-range photogrammetry for measuring and modelling
   irregular stems. This approach is cheap and easy to implement in the
   field as it only requires a camera and a graduated rod. We validated the
   approach with destructive cross-section measurements along the stem of
   three buttressed trees. To demonstrate the broader utility of this
   method, we extended the validated approach to 43 additional trees
   belonging to two species: Celtis mildbraedii (Ulmaceae) and
   Entandophragma cylindricum (Meliaceae). Based on the three dimensional
   models, we computed shape indices for each tree, and we analysed the
   stem morphology of the two species. Finally, we analysed some
   standardized predictors for the estimation of above-ground biomass. We
   found a high concordance between diameters derived from the
   photogrammetric process and destructive diameter measurements along the
   stem for the three calibration trees. We found that C.mildbraedii
   develop much stronger irregularities than E.cylindricum. We also
   identified a large intraspecific variation in trunk morphology for
   E.cylindricum. The basal area at 13m height (D-area130) seems to be a
   more robust predictor for biomass estimates (lowest Akaike information
   criterion and relative squared error) than diameter measured above
   buttresses (DAB) or diameter at breast height estimated from available
   taper model. Finally, D-area130 might be estimated with a good precision
   {[}root mean square error (RMSE)<5\%] with linear model based on the
   field measurements DAB and the perimeter of the convex hull of the
   buttresses at 13m height (D-convhull130). In this study, we showed the
   high potential of the photogrammetry for measuring and modelling
   irregular stems. Photogrammetry could then be used as a non-destructive
   measurement tool to produce correction factors for standardizing the
   diameter of irregular stems at a reference height which is a key issue
   in tree growth monitoring and biomass change estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental evolution is a powerful approach to study the process of
   adaptation to new environments, including the colonization of eukaryotic
   hosts. Facultative endosymbionts, including pathogens and mutualists,
   face changing and spatially structured environments during the symbiotic
   process, which impose diverse selection pressures. Here, we provide
   evidence that different selection regimes, involving different times
   spent in the plant environment, can result in either intra- or
   extracellular symbiotic adaptations. In previous work, we introduced the
   symbiotic plasmid of Cupriavidus taiwanensis, the rhizobial symbiont of
   Mimosa pudica, into the phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum and
   selected three variants able to form root nodules on M.pudica, two
   (CBM212 and CBM349) being able to rudimentarily infect nodule cells and
   the third one (CBM356) only capable of extracellular infection of
   nodules. Each nodulating ancestor was further challenged to evolve using
   serial ex planta-in planta cycles of either 21 (three short-cycle
   lineages) or 42days (three long-cycle lineages). In this study, we
   compared the phenotype of the 18 final evolved clones. Evolution through
   short and long cycles resulted in similar adaptive paths on lineages
   deriving from the two intracellularly infectious ancestors, CBM212 and
   CBM349. In contrast, only short cycles allowed a stable acquisition of
   intracellular infection in lineages deriving from the extracellularly
   infecting ancestor, CBM356. Long cycles, instead, favoured improvement
   of extracellular infection. Our work highlights the importance of the
   selection regime in shaping desired traits during host-mediated

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that the response of bacterial communities
   to disturbances depends on their environmental history. Historically
   fluctuating habitats host communities that respond better to disturbance
   than communities of historically stable habitats. However, the exact
   ecological mechanism that drives this dependency remains unknown. Here,
   we experimentally demonstrate that modifications of niche optima and
   niche breadths of the community members are driving this dependency of
   bacterial responses to past environmental conditions. First, we develop
   a novel, simple method to calculate the niche optima and breadths of
   bacterial taxa regarding single environmental gradients. Then, we test
   this method on sediment bacterial communities of three habitats, one
   historically stable and less loaded and two historically more variable
   and more loaded habitats in terms of historical chlorophyll- water
   concentration, that we subject to hypoxia via organic matter addition ex
   situ. We find that communities containing bacterial taxa differently
   adapted to hypoxia show different structural and functional responses,
   depending on the sediment's environmental history. Specifically, in the
   historically less fluctuating and loaded sediments where we find more
   taxa poorly adapted to hypoxic conditions, communities change a lot over
   time and organic matter is not degraded efficiently. The opposite is
   true for the historically more fluctuating and loaded sediments where we
   find more taxa well adapted to hypoxia. Based on the community responses
   observed here, we also propose an alternative calculation of community
   resistance that takes into account how rapidly the communities respond
   to disturbances and not just the initial and final states of the
   community.}},

Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{286-296}},

Abstract = {{Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the indicator commonly used to measure
   economic growth and sustainable development. However,this indicator can
   be very inefficient for evaluating development. The most prominent
   alternative indicator is the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare
   (ISEW). Indeed, this index can be used to control for the way that
   countries use available resources, balancing ecological development,
   damages caused to the environment and income distribution between
   citizens. This paper compares a sustainable development approach, using
   the ISEW, with the traditional economic growth approach using GDP, and
   its relationship with energy consumption. The traditional hypotheses of
   the energy-growth nexus are tested through Panel-Corrected Standard
   Errors estimators, for a panel constituted by twenty European countries,
   with an annual data frequency for the time span 1995-2014. The results
   indicate a new negative feedback hypothesis for the alternative measure
   of development and a conservative hypothesis for economic growth with
   energy consumption. This study also finds various other effects on
   sustainable development by economic growth factors, such as
   Terms-of-trade and Rents from natural resources. These findings indicate
   that the economic growth approach, widely studied using GDP, has been
   wrongly interpreted by policy makers trying to achieve increased
   sustainable development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There are global calls for new ecosystem-based fisheries management
   (EBFM) approaches. Scientific support for EBFM includes assessing
   ecosystem indicators of biological communities, environmental
   conditions, and human activities. As part of a broader research project
   we have synthesized a suite of traditional and new indicators for the
   Grand Bank in Atlantic Canada, which we share here. This is an ideal
   ecosystem for indicator analysis because it experienced dramatic changes
   over the past three decades, including a collapse in fish biomass that
   had profound socio-economic consequences. We exploit the wealth of data
   for this ecosystem to investigate how individual indicators reflect
   observed changes in the ecosystem, and then illustrate two applications
   of this indicator suite. Correlations were used to show that
   relationships among the fish functional groups changed after the
   collapse, and that a subset of indicators is sufficient to characterize
   each ecosystem category. Lagged correlations highlighted how changes in
   the drivers and pressures are often not immediately manifest in the fish
   community structure. We also organized indicators into the DPSIR
   (driver-pressure-state-impact-response) management framework. This
   exercise illustrated that indicator categorization is contextual and not
   straightforward, and we advocate for use of simpler categories that
   clearly show what is actionable. Additional future analyses that can be
   performed with our newly published suite of indicators are recommended.

   found to be predictive of plant distribution. Hydrologic thresholds for
   the three community groups were based on inundation period: Short (< 71
   days), Medium (ae<yen> 71 days but < 209 days), and Long (ae<yen> 209
   days). The distribution of plant assemblages was strongly correlated
   with key hydrologic gradients. Quantification of such relationships will
   be useful in forecasting ecohydrological responses of vernal pool
   vegetation to climate change, helping to guide future monitoring,
   management and restoration efforts for these unique ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Anurans are very mysterious fauna of animal kingdom. The current study
   represents the preliminary checklist of frogs and toads of Polo forest,

   stray notes and checklist prepared before almost two decades hence there
   are vital chances in the change in species composition with respect to
   lesser-known fauna like amphibians. The area was surveyed by line and
   strip transects as well as visual encounter and sono-taxonomical methods
   in order to record the presence of anuran species. The study shows ten
   species of anurans belonging to four families; among which two are newly
   recorded species in this area. The study can be an initiation to arrange
   baseline data regarding anuran's checklist, which can be extended to all
   the herpetofauna and other diversity too. Taxonomy of unidentified

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1016-1025}},

Abstract = {{Demographic analysis can elucidate how driving factors, such as climate
   or species interactions, affect populations. One important question is
   how growth would respond to future changes in the mean intensity of a
   driving factor or in its variability, such as might be expected in a
   fluctuating and shifting climate. Here I develop an approach to
   computing new stochastic elasticities to address this question. The
   linchpin of this novel approach is the multidimensional demographic
   difference that expresses how a population responds to change in the
   driving factor between two discrete levels of intensity. I use this
   difference to design a perturbation matrix that links data from common
   empirical sampling schemes with rigorous theory for stochastic
   elasticities. Although the starting point is a difference, the products
   of this synthesis are true derivatives: they are elasticity with respect
   to the mean intensity of a driving factor, and elasticity with respect
   to variability in a driving factor. Applying the methods to published
   data, I demonstrate how these new elasticities can shed light on growth
   rate response within and at the boundary of the previously observed
   range of the driving factor, thus helpfully indicating nonlinearity in
   the observed and in the potential future response. The stochastic
   approach simplifies in a fixed environment, yielding a compact formula
   for deterministic elasticity to a driving factor.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{1. Conservation practices in Europe frequently attempt to perpetuate or
   mimic the `traditional' forms of management of semi-natural habitats,
   but with a limited understanding of what these entailed.
   2. We review the emerging understanding of ecological processes,
   structures and management interventions that enhance biodiversity
   (wildlife) at diverse scales. These are then examined in the context of
   pre-industrial (c. 1200-1750) land management systems in lowland
   England, in order to identify historic practices which are likely to
   have provided important wildlife resources, but which are relatively
   neglected in current conservation management.
   3. Principles enhancing alpha and beta diversity and the conservation
   status of threatened species include structural complexity and
   heterogeneity at nested spatial scales; physical disturbance and
   exposure of mineral substrate; nutrient removal; lengthened successional
   rotations; and spatial variation in grazing regimes.
   4. The available evidence suggests that pre-industrial land management
   was generally characterized by intense resource exploitation and
   significant levels of biomass harvest; complex nested structural
   heterogeneity both between and within landscape elements; overlaying of
   multiple land uses; and spatial and temporal variability in management,
   rendering the concept of long-lived `traditional' practice problematic.
   Grazing patterns are poorly understood, but intensive grazing was
   probably the norm in most contexts, potentially resulting in simplified
   sward structures and suppressed ecotonal vegetation.
   5. In much of the pre-industrial period, early-successional and
   disturbed microhabitats were widespread, but ungrazed or lightly grazed
   herb-rich vegetation may have been limited, the converse of current
   conservation management. The key change since then has been
   homogenization at multiple scales, coupled with reduction of specific
   niches and conditions.
   6. Synthesis and applications. In adopting perceived `traditional'
   management practices, modern conservation rarely achieves the range and
   complexity of conditions that were present in the past. A better
   understanding of past practices allows more favourable management of
   those surviving semi-natural habitats where historic assemblages persist
   - with greater emphasis on physical disturbance and variability in
   prescriptions both temporally and spatially. When creating or restoring
   habitats, after interruption of management sufficiently long for
   dependent assemblages to be lost, better appreciation of historic
   management encourages novel forms of intervention to enhance
   biodiversity, with emphasis on complex structural and spatial
   heterogeneity at nested scales, biomass removal and nutrient reduction.
   These strongly management-based approaches are complementary to the use
   of large herbivores to create and maintain dynamic ecotonal mosaics in
   the manner advocated by some proponents of `rewilding'.}},

Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{508-531}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The recent emergence of powerful genomic tools, such as high-throughput
   genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics, combined with the study of
   gnotobiotic animals, have revealed overwhelming impacts of gut
   microbiota on the host phenotype. In addition to provide their host with
   metabolic functions that are not encoded in its own genome, evidence is
   accumulating that gut symbionts affect host traits previously thought to
   be solely under host genetic control, such as development and behavior.
   Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics studies further revealed that gut
   microbial communities can rapidly respond to changes in host diet or
   environmental conditions through changes in their structural and
   functional profiles, thus representing an important source of metabolic
   flexibility and phenotypic plasticity for the host. Hence, gut microbes
   appear to be an important factor affecting host ecology and evolution
   which is, however, not accounted for in life-history theory, or in
   classic population genetics, ecological and eco-evolutionary models. In
   this forum, we shed new light on life history and eco-evolutionary
   dynamics by viewing these processes through the lens of host-microbiota
   interactions. We follow a three-level approach. First, current knowledge
   on the role of gut microbiota in host physiology and behavior points out
   that gut symbionts can be a crucial medium of life-history strategies.
   Second, the particularity of the microbiota is based on its multilayered
   structure, composed of both a core microbiota, under host genetic and
   immune control, and a flexible pool of microbes modulated by the
   environment, which differ in constraints on their maintenance and in
   their contribution to host adaptation. Finally, gut symbionts can drive
   the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of their host through effects
   on individual, population, community and ecosystem levels. In
   conclusion, we highlight some future perspectives for integrative
   studies to test hypotheses on life history and eco-evolutionary dynamics
   in light of the gut microbiota.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{376-384}},

Abstract = {{Introducing a new or extirpated species to an ecosystem is risky, and
   managers need quantitative methods that can predict the consequences for
   the recipient ecosystem. Proponents of keystone predator reintroductions
   commonly argue that the presence of the predator will restore ecosystem
   function, but this has not always been the case, and mathematical
   modeling has an important role to play in predicting how reintroductions
   will likely play out. We devised an ensemble modeling method that
   integrates species interaction networks and dynamic community
   simulations and used it to describe the range of plausible consequences
   of 2 keystone-predator reintroductions: wolves (Canis lupus) to
   Yellowstone National Park and dingoes (Canis dingo) to a national park
   in Australia. Although previous methods for predicting ecosystem
   responses to such interventions focused on predicting changes around a
   given equilibrium, we used Lotka-Volterra equations to predict changing
   abundances through time. We applied our method to interaction networks
   for wolves in Yellowstone National Park and for dingoes in Australia.
   Our model replicated the observed dynamics in Yellowstone National Park
   and produced a larger range of potential outcomes for the dingo network.
   However, we also found that changes in small vertebrates or
   invertebrates gave a good indication about the potential future state of
   the system. Our method allowed us to predict when the systems were far
   from equilibrium. Our results showed that the method can also be used to
   predict which species may increase or decrease following a
   reintroduction and can identify species that are important to monitor
   (i.e., species whose changes in abundance give extra insight into broad
   changes in the system). Ensemble ecosystem modeling can also be applied
   to assess the ecosystem-wide implications of other types of
   interventions including assisted migration, biocontrol, and invasive
   species eradication.}},

Abstract = {{Our society faces a dilemma. While continued economic growth is
   ecologically unsustainable, low or negative rates of economic growth are
   accompanied by adverse social impacts. Hence there is a need for
   macroeconomic tools that can help identify socially sustainable
   post-growth pathways. The emerging field of ecological macroeconomics
   aims to address this need and features a number of new macroeconomic
   modelling approaches. This article provides (1) a review of modelling
   developments in ecological macroeconomics, based on the literature and
   interviews with researchers, and (2) an analysis of how the different
   models incorporate policy themes from the post-growth literature.
   Twenty-two ecological macroeconomic models were analysed and compared to
   eight policy themes. It was found that environmental interactions and
   the monetary system were treated most comprehensively. Themes of income
   inequality, work patterns, indicators of well-being, and disaggregated
   production were addressed with less detail, while alternative business
   models and cross-scale interactions were hardly addressed. Overall, the
   combination of input-output analysis with stock-flow consistent
   modelling was identified as a promising avenue for developing
   macroeconomic models for a post-growth economy. However, due to the wide
   interpretation of what ``the economy{''} entails, future research will
   benefit from employing a range of approaches.(C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Plant defence often varies by orders of magnitude as plants develop from
   the seedling to juvenile to mature and senescent stages. Ontogenetic
   trajectories can involve switches among defence traits, leading to
   complex shifting phenotypes across plant lifetimes. While considerable
   research has characterised ontogenetic trajectories for now hundreds of
   plant species, we still lack a clear understanding of the molecular,
   ecological and evolutionary factors driving these patterns. In this
   study, we identify several non-mutually exclusive factors that may have
   led to the evolution of ontogenetic trajectories in plant defence,
   including developmental constraints, resource allocation costs,
   multi-functionality of defence traits, and herbivore selection pressure.
   Evidence from recent physiological studies is highlighted to shed light
   on the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation and
   activation of these developmental changes. Overall, our goal is to
   promote new research avenues that would provide evidence for the factors
   that have promoted the evolution of this complex lifetime phenotype.
   Future research focusing on the questions and approaches identified here

Title = {{Identification of animal movement patterns using tri-axial magnetometry}},
Journal = {{MOVEMENT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Accelerometers are powerful sensors in many bio-logging
   devices, and are increasingly allowing researchers to investigate the
   performance, behaviour, energy expenditure and even state, of free-
   living animals. Another sensor commonly used in animal-attached loggers
   is the magnetometer, which has been primarily used in dead-reckoning or
   inertial measurement tags, but little outside that. We examine the
   potential of magnetometers for helping elucidate the behaviour of
   animals in a manner analogous to, but very different from,
   accelerometers. The particular responses of magnetometers to movement
   means that there are instances when they can resolve behaviours that are
   not easily perceived using accelerometers.
   Methods: We calibrated the tri-axial magnetometer to rotations in each
   axis of movement and constructed 3dimensional plots to inspect these
   stylised movements. Using the tri-axial data of Daily Diary tags,
   attached to individuals of number of animal species as they perform
   different behaviours, we used these 3-d plots to develop a framework
   with which tri-axial magnetometry data can be examined and introduce
   metrics that should help quantify movement and behaviour.
   Results: Tri-axial magnetometry data reveal patterns in movement at
   various scales of rotation that are not always evident in acceleration
   data. Some of these patterns may be obscure until visualised in 3D space
   as tri-axial spherical plots (m-spheres). A tag-fitted animal that
   rotates in heading while adopting a constant body attitude produces a
   ring of data around the pole of the m-sphere that we define as its
   Normal Operational Plane (NOP). Data that do not lie on this ring are
   created by postural rotations of the animal as it pitches and/or rolls.
   Consequently, stereotyped behaviours appear as specific trajectories on
   the sphere (m-prints), reflecting conserved sequences of postural
   changes (and/or angular velocities), which result from the precise
   relationship between body attitude and heading. This novel approach
   shows promise for helping researchers to identify and quantify
   behaviours in terms of animal body posture, including heading.
   Conclusion: Magnetometer-based techniques and metrics can enhance our
   capacity to identify and examine animal behaviour, either as a technique
   used alone, or one that is complementary to tri-axial accelerometry.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},

Volume = {{348}},
Pages = {{44-55}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Natural grassland communities are threatened by a variety of factors,
   such as climate change and increasing land use by mankind. The use of
   plant protection products (synthetic or organic) is mandatory in
   agricultural food production. To avoid adverse effects on natural
   grasslands within agricultural areas, synthetic plant protection
   products are strictly regulated in Europe. However, effects of
   herbicides on non-target terrestrial plants are primarily studied on the
   level of individual plants neglecting interactions between species.
   In our study, we aim to extrapolate individual-level effects to the
   population and community level by adapting an existing spatio-temporal,
   individual-based plant community model (IBC-grass). We analyse the
   effects of herbicide exposure for three different grassland communities:
   1) representative field boundary community, 2) Calthion grassland
   community, and 3) Arrhenatheretalia grassland community. Our simulations
   show that herbicide depositions can have effects on non-target plant
   communities resulting from direct and indirect effects on population
   level. The effect extent depends not only on the distance to the field,
   but also on the specific plant community, its disturbance regime
   (cutting frequency, trampling and grazing intensity) and resource level.
   Mechanistic modelling approaches such as IBC-grass present a promising
   novel approach in transferring and extrapolating standardized pot
   experiments to community level and thereby bridging the gap between
   ecotoxicological testing (e.g. in the greenhouse) and protection goals

Abstract = {{Estuarine environments support dynamic phytoplankton blooms, especially
   in lowlatitude regions, where the effects of local drivers dominate.
   Identifying key bloom drivers from entangled ecological and
   anthropogenic influences is particularly challenging in stressed systems
   where several disturbances interact. Additionally, processes controlling
   bloom and non-bloom phytoplankton biomass dynamics can differ spatially,
   further confounding characterization of disturbance regimes that create
   bloom-favorable conditions. This study aims to explore the question of
   whether the shift from non-bloom to bloom conditions is matched by a
   shift in the relative importance of water quality drivers. Florida Bay
   (USA), a shallow subtropical inner shelf lagoon, was chosen as the study
   site due to its unique bloom dynamics and low-latitude location, as well
   as for the availability of long-term (16 yr) water quality data
   consisting of monthly measurements from 28 locations across the 2200
   km(2) bay. At each of the locations, we applied a novel thresholdbased
   quantile regression analysis to chlorophyll a data to define bloom
   conditions, separate data from non-bloom conditions, and evaluate
   phytoplankton biomass dynamics of each of the 2 states. The final suite
   of explanatory covariates revealed spatial trends and differences in the
   relative importance of water quality descriptors of phytoplankton
   between the 2 conditions. The effects of turbidity and salinity on
   phytoplankton biomass became pronounced during blooms, whereas non-bloom
   conditions were primarily explained by autoregressive phytoplankton
   biomass trends and nutrient dynamics. The proposed analytical approach
   is not limited to any particular aquatic system type, and can be used to
   produce practical spatiotemporal information to guide management,
   restoration, and conservation efforts.}},

   The hysteresis for the relationships between rate of bedload transport
   and water discharges were identified showing that for both creeks for
   the higher water levels a figure of eight loop may be easily recognized.
   Moreover, a new method for the calculation of bedload transport rate,

Title = {{Biological responses of sharks to ocean acidification}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Sharks play a key role in the structure of marine food webs, but are
   facing major threats due to overfishing and habitat degradation.
   Although sharks are also assumed to be at relatively high risk from
   climate change due to a low intrinsic rate of population growth and slow
   rates of evolution, ocean acidification (OA) has not, until recently,
   been considered a direct threat. New studies have been evaluating the
   potential effects of end-of-century elevated CO2 levels on sharks and
   their relatives' early development, physiology and behaviour. Here, we
   review those findings and use a meta-analysis approach to quantify the
   overall direction and magnitude of biological responses to OA in the
   species of sharks that have been investigated to date. While embryo
   survival and development time are mostly unaffected by elevated CO2,
   there are clear effects on body condition, growth, aerobic potential and
   behaviour (e.g. lateralization, hunting and prey detection).
   Furthermore, studies to date suggest that the effects of OA could be as
   substantial as those due to warming in some species. A major limitation
   is that all past studies have involved relatively sedentary, benthic
   sharks that are capable of buccal ventilation-no studies have
   investigated pelagic sharks that depend on ram ventilation. Future
   research should focus on species with different life strategies (e.g.
   pelagic, ram ventilators), climate zones (e.g. polar regions), habitats
   (e.g. open ocean), and distinct phases of ontogeny in order to fully
   predict how OA and climate change will impact higher-order predators and
   therefore marine ecosystem dynamics.}},

   Analytical framework and case studies in the United States}},
Journal = {{ECOHYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{More than 50\% of water supplies in the conterminous United States
   originate on forestland or rangeland and are potentially under
   increasing stress as a result of larger and more severe wildfires.
   Little is known, however, about the long-term impacts of fire on annual
   water yield and the role of climate variability within this context. We
   here propose a framework for evaluating wildland fire impacts on
   streamflow that combines double-mass analysis with new methods (change
   point analysis, climate elasticity modeling, and process-based modeling)
   to distinguish between multiyear fire and climate impacts. The framework
   captures a wide range of fire types, watersheds characteristics, and
   climate conditions using streamflow data, as opposed to other approaches
   requiring paired watersheds. The process is illustrated with three case
   studies. A watershed in Arizona experienced a +266\% increase in annual
   water yield in the 5years after a wildfire, where +219\% was attributed
   to wildfire and +24\% to precipitation trends. In contrast, a California
   watershed had a lower (-64\%) post-fire net water yield, comprised of
   enhanced flow (+38\%) attributed to wildfire offset (-102\%) by lower
   precipitation in the post-fire period. Changes in streamflow within a
   watershed in South Carolina had no apparent link to periods of
   prescribed burning but matched a very wet winter and reports of storm
   damage. The presented framework is unique in its ability to detect and
   quantify fire or other disturbances, even if the date or nature of the
   disturbance event is uncertain, and regardless of precipitation trends.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{343-356}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Metrics of epiphyte load on macrophytes were evaluated for use as
   quantitative biological indicators for nutrient impacts in estuarine
   waters, based on review and analysis of the literature on epiphytes and
   macrophytes, primarily seagrasses, but including some brackish and
   freshwater rooted macrophyte species. An approach is presented that
   empirically derives threshold epiphyte loads which are likely to cause
   specified levels of decrease in macrophyte response metrics such as
   biomass, shoot density, percent cover, production and growth. Data from
   36 studies of 10 macrophyte species were pooled to derive relationships
   between epiphyte load and.25 and 50\% seagrass response levels, which
   are proposed as the primary basis for establishment of critical
   threshold values. Given multiple sources of variability in the response
   data, threshold ranges based on the range of values falling between the
   median and the 75th quantiles of observations at a given seagrass
   response level are proposed rather than single, critical point values.
   Four epiphyte load threshold categories low, moderate, high, very high,
   are proposed. Comparison of values of epiphyte loads associated with 25
   and 50\% reductions in light to macrophytes suggest that the threshold
   ranges are realistic both in terms of the principle mechanism of impact
   to macrophytes and in terms of the magnitude of resultant impacts
   expressed by the macrophytes. Some variability in response levels was
   observed among climate regions, and additional data collected with a
   standardized approach could help in the development of regionalized
   threshold ranges for the epiphyte load indicator. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{500-515}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, China has been gradually consolidating the
   establishment of Low Carbon Communities (LCC) to minimize the emission
   of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses. Guangdong Province, as one of the
   low-carbon pilot provinces, has also paid great attention to the
   building of LCC. However, currently Guangdong province, or even China as
   a whole, has no official evaluation system in place which can be
   employed to evaluate the degree of low carbon of urban LCC. This paper
   aimed to establish a system for evaluating the urban LCC of Guangdong
   Province based on their actual situations. The system divided the
   evaluation into six categories, applied the SMART criteria to select
   suitable indices, and set the reference values for two zones, i.e., the
   Pearl River Delta zone (PRD) and the non-PRD zone. Monte Carlo and AHP
   were combined for the calculation of index weights, thus ensuring that
   the weight judgment matrixes could all pass the consistency check. In
   addition, this paper also laid down detailed evaluation regulations to
   improve the operability of this system and guarantee its wide
   application and better generalization. Finally, one typical urban
   community was selected to test the operability of this system, and the
   One At -a-Time (OAT) method was used to analyze the sensitivity of each
   index and explore the degree of influence of these indices on evaluation
   results. The results showed that three indicators corresponding to green
   building percentage, new energy vehicles percentage and low carbon
   public transportation had the highest sensitivity. After field test
   evaluation, the evaluation system was found to have strong operability,
   and a high accessibility to indicator data. This system cannot only be
   used as a tool by the Provincial People's Government of Guangdong to
   evaluate the construction progress and degree of low carbon in LCC, but
   can also provide a reference point and experience for the Chinese
   government to draw upon in establishing the evaluation system of LCC at
   a national level. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Balancing generality and specificity in ecological gradient analysis

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{318-332}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Aim Data on ecological communities are often condensed into
   single-valued diversity indices, which support comparisons among
   ecosystems but may discard important information. At the other extreme,
   some studies retain full data on the identities of all species present,
   which retains maximum information on community structure but occludes
   comparisons among ecosystems. We sought to determine whether the
   analysis of species abundance distributions and individual size
   distributions could support more detailed inferences than diversity
   indices while remaining sufficiently general to identify fundamental
   ecological responses in multiple ecosystems.
   Location The United States and south-eastern Australia.
   Methods We analysed changes in species abundance distributions and
   individual size distributions along environmental gradients. We compared
   analyses of distributions with analyses of five diversity indices and
   with a distance-based multivariate analysis of species composition. We
   used data from 1438 fish communities in the United States and from 840
   bird communities in the western United States and south-eastern
   Australia. These communities were sampled over 10-20 years and included
   298 species of birds and 488 species of fishes.
   Results Analyses of species abundance distributions and individual size
   distributions identified environmental associations that were not found
   in analyses of diversity indices, and revealed common associations with
   shrubs in bird communities on different continents and with temperature
   in communities of birds and fishes. Individual size distributions were
   associated more closely with environmental variables than were species
   abundance distributions.
   Main conclusions Our novel identification of ecological associations
   suggests that analyses of community distributions might reveal
   fundamental ecological processes common to multiple ecosystems. Close
   associations between individual sizes and environmental variables
   suggest that a greater focus on size in ecological analyses might assist
   in the development of general models of ecological communities.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological opportunity is often regarded as a key factor that explains
   why diversity is unevenly distributed across life. Colonization of novel
   environments or adaptive zones may promote diversification. North
   American minnows exhibit an ancestral benthic-to-pelagic habitat shift
   that coincided with a burst in diversification. Here, we evaluate the
   phenotypic and ecological implications of this habitat shift by
   assessing craniofacial and dietary traits among 34 species and testing
   for morphology-diet covariation, convergence and adaptive optima. There
   were several instances of morphology-diet covariation such as
   correlations between mouth angle and the consumption of terrestrial
   insects and between relative gut length and the consumption of algae.
   After accounting for size and phylogenetic nonindependence, benthic
   species had longer heads, longer snouts, eyes positioned higher on their
   head, smaller mouth angles and longer digestive tracts than pelagic
   minnows. Benthic minnows also consumed more algae but less terrestrial
   insects, by volume, than pelagic minnows. Lastly, there were three
   distinct evolutionary regimes and more convergence in morphology and
   dietary characteristics than expected under a Brownian motion model of
   evolution. These findings indicate that colonization of the pelagic zone
   by minnows involved myriad phenotypic and dietary changes associated
   with exploitation of terrestrial subsidies. Thus, minnows exhibit
   phenotype-dietary covariation, an expansion of ecological roles and a
   burst in diversification rates in response to the ecological opportunity
   afforded by the colonization of a novel habitat.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{New models are required to predict the impacts of future climate change
   on biodiversity. A move must be made away from individual models of
   single species toward approaches with synergistically interacting
   species. The focus should be on indirect effects due to biotic
   interactions. Here we propose a new parsimonious approach to simulate
   direct and indirect effects of global warming on plant communities. The
   methodology consists of five steps: a) field survey of species
   abundances, b) quantitative assessment of species co-occurrences, c)
   assignment of a theorised effect of increased temperature on each
   species, d) creation of a community model to project community dynamics,
   and e) exploration of the potential range of temperature change effects
   on plant communities.
   We explored the possible climate-driven dynamics in an alpine vegetation
   community and gained insights into the role of biotic interactions as
   determinants of plant species response to climate change at local scale.
   The study area was the uppermost portion of Alpe delle Tre Potenze
   (Northern Apennines, Italy) from 1500 m up to the summit at 1940 m.
   Our work shows that: 1) unexpected climate-driven dynamics can emerge,
   2) interactive communities with indirect effects among species can
   overcome direct effects induced by global warming; 3) if just one or few
   species react to global warming the new community configuration could be
   unexpected and counter-intuitive; 4) timing of species reactions to
   global warming is an important driver of community dynamics; 5) using
   simulation models with a limited amount of data in input, it is possible
   to explore the full range of potential changes in plant communities

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{202-212}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Animals are embedded in dynamically changing networks of
   relationships with conspecifics. These dynamic networks are fundamental
   aspects of their environment, creating selection on behaviours and other
   traits. However, most social network-based approaches in ecology are
   constrained to considering networks as static, despite several calls for
   such analyses to become more dynamic.
   2. There are a number of statistical analyses developed in the social
   sciences that are increasingly being applied to animal networks, of
   which stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs) are a principal example.
   SAOMs are a class of individual-based models designed to model
   transitions in networks between discrete time points, as influenced by
   network structure and covariates. It is not clear, however, how useful
   such techniques are to ecologists, and whether they are suited to animal
   social networks.
   3. We review the recent applications of SAOMs to animal networks,
   outlining findings and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of SAOMs
   when applied to animal rather than human networks. We go on to highlight
   the types of ecological and evolutionary processes that SAOMs can be
   used to study.
   4. SAOMs can include effects and covariates for individuals, dyads and
   populations, which can be constant or variable. This allows for the
   examination of a wide range of questions of interest to ecologists.
   However, high-resolution data are required, meaning SAOMs will not be
   useable in all study systems. It remains unclear how robust SAOMs are to
   missing data and uncertainty around social relationships.
   5. Ultimately, we encourage the careful application of SAOMs in
   appropriate systems, with dynamic network analyses likely to prove
   highly informative. Researchers can then extend the basic method to
   tackle a range of existing questions in ecology and explore novel lines
   of questioning.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The Before-After Control-Impact Paired Series (BACIPS) design
   distinguishes natural spatial and temporal variability from variation
   induced by an environmental impact (or intervention) of interest. BACIPS
   is a powerful tool to derive inferences about interventions when classic
   experimental approaches (e.g. which rely on spatial replicates and
   random assignment of treatments) are not feasible or desirable.
   Previously applied BACIPS designs generally assume that effects are
   sudden, constant and long-lived: that is, that systems exhibit
   step-changes' in response to interventions. However, complex ecological
   interactions or gradual interventions may create delayed and/or
   progressive responses, potentially impeding the reliability of classic
   (step-change) analyses. We propose a novel approach, the
   Progressive-Change BACIPS, which generalizes and expands the scope of
   BACIPS analyses. We evaluate the relative performance of this approach
   using both simulated and real data that exhibit step-change, linear,
   asymptotic and sigmoid responses following an intervention. We quantify
   the statistical power and accuracy of the Progressive-Change BACIPS
   under varying initial population densities, intensity of spatial
   sampling, effect sizes and number of sampling dates After the
   intervention. We show that Progressive-Change BACIPS identified the
   correct model among the set of candidate models under most conditions
   and led to accurate estimates of the parameters that were used to
   generate the simulated data. When data were sparse, and the dynamics
   complex, simpler (more parsimonious) models were favoured over the more
   complex models that actually generated the simulated data. Application
   of the Progressive-Change BACIPS to existing data sets from the
   literature led to strong support for specific models (over alternatives)
   and led to more specific inferences than possible under the classic
   BACIPS approach. The Progressive-Change BACIPS proposed here is more
   flexible than the original BACIPS formulation because the data are used
   to inform the form of the final model, rather than having the form of
   the model imposed on the data. This leads to better estimates of the
   effects of environmental impacts and the time-scales over which they
   operate. As a result, the Progressive-Change BACIPS should be applicable
   to a wide range of studies and should help improve investigation of
   time-dependent effects. R code to perform Progressive-Change BACIPS
   analysis is provided.}},

   lands have adopted a variety of management practices to minimize
   conflicts and maximize benefits derived from multiple uses of public
   lands. However, even a few perceived negative recreationist experiences
   may prompt some public land agencies to remove livestock grazing
   entirely. California's grasslands-a large component of public lands-are
   the most ``at-risk{''} habitat type for development, and increasing
   economic and social pressures on ranchers who utilize leased public
   lands make it more likely that ranchers would sell their private lands
   to developers if access to public grazing land were eliminated, further
   increasing threats to our already dwindling rangelands. The continued
   accessibility of public lands for grazing is thus inextricably linked to
   the protection of private rangelands and the critical resources they
   provide. Novel approaches to public education and collaborative land
   management are critical to reducing negative livestock-recreation
   encounter and ensuring continued conservation of wildlands. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{Coral-reef fisheries pose a problem for traditional forms of management
   because stock assessments and demographic data are limited in diverse
   systems. We used catch records coupled with fisher interviews to derive
   hierarchical indicators of fishery status by (1) characterizing
   catch-and-effort trends with respect to environmental factors, (2)
   assessing the degree to which biomass-and-abundance distributions were
   coupled across trophic levels, and (3) identifying key characteristics
   of species-based landings that were sensitive to fishing pressure and
   linked with management guidance. Using data across one year from a
   representative Pacific Island fishery, we show that catch and effort
   were constrained by environments, as both were disproportionally highest
   during favorable new moon phases in spring, but more effort was required
   to catch fewer fish later in the year, and the size of target species
   declined. The magnitude of constrained catch success provided an initial
   indication of status that could be compared spatially and temporally.
   Second, biomass-and-abundance distributions were examined within
   dominant fish families. Large-bodied species contributed most to biomass
   in low trophic positions, but small-bodied counterparts were more
   abundant, following expected observations from systems with less human
   influence. However, biomass-and-abundance distributions became coupled
   for invertivores and predators, as small species and individuals were
   most represented. The shape and fit of regressions between asymptotic
   lengths and proportional landings identified drivers of coupled
   distributions. Polynomial fits highlighted that smaller-bodied species
   were main components of the fishery, while linear fits suggested that
   larger-bodied species were still dominant, and tolerant of current
   fishing pressure. Last, two indicators were used to identify management
   objectives for target fishes, skewness of size distributions and
   proportional contributions to landings. Significantly skewed size
   distributions existed for most target fishes, suggesting high density
   dependence and recruitment, and the potential for size-based polices to
   achieve desirable fishery objectives. Meanwhile, the diminished and
   constrained contribution of many large species indicated their
   vulnerability despite non-significant shifts in size. Catch quotas, gear
   limitations, or temporary restrictions may be more appropriate for
   sustaining these species. A framework is synthesized to interact with
   stake-holders and consider holistic management approaches for
   multispecies coral-reef fisheries.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Invasive species continue to pose major challenges for managing coupled
   human-environmental systems. Predictive tools are essential to maximize
   invasion monitoring and conservation efforts in regions reliant on
   abundant freshwater resources to sustain economic welfare, social
   equity, and ecological services. Past studies have revealed biotic and
   abiotic heterogeneity, along with human activity, can account for much
   of the spatial variability of aquatic invaders; however, improvements
   remain. This study was created to (1) examine the distribution of
   aquatic invasive species richness (AISR) across 126 lakes in the
   Adirondack Region of New York; (2) develop and compare global and local
   models between lake and landscape characteristics and AISR; and (3) use
   geographically weighted regression (GWR) to evaluate non-stationarity of
   local relationships, and assess its use for prioritizing lakes at risk
   to invasion. The evaluation index, AISR, was calculated by summing the
   following potential aquatic invaders for each lake: Asian Clam
   (Corbicula fluminea), Brittle Naiad (Najas minor), Curly-leaf Pondweed
   (Potamogeton crispus), Eurasian Watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum),
   European Frog-bit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae), Fanwort (Cabomba
   caroliniana), Spiny Waterflea (Bythotrephes longimanus), Variable-leaf
   Milfoil (Myriophyllum heterophyllum), Water Chestnut (Trapa natans),
   Yellow Floating Heart (Nymphoides peltata), and Zebra Mussel (Dreissena
   polymorpha). The Getis-Ord Gi{*} statistic displayed significant spatial
   hot and cold spots of AISR across Adirondack lakes. Spearman's rank
   (rho) correlation coefficient test (gamma(s)) revealed urban land cover
   composition, lake elevation, relative patch richness, and abundance of
   game fish were the strongest predictors of aquatic invasion. Five
   multiple regression global Poisson and GWR models were made, with GWR
   fitting AISR very well (R-2 = 76-83\%). Local pseudo-t-statistics of key
   explanatory variables were mapped and related to AISR, confirming the
   importance of GWR for understanding spatial relationships of invasion.
   The top 20 lakes at risk to future invasion were identified and ranked
   by summing the five GWR predictive estimates. The results inform that
   inexpensive and publicly accessible lake and landscape data, typically
   available from digital repositories within local environmental agencies,
   can be used to develop predictions of aquatic invasion with remarkable
   agreement. Ultimately, this transferable modeling approach can improve
   monitoring and management strategies for slowing the spread of invading
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological niche modeling has emerged as a notable tool in invasive
   species risk assessment. However, the advances of the ecological niche
   theory, the basis of ecological niche modeling, are not matched by
   availability of detailed biological data. Thus, we proposed a conceptual
   framework to refine the boundaries of ecological niche, differentiating
   the species' existence status (survival, growth, and reproduction) based
   on physiological limits of major life history characteristics. We
   discussed differences between the classic and the proposed frameworks
   and emphasized the importance of the time axis in understanding species'
   existence status. We exemplified the implementation potential of this
   framework by reviewing published studies of physiological limits
   (temperature and salinity) for survival, growth, and reproduction of
   invasive freshwater bivalves in USA. We found considerable amount of
   physiological information through the literature review, though there is
   a research bias toward more influential invasive species (vs. less
   influential invasive species), temperature tolerance (vs. salinity
   tolerance), and survival limits (vs. growth and reproduction limits);
   filling the knowledge gaps will strengthen the potential of the proposed
   framework. Our framework addresses the lack of long-term field data, but
   is limited in that one can only identify unsuitable instead of suitable
   conditions for species, given incomplete understanding of species'
   physiological tolerance. Future studies may consider developing new
   algorithms that utilize physiological limits as priors in a Bayesian

Abstract = {{Opiliones are iconic arachnids with a Palaeozoic origin and a diversity
   that reflects ancient biogeographic patterns dating back at least to the
   times of Pangea. Owing to interest in harvestman diversity, evolution
   and biogeography, their relationships have been thoroughly studied using
   morphology and PCR-based Sanger approaches to infer their systematic
   relationships. More recently, two studies utilized transcriptomics-based
   phylogenomics to explore their basal relationships and diversification,
   but sampling was limiting for understanding deep evolutionary patterns,
   as they lacked good taxon representation at the family level. Here, we
   analysed a set of the 14 existing transcriptomes with 40 additional ones
   generated for this study, representing approximately 80\% of the extant
   familial diversity in Opiliones. Our phylogenetic analyses, including a
   set of data matrices with different gene occupancy and evolutionary
   rates, and using a multitude of methods correcting for a diversity of
   factors affecting phylogenomic data matrices, provide a robust and
   stable Opiliones tree of life, where most families and higher taxa are
   precisely placed. Our dating analyses using alternative calibration
   points, methods and analytical parameters provide well-resolvedold
   divergences, consistent with ancient regionalization in Pangea in some
   groups, and Pangean vicariance in others. The integration of
   state-of-the-art molecular techniques and analyses, together with the
   broadest taxonomic sampling to date presented in a phylogenomic study of
   harvestmen, provide new insights into harvestmen interrelationships, as
   well as an overview of the general biogeographic patterns of this

Abstract = {{Deep reef assemblages in south-eastern Australia are poorly described,

   spatial scales. Here, we characterise the composition of deep(similar to
   30-90 m depth) sessile invertebrate communities from sub-tropical (27
   degrees S) to temperate eastern Australia (43 degrees S). We estimated
   the cover of 51 preselected invertebrate types from over 1700 seafloor
   images collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle from >105 km of
   transects across the study region. Seafloor images were assessed using 3
   alternative schemes reflecting different resolution of benthic
   invertebrate groupings, including the broadlevel Collaborative and
   Automated Tools for Analysis of Marine Imagery project ('CATAMI')
   classification recently developed as a generic scoring approach for
   seafloor imagery. Ordination using canonical analysis of principal
   coordinates indicated a clear latitudinal gradient in benthic community
   composition and, particularly when based on individual morphotypes, 3
   distinct community types (sub-tropical, warm temperate and cool
   temperate). Changes in community structure mostly correlated with
   primary productivity and the temperature climatology, while local-scale
   variability in community composition was most related to depth. Along
   with the gradual shift in deep reef community composition across
   latitudes, region-specific sessile invertebrates might serve as useful
   indicators of change in these deep benthic communities under future
   changes in ocean climate in the region, which has been identified as a
   global hotspot for ocean warming. Our methodological approach has
   general applicability for large-scale surveying and monitoring of

Abstract = {{Tracking of marine animals has increased exponentially in the past
   decade, and the resulting data could lead to an in-depth understanding
   of the causes and consequences of movement in the ocean. However, most
   common marine tracking systems are associated with large measurement
   errors. Accounting for these errors requires the use of hierarchical
   models, which are often difficult to fit to data. Using 3 case studies,
   we demonstrate that Template Model Builder (TMB), a new R package, is an
   accurate, efficient and flexible framework for modelling movement data.
   First, to demonstrate that TMB is as accurate but 30 times faster than
   bsam, a popular R package used to apply state-space models to Argos
   data, we modelled polar bear Ursus maritimus Argos data and compared the
   locations estimated by the models to GPS locations of these same bears.
   Second, to demonstrate how TMB's gain in efficiency and frequentist
   framework facilitate model comparison, we developed models with
   different error structures and compared them to find the most effective
   model for light-based geolocations of rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca
   monocerata. Finally, to maximize efficiency through TMB's use of the
   Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood, we modelled
   behavioural changes with continuous rather than discrete states. This
   new model directly accounts for the irregular sampling intervals
   characteristic of Fastloc-GPS data of grey seals Halichoerus grypus.
   Using real and simulated data, we show that TMB is a fast and powerful
   tool for modelling marine movement data. We discuss how TMB's potential
   reaches beyond marine movement studies.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a novel regional sustainability assessment framework
   for integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). Various ICZM indicators
   have been developed, but their management insights are not always clear.
   Our framework integrates three separately developed approaches with an
   explicit reflection of stakeholders' values: Satoumi (a Japanese concept
   of socio-ecological production landscapes, SEPLs), ecosystem services
   approach (ESA), and inclusive wealth (IW). We suggest that the
   integration of Satoumi, a uniquely Japanese concept, with the ESA and IW
   complements each other and increases the effectiveness of all three
   approaches when applied to ICZM and decision making. Satoumi describes
   the desired state of a coastal zone. The ESA translates Satoumi into IW
   and helps explain which changes to ecosystems contribute to the asset
   quality (i.e., shadow prices). As a sustainability indicator, IW differs
   from other ecological indicators because it comprises human, natural,
   and manufactured capital assets and incorporates shadow prices to weigh
   the contribution of each asset to the present value of social welfare.
   Shadow prices may capture the quality of capital assets in terms of how
   much people value them, and can therefore be a direct management target
   for realizing a desired coastal zone. We propose adding two
   sustainability criteria, desired state and strong sustainability, to the
   original IW to make it operational. The framework was tested in Japan's
   Seto Inland Sea, and the results were analyzed in depth. Based on the
   outcomes, we discuss the insights for ICZM and future research. While
   Satoumi is a Japanese concept, the framework could be applied to other
   countries where similar SEPLs exist. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Macroecology and biogeography are concerned with understanding
   biodiversity patterns across space and time. In the past, the two
   disciplines have addressed this question mainly with correlative
   approaches, despite frequent calls for more mechanistic explanations.
   Recent advances in computational power, theoretical understanding, and
   statistical tools are, however, currently facilitating the development
   of more system-oriented, mechanistic models. We review these models,
   identify different model types and theoretical frameworks, compare their
   processes and properties, and summarize emergent findings. We show that
   ecological (physiology, demographics, dispersal, biotic interactions)
   and evolutionary processes, as well as environmental and human-induced
   drivers, are increasingly modelled mechanistically; and that new
   insights into biodiversity dynamics emerge from these models. Yet,
   substantial challenges still lie ahead for this young research field.
   Among these, we identify scaling, calibration, validation, and balancing
   complexity as pressing issues. Moreover, particular process combinations
   are still understudied, and so far models tend to be developed for
   specific applications. Future work should aim at developing more
   flexible and modular models that not only allow different ecological
   theories to be expressed and contrasted, but which are also built for
   tight integration with all macroecological data sources. Moving the

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The study and conservation of endangered species is an important topic
   but collecting genetic samples is challenging as many of the threatened
   species are rare, elusive, or difficult to approach. Thus, the use of
   noninvasive samples to obtain genetic information has been gaining
   popularity. The noninvasive samples generally yield low DNA quantity and
   quality, which interferes with the genetic analyses performed. Several
   studies have identified factors that influence the amount and integrity
   of DNA extracted from noninvasive samples. Our work introduces a
   noninvasive DNA extraction method that can be modified and adapted to
   recover a large amount of DNA from stool samples. The protocol described
   here consists of two digestions and two purification steps and was
   tested on samples collected in the field from wild animals. This new
   method proved to be effective in the DNA extraction from scat samples in
   different conditions and from different species. The concentration of
   extracted DNA ranged from 30 to 70 ng/mu l for Equus hemionus, Equus
   africanus, and Equus kiang. The success of mtDNA amplification ranged
   between 80 and 100\% while for microsatellite markers the rate was
   between 65 and 100\%. The reproducibility between scorings of the
   amplified fragments ranged between 76 and 100\%. The current method has
   successfully improved the DNA yield on several species of wild equids.
   In addition to the classic genetic markers, we also test this method
   suitability for next-generation sequencing methods, by obtaining a
   RADseq library of 16 nM using 16 cycles and fragment size distribution
   similar to what is expected for high-quality samples. This protocol has
   successfully improved the DNA yield on different species by changing
   some steps of a classical spin-column DNA extraction protocol. We
   conclude that our fecal DNA extraction method can be used to provide DNA
   for a variety of downstream analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Novel selective pressures derived from human activities challenge the
   persistence of animal populations worldwide. Behavior is expected to be
   a major factor driving animals' responses to global change because it
   largely determines how animals interact with the environment. However,
   the role of individual variation in behavior to facilitate the
   persistence of animals in changing environments remains poorly
   understood. Here, we adopted an animal personality approach to
   investigate whether different behavioral traits allow animals to deal
   with two major components of global change: urbanization and biological
   invasions. By studying six populations of Anolis sagrei lizards, we
   found for the first time that anoles vary consistently in their behavior
   across different times and contexts. Importantly, these animal
   personalities were consistent in the wild and in captivity. We
   investigated whether behavioral traits are pulled in different
   directions by different components of global change. On the one hand, we
   found that lizards from urban areas differ from nearby forest lizards in
   that they were more tolerant of humans, less aggressive, bolder after a
   simulated predator attack, and they spent more time exploring new
   environments. Several of these risk-taking behaviors constituted a
   behavioral syndrome that significantly differed between urban and forest
   populations. On the other hand, the behavior of urban A.sagrei
   coexisting with the invasive predatory lizard Leiocephalus carinatus was
   associated with dramatic changes in their foraging niche. Overall, we
   provide evidence that differences in animal personalities facilitate the
   persistence of animals under novel selective regimes by producing
   adaptive behaviors relevant to their ecology such as predator avoidance.
   Our results suggest that natural selection can favor certain behaviors
   over others when animals are confronted with different ecological
   challenges posed by global change. Therefore, we underscore the need to
   incorporate behavioral ecology into the study of how animals adaptively
   respond to human-induced environmental changes.}},

Abstract = {{Understandings of contemporary forest cover loss are critical for policy
   but have come at the expense of long-term, multidirectional analyses of
   land cover change. This is a critical gap given (i) profound
   reconfigurations in land use and land control over the past several
   decades and (ii) evidence of widespread woodland resurgence' throughout
   the tropics. In this study, we argue that recent advancements within the
   field of land change science provide new opportunities to address this
   gap. In turn, we suggest that multidecadal and multidirectional analyses
   of land cover change can facilitate richer social analyses of land cover
   change and more relevant conservation policies and practice. Our
   argument is grounded in a case study from Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia.
   Using a novel analytical platform, Google Earth Engine, and open access

   Sulawesi, Indonesia, from 1972 to 2014. We find that tree cover loss
   constitutes the single largest net change over the period 1972-2014 but
   that gross rates of tree cover gain were three times higher than gross
   loss rates from 1972 to 1995 and equivalent to loss rates from 1995 to
   2014. We suggest the smallholder tree crop economy likely produced both
   forest loss and Imperata grassland restoration in this region. This case
   points to the need to expand rather than collapse the baselines used to
   study carbon and biodiversity change in tropical regions. It also
   demonstrates the possible utility of applying such methods to other
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{Given the substantial contributions of forest biodiversity and ecosystem
   services to society, forest sciences have a large potential to
   contribute to the integrity and sustainability of our future. This is
   especially true when the roles of biodiversity for sustaining ecosystem
   services are considered. The rapid expansion of sustainable forest
   management (SFM) has resulted in the adoption of various forest
   management frameworks intended to safeguard biodiversity. Concurrently,
   the importance of forest ecosystem services has been increasingly
   recognized. Although some initiatives aimed at conserving both
   biodiversity and ecosystem services are emerging, knowledge gaps still
   exist about their relationships and potential trade-offs in forests.
   Given recent advancements, increasing opportunities and some lags in
   forest ecology, further research on biodiversity, ecosystem functions
   and services will play substantial roles in the development of SFM
   practices. Here, we identified key issues including (i) relationships
   between biodiversity and ecosystem function as a foundation of
   ecological integrity, (ii) resilience thinking to better prepare for and
   adapt to environmental changes, (iii) social-ecological perspectives
   that facilitate real-world conservation and management and (iv)
   theory-driven restoration that bridges science and practice. Thus, we
   illustrate priorities and future possibilities in applied ecology
   studies in forests, which will help society and ecosystems to build
   capacity and resilience to face uncertainty in the changing
   environment.Synthesis and applications. Under substantial human
   influences, forests are highly likely to be largely altered, potentially
   leading to the emergence of novel ecosystems or alternative stable
   states. Management thus needs more flexible, novel measures to address
   the significant uncertainty this generates. Resilience-based approaches
   are important to respond adaptively to future changes and cope with
   surprises, potentially providing multiple options. Although challenges
   exist, theory should play an important role in managing, conserving and
   restoring forest ecosystems. The issues discussed here should receive
   further attention in the context of the multiple goals of sustainable
   forest management.}},

Abstract = {{An idea that which zones are the main disturbed areas in mining cities

Abstract = {{Land-use/land-cover (LULC) change models integrate the effects of
   anthropogenic drivers of landscape change. Spatially explicit LULC
   change models help at understanding the landscape mosaic that emerges
   from the interplay between local-scale decisions as well as regional and
   national policies. These models produce valuable spatially explicit
   scenarios of LULC change that underpin biodiversity impact and ecosystem
   services assessments. Most raster-based LULC change models adopt the
   demand-allocation approach to simulate land transitions (i.e. the
   transformation of one land-cover type to another for a given spatial
   unit). In a demand -allocation framework the expert fixes the demand (or
   quantity of change) and the LULC change model uses a spatial procedure
   to allocate the change (i.e. to select the cells to be transformed to
   the target land-cover type). Here, we propose a spatial allocation
   procedure that builds on the assumption that land transitions occur in
   two phases: change occurrence and change spreading (or contagion). The
   allocation procedure uses a sorted queue of cells waiting to undergone
   change. Three parameters (rate of change occurrence, rate of change
   spreading and acceleration of change-contagion) control the order of
   cells order in the queue, and ultimately determine the emergence and
   extent of patches-of-change. We performed a sensitivity analysis where
   we show that the relation between both rates (i.e. change occurrence and
   change spreading) allows patches-of-change expand before other patches
   arise or vice versa. We provide a simple protocol to implement the
   allocation procedure as the core of a spatial explicit LULC change
   model, and we applied this protocol in the development of a new model,
   called MEDLUC, that intends to replicate the most relevant transitions
   observed in Mediterranean landscapes: urbanisation, rural abandonment
   and agriculture conversion. For Catalonia, a region in NE Spain, MEDLUC
   reproduces the empirical patches-of-change distributions from a 16-year
   period at two spatial resolutions (1 km(2) and 1 ha). Overall, our
   allocation procedure performs better than a null model for urbanisation
   and rural abandonment at both resolutions, while it does worse when
   modelling agriculture conversion. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V..All rights

Abstract = {{Terrestrial ecosystems have absorbed roughly 30\% of anthropogenic CO2
   emissions over the past decades, but it is unclear whether this carbon
   (C) sink will endure into the future. Despite extensive modeling and
   experimental and observational studies, what fundamentally determines
   transient dynamics of terrestrial C storage under global change is still
   not very clear. Here we develop a new framework for understanding
   transient dynamics of terrestrial C storage through mathematical
   analysis and numerical experiments. Our analysis indicates that the
   ultimate force driving ecosystem C storage change is the C storage
   capacity, which is jointly determined by ecosystem C input (e.g., net
   primary production, NPP) and residence time. Since both C input and
   residence time vary with time, the C storage capacity is time-dependent
   and acts as a moving attractor that actual C storage chases. The rate of
   change in C storage is proportional to the C storage potential, which is
   the difference between the current storage and the storage capacity. The
   C storage capacity represents instantaneous responses of the land C
   cycle to external forcing, whereas the C storage potential represents
   the internal capability of the land C cycle to influence the C change
   trajectory in the next time step. The influence happens through
   redistribution of net C pool changes in a network of pools with
   different residence times.
   Moreover, this and our other studies have demonstrated that one matrix
   equation can replicate simulations of most land C cycle models (i.e.,
   physical emulators). As a result, simulation outputs of those models can
   be placed into a three-dimensional (3-D) parameter space to measure
   their differences. The latter can be decomposed into traceable
   components to track the origins of model uncertainty. In addition, the
   physical emulators make data assimilation computationally feasible so
   that both C flux- and pool-related datasets can be used to better
   constrain model predictions of land C sequestration. Overall, this new
   mathematical framework offers new approaches to understanding,
   evaluating, diagnosing, and improving land C cycle models.}},

Abstract = {{Ozone (O-3) is a toxic air pollutant that can damage plant leaves and
   substantially affect the plant's gross primary production (GPP) and
   health. Realistic estimates of the effects of tropospheric anthropogenic
   O3 on GPP are thus potentially important to assess the strength of the
   terrestrial biosphere as a carbon sink. To better understand the impact
   of ozone damage on the terrestrial carbon cycle, we developed a module
   to estimate O-3 uptake and damage of plants for a state-of-the-art
   global terrestrial biosphere model called OCN. Our approach accounts for
   ozone damage by calculating (a) O-3 transport from 45m height to leaf
   level, (b) O-3 flux into the leaf, and (c) ozone damage of
   photosynthesis as a function of the accumulated O-3 uptake over the
   lifetime of a leaf.
   A comparison of modelled canopy conductance, GPP, and latent heat to
   FLUXNET data across European forest and grassland sites shows a general
   good performance of OCN including ozone damage. This comparison provides
   a good baseline on top of which ozone damage can be evaluated. In
   comparison to literature values, we demonstrate that the new model
   version produces realistic O-3 surface resistances, O-3 deposition
   velocities, and stomatal to total O-3 flux ratios. A sensitivity study
   reveals that key metrics of the air-to-leaf O-3 transport and O-3
   deposition, in particular the stomatal O-3 uptake, are reasonably robust
   against uncertainty in the underlying parameterisation of the deposition
   scheme. Nevertheless, correctly estimating canopy conductance plays a
   pivotal role in the estimate of cumulative O-3 uptake. We further find
   that accounting for stomatal and non-stomatal uptake processes
   substantially affects simulated plant O-3 uptake and accumulation,
   because aerodynamic resistance and non-stomatal O-3 destruction reduce
   the predicted leaf-level O-3 concentrations. Ozone impacts on GPP and
   transpiration in a Europe-wide simulation indicate that tropospheric O-3
   impacts the regional carbon and water cycling less than expected from
   previous studies. This study presents a first step towards the
   integration of atmospheric chemistry and ecosystem dynamics modelling,
   which would allow for assessing the wider feedbacks between vegetation
   ozone uptake and tropospheric ozone burden.}},

Abstract = {{Temperate, mesic forests (TMFs) are generally viewed as being in a
   shifting-mosaic or a kind of dynamic equilibrium at broad spatial
   scales. Gaining insight to the potential dynamics of TMFs at
   large-scales is crucial because these species-rich, highly productive
   forests are important drivers of regional water and carbon cycles for
   approximately one billion people.
   Here, we briefly review the disturbance dynamics of TMFs in eastern
   North America, Central Europe, and Japan, as well as the temperate
   rainforests of northwestern North America and western Eurasia. We find
   that current knowledge effectively describes the relatively frequent
   disturbance processes from stand to landscape scales. The few
   large-scale dendroecological networks in TMFs, however, suggest that
   large, infrequent disturbances (LIDs), those at regional scales or
   larger, are also important drivers of forest development. We also
   discuss the potential reasons why the spatiotemporal scales at which
   most ecological research is conducted-centennial-scale investigations
   (or longer) at small spatial scales or regional investigations (and
   larger) that only cover a few years to a decade or two-might bias our
   perception of TMF dynamics.
   Our review leads us to hypothesize that the dynamic equilibrium concept
   in TMFs could be challenged by findings derived from broad-scale
   networks containing centuries of forest dynamics at high temporal
   resolution. Dendroecology is poised for this challenge. We provide
   dendroecological solutions to test the hypothesis that LIDs are
   important for long-term TMF dynamics. Our review also leads us to assert
   that the successional trajectories in TMFs are likely more diverse than
   what is commonly considered. Constraining the potential number of
   trajectories likely constrains ecological theory and forest management.
   To expand these perceptions, we present a conceptual model to aid
   comprehension of the potential n-dimensional developmental trajectories
   in diverse TMFs.
   As we close in on a century of tree-ring research, new frontiers are
   being opened through the development of new methods and techniques that
   enhance investigations of temperate mesic forests. Applying these
   advances will help to address urgent questions on macroecological
   dynamics of temperate, mesic forests as climate change intensifies over
   the next century.}},

   large and costly fires have raised urgent questions about how different

   reconstructions of historical fire frequency, severity, spatial
   variability, and extent, corroborated by other lines of evidence, are
   essential in addressing these questions. Existing methods can infer the
   severity of individual fires and stand-level fire regimes. However,
   novel research designs combining evidence of stand-level fire severity
   with fire extent are now being used to reconstruct spatial variability
   in historical fire regimes and to quantify the relative abundance of

Abstract = {{Agriculture and forestry traditionally focus on improving plant growth
   traits based on an anthropocentric point of view. This paradigm has led
   to global problems associated to soil overexploitation such as soil
   losses, reductions of the C stock in soils, and the generalized use of
   fertilizers, which particularly increases the costs of production and
   pollution treatment. This view may also have limited our understanding
   of mutualistic symbioses of plants and microorganisms assuming that the
   main role of non-photosynthetic symbionts is to mobilize the nutrients
   that are necessary for plant growth and development, and being plants
   the dominant agents of the symbiotic relationship. In response to these
   issues, this chapter offers an alternative approach taking advantage of
   the ``rhizo-centric{''} point of view, where non-photosynthetic partners
   are the main protagonists in play; and secondly, it builds a
   multidisciplinary body of knowledge that could be called
   ``rhizoculture{''}, which includes techniques focussing on the
   intensification of the development and activity of roots, mycorrhizae,
   and other symbiotic and free living rhizosphere organisms. In short,
   rhizoculture may lead to decrease plant production dependence on
   fertilization and provides other benefits to agriculture, forestry, and
   the environment. Within this conceptual framework, the first objective
   of this book chapter is to explore whether there is a ``paradox of
   calcium salts{''} (i.e., Ca2+ and its salts are simultaneously
   nutrients, promoters, and stressors for the host plants) that would
   explain a dominance of mycorrhizal fungi over plants based on inducing a
   Ca(pH)mediated chlorosis to the host plants. If this paradigm shifting
   hypothesis were finally fully verified, it would provide conceptual
   bases to reconsider our current technologies in agriculture and forestry
   by introducing the ``rhizocultural{''} approach, based on the management
   of roots (introducing alternative cultural practices), Ca2+ salts (using
   liming and other techniques), rock-eating mycorrhizae, organic matter,
   and the soil microbiome (increasing the presence of symbiotic
   microorganisms against saprophytes), N and P contents (by aquaculture
   and smart recycling of organic waste), and the physical properties of
   the soil (by the activity of soil symbiotic microorganisms and soil
   fauna, such as ants, termites and earthworms). The development of such
   new technological approaches in rhizoculture would significantly
   decrease the high cost and associated pollution of the application of
   fertilizers and phytochemicals; as well as it would increase soil C
   stocks, improve the resilience of agricultural and forest systems to
   environmental disturbances, such as climate change, and enhance food
   production and security.}},

Abstract = {{Rangelands around the world provide economic benefits, and ecological
   services are critical to the cultural and social fabric of societies.
   However, the proliferation of invasive non-native plants have altered
   rangelands and led to numerous economic impacts on livestock production,
   quality, and health. They have resulted in broad-scale changes in plant
   and animal communities and alter the abiotic conditions of systems. The
   most significant of these invasive plants can lead to ecosystem
   instability, and sometimes irreversible transformational changes.
   However, in many situations invasive plants provide benefits to the
   ecosystem. Such changes can result in novel ecosystems where the focus
   of restoration efforts has shifted from preserving the historic species
   assemblages to conserving and maintaining a resilient, functional system
   that provides diverse ecosystem service, while supporting human
   livelihoods. Thus, the concept of novel ecosystems should consider other
   tools, such as state-and-transition models and adaptive management,
   which provide holistic and flexible approaches for controlling invasive
   plants, favor more desirable plant species, and lead to ecosystem
   resilience. Explicitly defining reclamation, rehabilitation, and
   restoration goals is an important consideration regarding novel
   ecosystems and it allows for better identification of simple, realistic
   targets and goals. Over the past two decades invasive plant management
   in rangelands has adopted an ecosystem perspective that focuses on
   identification, management, and monitoring ecological processes that
   lead to invasion, and to incorporating proactive prevention programs and
   integrated management strategies that broaden the ecosystem perspective.
   Such programs often include rehabilitation concepts that increase the
   success of long-term management, ecosystem function, and greater
   invasion resistance.}},

Title = {{Managing Climate Change Risks in Rangeland Systems}},
Booktitle = {{RANGELAND SYSTEMS: PROCESSES, MANAGEMENT AND CHALLENGES}},
Series = {{Springer Series on Environmental Management}},
Year = {{2017}},
Pages = {{491-526}},
Abstract = {{The management of rangelands has long involved adapting to climate
   variability to ensure that economic enterprises remain viable and
   ecosystems sustainable; climate change brings the potential for change
   that surpasses the experience of humans within rangeland systems.
   Adaptation will require an intentionality to address the effects of
   climate change. Knowledge of vulnerability in these systems provides the
   foundation upon which to base adaptation strategies; however, few
   vulnerability assessments have examined and integrated the climate
   vulnerability of the ecological, economic, and social components of
   rangeland systems. The capacity of ecosystems, humans, and institutions
   to adjust to potential damage and to take advantage of opportunities is
   termed adaptive capacity. Given past attempts to cope with drought,
   current adaptive capacity is not sufficient to sustain rangeland
   enterprises under increasing climatic variability. Just as ecosystem
   development is affected by past events, historical studies suggest that
   past events in human communities influence future choices in response to
   day-to-day as well as abrupt events. All adaptation is local and no
   single adaptation approach works in all settings. A risk framework for
   adaptation could integrate key vulnerabilities, risk, and hazards, and
   facilitate development of adaptation actions that address the entire
   socio-ecological system. Adaptation plans will need to be developed and
   implemented with recognition of future uncertainty that necessitates an
   iterative implementation process as new experience and information
   accumulate. Developing the skills to manage with uncertainty may be a
   singularly important strategy that landowners, managers, and scientists
   require to develop adaptive capacity.}},
