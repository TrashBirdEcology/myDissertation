	abstract = {Fisher's information number is the second moment of the “score function” where the derivative is with respect to x rather than Θ. It is Fisher's information for a location parameter, and also called shift-invariant Fisher information. In recent years, Fisher's information number has been frequently used in several places regardless of parameters of the distribution or of their nature. Is this number a nominal, standard, and typical measure of information? The Fisher information number is examined in light of the properties of classical statistical information theory. It has some properties analogous to those of Fisher's measure, but, in general, it does not have good properties if used as a measure of information when Θ is not a location parameter. Even in the case of location parameter, the regularity conditions must be satisfied. It does not possess the two fundamental properties of the mother information, namely the monotonicity and invariance under sufficient transformations. Thus the Fisher information number should not be used as a measure of information (except when Θ a location parameter). On the other hand, Fisher's information number, as a characteristic of a distribution f(x), has other interesting properties. As a byproduct of its superadditivity property a new coefficient of association is introduced.},

Traditional spatial boundary detection procedures that result in ecoregion maps are typically based on ecological potential (i.e. potential vegetation), and often fail to account for ongoing changes due to stressors such as land use change and climate change and their effects on plant and animal communities. We use Fisher information, an information theory-based method, on both terrestrial and aquatic animal data (U.S. Breeding Bird Survey and marine zooplankton) to identify ecological boundaries, and compare our results to traditional early warning indicators, conventional ecoregion maps and multivariate analyses such as nMDS and cluster analysis. We successfully detected spatial regimes and transitions in both terrestrial and aquatic systems using Fisher information. Furthermore, Fisher information provided explicit spatial information about community change that is absent from other multivariate approaches. Our results suggest that defining spatial regimes based on animal communities may better reflect ecological reality than do traditional ecoregion maps, especially in our current era of rapid and unpredictable ecological change.},

However, a seemingly abrupt transition can be the product of a system reorganization that has been ongoing much longer than is evident in statistical analysis of a single component of the system. Using both univariate and multivariate statistical methods, we tested a long-term high-resolution paleoecological dataset with a known change in species assemblage for a regime shift. Analysis of this dataset with Fisher Information and multivariate time series modeling showed that there was a∼2000 year period of instability prior to the regime shift. This period of instability and the subsequent regime shift coincide with regional climate change, indicating that the system is undergoing extrinsic forcing. Paleoecological records offer a unique opportunity to test tools for the detection of thresholds and stable-states, and thus to examine the long-term stability of ecosystems over periods of multiple millennia.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems often exhibit transitions between multiple dynamic regimes (or steady states), such as the conversion of oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions and associated aquatic ecological communities, due to natural (or increasingly) anthropogenic disturbances. As ecosystems experience perturbations of varying regularity and intensity, they may either remain within the state space neighborhood of the current regime or “flip” into the neighborhood of a regime with different characteristics. An increasingly integral aspect of many ecological, economic, and social decisions is their impact on the sustainability of particular dynamic regimes of ecosystems. Sustainability entails a human preference for one particular regime versus another, and the persistence of that regime with regard to the human and natural perturbations exacted on the system.
Information theory has significantly advanced our ability to quantify the organizational complexity inherent in systems despite imperfect observations or ‘signals’ from the source system. Fisher Information is one of several measures developed under the theme of estimation theory. Fisher Information can be described in three ways: as a measure of the degree to which a parameter (or state of a system) can be estimated; as a measure of the relative amount of information that exists between different states of a system; as a measure of the disorder or chaos of a system. Fisher Information may be a useful measure to identify the degree to which a system is at risk of “flipping” into a different dynamic regime.
We developed a Fisher Information index for dynamic systems in a periodic steady state and applied it to a simple, two species Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model. Changes in the carrying capacity (size) of the system resulted in different stable steady states establishing themselves, each with a characteristic Fisher Information. By repeatedly calculating Fisher Information over time, transitions or “flips” between steady states were identified with changes in Fisher Information. We then examined data collected from four ecological systems (of increasingly large spatial and temporal scale) that have demonstrated regime transitions: the Bering Strait/Pacific Ocean food web; the western Africa savanna; the Florida (USA) pine–oak system; the global climate system. These datasets are noisy and reflect several to many cycles that are out of phase, which complicates the identification of both dynamic regimes and transitions. If transition phases between regimes can be detected early enough, human activity suspected of contributing to regime changes can be altered (or continued if the resultant steady state is desirable, such as in ecosystem restoration efforts).},

Each contestant wants to maximize his level of Fisher information I. The game is zero sum, by conservation of information in the closed system. The payoff of the game introduces a variational principle—extreme physical information (EPI)—which fixes both the Lagrangian and the physical constant of each scenario. The EPI approach provides an understanding of the relationship between measurement and physical law. EPI also defines a prescription for constructing Lagrangians. The prior knowledge required for this purpose is a rule of symmetry or conservation that implies a unitary transformation for which I remains invariant. As an example, when applied to the smart measurement of the space-time coordinate of a particle, the symmetry used is that between position-time space and momentum-energy space. Then the unitary transformation is the Fourier one, and EPI derives the following: the equivalence of energy, momentum, and mass; the constancy of Planck’s parameter h; and the Lagrangian that implies both the Klein-Gordon equation and the Dirac equation of quantum mechanics.},

When calculated repeatedly over the system period, this index tracks steady states and transient behavior. We believe that such an index could be useful in detecting system ‘flips’ associated with a regime change, i.e. determining when systems are in a transient between one steady state and another.

FI was developed as a measure of information content in data, and it has been adapted to assess order in complex system behaviour. The main advantage of the approach is the ability to collapse multiple variables into an index that can be used to assess stability and track overall trends in a system, including its regimes and regime shifts. Here, we provide a brief overview of FI theory, followed by a simple step-by-step numerical example on how to compute FI. Furthermore, we introduce an open source Python library that can be freely downloaded from GitHub and we use it in a simple case study to evaluate the evolution of FI for the global-mean temperature from 1880 to 2015. Results indicate significant declines in FI starting in 1978, suggesting a possible regime shift.},

Our adaptation of Fisher information provides a means of monitoring the variables of a system to characterize dynamic order, and, therefore, its regimes and regime shifts. This work is part of the SLB Sustainability Metrics Project, which aimed to evaluate movement over time towards or away from regional sustainability. One of the key goals of this project was to use readily available data to assess the sustainability of the system including its environmental, social and economic aspects. For this study, Fisher information was calculated for fifty-three variables which characterize the consumption of food and energy, agricultural production, environmental characteristics, demographic properties and changes in land use for the SLB system from 1980 to 2005. Our analysis revealed that while the system displayed small changes in dynamic order over time with a slight decreasing trend near the end of the period, there is no indication of a regime shift. Therefore, the SLB system is stable with very slight movement away from sustainability in more recent years.},

As such, this document has been developed as a guide for interpreting Fisher Information as sustainability metric. Moreover, this study provides details on an analytical and numerical approach to estimating Fisher information based on the evaluation of changes in the system’s trajectory for determining stable and unstable regimes in real systems, which might represent sustainable or unsustainable systems. Using this novel approach, the sustainability of US air quality characterized by criteria pollutants (i.e., lead, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide) was assessed from 1980 to 2009. Further, the precision of Fisher Information computations was examined, thereby establishing an alternative procedure for evaluating real systems characterized by noisy and sparse datasets. Throughout this article, the reader is led through the analysis of Fisher Information results with the goal of both providing guidance on the interpretation of Fisher Information and giving a more tactile understanding of the results applied to sustainability assessment.},

What is often overlooked is the need for continuity such that desirable system behavior is maintained with mechanisms in place that facilitate the ability of core system functions to endure or adapt (in the face of perturbations), and ensure that future generations are able to meet their needs. Assessing regional systems poses unique challenges in that they are interlinked with larger- and smaller-scale dynamics that may dramatically affect trends in key system variables. From 1970–2009, Puerto Rico experienced a 140\% increase in urban population which may have amplified impacts related to resource demands, waste production, and natural habitats. Because such changes can have strong implications for sustainability, the dynamics of Puerto Rico provide a great opportunity to explore methods for assessing the sustainability of a complex geographic region. In this work, we employ Fisher information, an information theory-based approach, to evaluate changes in system dynamics and examine the effect of regionalization impacts on trends in variables characterizing social, environmental, and economic aspects of the system. Results indicate dramatic change from 1981–1999, after which the system dynamics remained steady until 2005. While there was no indication that a regime shift occurred, system trends corresponded with variations in non-yield economic variables. To determine whether Fisher information provides warning signals of critical change, consecutive declines in the index were explored and demonstrated as a possible leading indicator of impending regime shifts.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a methodology that combines the power of an Artificial Neural Network and Information Theory to forecast variables describing the condition of a regional system. The novelty and strength of this approach is in the application of Fisher information, a key method in Information Theory, to preserve trends in the historical data and prevent over fitting projections. The methodology was applied to demographic, environmental, food and energy consumption, and agricultural production in the San Luis Basin regional system in Colorado, U.S.A. These variables are important for tracking conditions in human and natural systems. However, available data are often so far out of date that they limit the ability to manage these systems. Results indicate that the approaches developed provide viable tools for forecasting outcomes with the aim of assisting management toward sustainable trends. This methodology is also applicable for modeling different scenarios in other dynamic systems.},

	abstract = {While sustainability is generally associated with the definition of sustainable development given by the Brundtland Commission ‘Our common future (1987) Oxford University Press,’ namely ‘development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,’ it is important to recognize that a mathematical theory embodying these concepts would be immensely valuable in humanity's efforts to manage the environment. The concept of sustainability applies to integrated systems comprising humans and the rest of nature. The structures and operation of the human component (in terms of society, economy, law, etc.) must be such that these reinforce or promote the persistence of the structures and operation of the natural component (in terms of ecosystem trophic linkages, biodiversity, biogeochemical cycles, etc.), and vice versa. Thus, one of the challenges of sustainability research lies in linking measures of ecosystem functioning to the structure and operation of the associated social system. We propose that indicators based on Information Theory can bridge the natural and human system elements, and make sense of the disparate state variables of the system. Thus, in this paper we explore the use of Fisher Information, which is a statistical measure of variation, as an aggregating index for dynamic systems of many variables. We have developed a novel application of Fisher Information to time-series data of dynamic systems, which (borrowing from statistical mechanics) uses an ensemble average of the system dynamics. We demonstrate this methodology using an uncalibrated 5-trophic level, 12-compartment (species) food web model with an associated basic social system for the population of omnivores at the top of the food chain. The model has five functional groups: detritus, primary producers, herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores. In addition to a seasonal forcing function, perturbation scenarios involving each of the parts of the system are simulated so as to explore the sustainability of the system under various types of stress, including basic human behaviors, such as agriculture. Since Fisher Information is a measure of the variation, we hypothesize that it is an indicator of system order, and thus system sustainability. This work is part of a multidisciplinary group at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Risk Management Research Laboratory.},

Sustainability of an ecosystem refers to the robustness of a preferred dynamic regime to human and natural disturbances. Ecosystems under perturbations of varying regularity and intensity can either remain within the current regime or transition into the neighbourhood of a regime with different (viz. less desirable) characteristics. The Fisher Information index we develop is based on the probability of finding the system in a particular state. We apply the index to a 10-compartment food web model with five functional groups: detritus, primary producers, herbivores, carnivores, and an omnivore. Fisher Information is shown to be sensitive to transients in model generated data. Such transients can be indicative of a transition to a new dynamic regime. Early detection of transitions to undesirable regimes may permit management intervention.},

We present our efforts at constructing a theory from Information Theory and Ecological Models. We discuss the state of complex systems that incorporate ecological and other components in terms of dynamic behavior in a phase space defined by the system state variables. From sampling the system trajectory, a distribution function for the probability of observing the system in a given state is constructed, and an expression for the Fisher information is derived. Fisher information is the maximum amount of information available from a set of observations, in this case, states of the system. Fisher information is a function of the variability of the observations such that low variability leads to high Fisher information and high variability leads to low Fisher information. Systems in stable dynamic states have constant Fisher information. Systems losing organization migrate toward higher variability and lose Fisher information. Self-organizing systems decrease their variability and acquire Fisher information. These considerations lead us to propose a sustainability hypothesis: “sustainable systems do not lose or gain Fisher information over time.” We illustrate these concepts using simulated ecological systems in stable and unstable states, and we discuss the underlying dynamics.},

Many such indices have been proposed and here we investigate two: exergy and Fisher Information. Exergy, a thermodynamically based index, is a measure of the maximum amount of useable work that can be extracted when a system is brought into equilibrium with a reference state. The measure for exergy used herein, also includes a factor to weigh the “complexity” of the ecological species. Fisher Information is an old statistical measure that has recently been applied as a way to detect change in system regime and as a measure of system order. These two indices are compared on a 10-compartment food web model undergoing five different perturbation scenarios. This food web model, although simple, allows for some interesting insight into the two indices. The results show that generally, although not always, exergy and Fisher Information respond differently, such that when one increases due to a perturbation the other decreases and vice versa. We provide a discussion as to the usefulness of these metrics as ecological indices and as their potential use as ecological goal functions in light of these findings.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a collection of four articles describing the San Luis Basin Sustainability Metrics Project. The Project developed a methodology for evaluating regional sustainability. This introduction provides the necessary background information for the project, description of the region, overview of the methods, and summary of the results. Although there are a multitude of scientifically based sustainability metrics, many are data intensive, difficult to calculate, and fail to capture all aspects of a system. We wanted to see if we could develop an approach that decision-makers could use to understand if their system was moving toward or away from sustainability. The goal was to produce a scientifically defensible, but straightforward and inexpensive methodology to measure and monitor environmental quality within a regional system. We initiated an interdisciplinary pilot project in the San Luis Basin, south-central Colorado, to test the methodology. The objectives were: 1) determine the applicability of using existing datasets to estimate metrics of sustainability at a regional scale; 2) calculate metrics through time from 1980 to 2005; and 3) compare and contrast the results to determine if the system was moving toward or away from sustainability. The sustainability metrics, chosen to represent major components of the system, were: 1) Ecological Footprint to capture the impact and human burden on the system; 2) Green Net Regional Product to represent economic welfare; 3) Emergy to capture the quality-normalized flow of energy through the system; and 4) Fisher information to capture the overall dynamic order and to look for possible regime changes. The methodology, data, and results of each metric are presented in the remaining four papers of the special collection. Based on the results of each metric and our criteria for understanding the sustainability trends, we find that the San Luis Basin is moving away from sustainability. Although we understand there are strengths and limitations of the methodology, we argue that each metric identifies changes to major components of the system. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The dynamics structure of many complex system there often happens a suddenly change due to the effect of outside force in nature. This abrupt change is closely related to human life. In order to make an accurate prediction of abrupt change and take corresponding measures, abrupt change should be detected effectively. Fisher information (FI) can keenly catch and characterize a small change in probability density distribution (PDD) of a system variable. While there is a change in dynamic structure of a system, the PDD of the system variable will have some changes correspondingly. In view of this, in this paper we describe in detail that FT is used to detect and recognize the abrupt change of system dynamics structure, and it is a new method to solve the detection of abrupt change in dynamic structure of a system. First of all, this method is used to present the ability to detect abrupt change lying in ideal datasets of different types of ideal signals. Next, this method is used to analyze daily datasets of ground climate from national meteorological information center of China meteorological administration between 1960 and 2008 in Lanzhou meteorological observation station in Northwest area.

This concept is often used to describe the collapse of ecological systems, but it also appears in many engineering systems; most notably in the voltage collapse of power systems. This paper uses an information theoretic index known as the Fisher Information (FI) as a real-time statistical index detecting regime shifts in a stressed IEEE 118 bus system. These preliminary experiments demonstrate that the FI index indeed provide early warning of abnormal operations leading to voltage instability. As a data driven method the proposed FI index provides a useful tool supporting the real-time monitoring of power system operations.},

This basic understanding further includes a sense of the time scale of possible future events and the limits of what is and is not likely to be possible. With this understanding, systematic approaches can then be used to develop policy guidelines for the system. This article presents an illustration of these ideas by analyzing an integrated ecological-economic-social model, which comprises various ecological (natural) and domesticated compartments representing species along with a macroeconomic price setting model. The stable and qualitatively realistic model is used to analyze different relevant scenarios. Apart from highlighting complex relationships within the system, it identifies potentially unsustainable future developments such as increased human per capita consumption rates. Dynamic optimization is then used to develop time-de pendent policy guidelines for the unsustainable scenarios using objective functions that aim to minimize fluctuations in the system's Fisher information. The results can help to identify effective policy parameters and highlight the tradeoff between natural and domesticated compartments while managing such integrated systems. The results should also qualitatively guide further investigations in the area of system level studies and policy development.},

	abstract = {Many ecological studies are characterized by paucity of hard data. Statistical analysis in such situations leads to flat-likelihood functions and wide confidence intervals. Although, there is paucity of hard data, expert knowledge about the phenomenon under study is many times available. Such expert opinion may be used to strengthen statistical inference in these situations. Subjective Bayesian is one approach to incorporate expert opinion in statistical studies. This approach, aside from the subjectivity, also faces operational problems. Elicitation of the prior is the most difficult step. Another is the lack of a precise quantitative definition of what characterizes an expert. In this paper, we discuss a different approach to incorporating subjective expert opinion in statistical analyses. We argue that it is easier to elicit data than to elicit a prior. Such elicited data can then be used to supplement the hard, observed data to possibly improve precision of statistical analyses. The approach suggested here also leads to a natural definition of what constitutes a useful expert. We define a useful expert as one whose opinion adds information over and above what is provided by the observed data. This can be quantified in terms of the change in the Fisher information before and after using the expert opinion. One can, thus, avoid the real possibility of using an expert opinion that adds noise, instead of information, to the hard data. We illustrate this approach using an ecological problem of modeling and predicting occurrence of species. An interesting outcome of this analysis is that statistical thinking helps discriminate between a useful expert and a not so useful expert; expertness need not be decided purely on the basis of experience, fame, or such qualitative characteristics.

Assessing their performance can therefore be difficult. In this work, we use concepts of Fisher information (FI) to analyse the stability in the performance of PTS in the 372 US urbanized areas (UZA) reported by the National Transit Database. The key advantage of FI is its ability to handle multiple variables simultaneously to provide information about overall trends of a system. It can therefore detect whether a system is stable or heading towards instability, and whether any regime shifts have occurred or are approaching. A regime shift is a fundamental change in the dynamics of the system, e.g. major and lasting change in service. Here, we first provide a brief background on FI and then compute and analyse FI for all US PTS using monthly data from 2002 to 2016; datasets include unlinked passenger trips (i.e. demand) and vehicle revenue miles (i.e. supply). We detect eight different patterns from the results. We find that most PTS are seeking stability, although some PTS have gone through regime shifts. We also observe that several PTS have consistently decreasing FI results, which is a cause for concern. FI results with detailed explanations are provided for eight major UZA.},

Based on rigorous analysis of the local asymptotic normality property and the Fisher information, we discuss some issues in unbiased joint estimation of the model parameters, in particular, the maximum-likelihood estimation. We present that there exist both theoretical and practical difficulties in more realistic tempered Pareto and fractional Gaussian random walk models from a statistical standpoint.

The approach has been shown to be Suitable for the analysis of ecological models, including dynamic simulations as well as optimal control problems where the objective function involves maximizing or minimizing Fisher information. Nevertheless, Fisher information can also be interpreted as a measure of the degree of variability of a dynamic system. The goal of this work is two-fold. First, we study the scope of using the concept of Fisher information as a sustainability index in dynamic systems different in nature from ecological systems. Then we study the behavior of Fisher information in terms of the variability and performance of the dynamic system rather than using it as a sustainability index. The results of three case studies are presented, including two chemical engineering applications (a continuous crystallization system and a series of three continuous stirred tank reactors) and a dynamic model of immunotherapy (therapeutic optimization). We perform parametric analyses, evaluating the behavior of the value of Fisher information against significant model parameters. In general, although its usefulness as a sustainability index might be difficult to interpret and elucidate in some cases, Fisher information not only can indeed be related to the degree of variability of any dynamic system, but also provides useful insights with potential application in process control.},

Fisher, have argued in favour of the variance estimate 1/I(x), where I(x) is the observed information, i.e. minus the second derivative of the log likelihood function at θ given data x. We give a frequentist justification for preferring 1/I(x) to 1/§. The former is shown to approximate the conditional variance of 8 given an appropriate ancillary statistic which to a first approximation is I(x). The theory may be seen to flow naturally from Fisher's pioneering papers on likelihood estimation. A large number of examples are used to supplement a small amount of theory. Our evidence indicates preference for the likelihood ratio method of obtaining confidence limits.},

However, we can use the Bayes estimates as an approximation to the objective ML estimates if we use an appropriate transformation that makes the posterior distribution close to a normal distribution. One-to-one correspondence exists between a uniform prior distribution under a transformed scale and a non-uniform prior distribution under the original scale.

A great deal of good science was done using these tools, but both schools suffer from technical and philosophical difficulties. At the turning of the 21st century (Royall in Statistical evidence: a likelihood paradigm. Chapman \& Hall, London, 1997; Lele in The nature of scientific evidence: statistical, philosophical and empirical considerations. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, pp 191–216, 2004a), evidential statistics emerged as a seriously contending paradigm. Drawing on and refining elements from error statistics, likelihoodism, Bayesian statistics, information criteria, and robust methods, evidential statistics is a statistical modern synthesis that smoothly incorporates model identification, model uncertainty, model comparison, parameter estimation, parameter uncertainty, pre-data control of error, and post-data strength of evidence into a single coherent framework. We argue that evidential statistics is currently the most effective statistical paradigm to support 21st century science. Despite the power of the evidential paradigm, we think that there is no substitute for learning how to clarify scientific arguments with statistical arguments. In this paper we sketch and relate the conceptual bases of error statistics, Bayesian statistics and evidential statistics. We also discuss a number of misconceptions about the paradigms that have hindered practitioners, as well as some real problems with the error and Bayesian statistical paradigms solved by evidential statistics.},

The model, a stochastic version of the Gompertz model, can be transformed into a linear Gaussian state-space model (Kalman filter) for convenient fitting to time series data. The model has a multivariate normal likelihood function and is simple enough for a variety of uses ranging from theoretical study of parameter estimation issues to routine data analyses in population monitoring. A special case of the model is the discrete-time, stochastic exponential growth model (density independence) with environmental-type process error and lognormal observation error. We describe two methods for estimating parameters in the Gompertz state-space model, and we compare the statistical qualities of the methods with computer simulations. The methods are maximum likelihood based on observations and restricted maximum likelihood based on first differences. Both offer adequate statistical properties. Because the likelihood function is identical to a repeated-measures analysis of variance model with a random time effect, parameter estimates can be calculated using PROC MIXED of SAS. We use the model to analyze a data set from the Breeding Bird Survey. The fitted model suggests that over 70\% of the noise in the population's growth rate is due to observation error. The model describes the autocovariance properties of the data especially well. While observation error and process noise variance parameters can both be estimated from one time series, multimodal likelihood functions can and do occur. For data arising from the model, the statistically consistent parameter estimates do not necessarily correspond to the global maximum in the likelihood function. Maximization, simulation, and bootstrapping programs must accommodate the phenomenon of multimodal likelihood functions to produce statistically valid results.},

It is argued that the probabilities are personal. The roles of likelihood and exchangeability are explained.

	abstract = {Urban systems have a number of factors (i.e., economic, social, and environmental) that can potentially impact growth, change, and transition. As such, assessing and managing these systems is a complex challenge. While, tracking trends of key variables may provide some insight, identifying the critical characteristics that truly impact the dynamic behavior of these systems is difficult. As an integrated approach to evaluate real urban systems, this work contributes to the research on scientific techniques for assessing sustainability. Specifically, it proposes a practical methodology based on the estimation of dynamic order, for identifying stable and unstable periods of sustainable or unsustainable trends with Fisher Information (FI) metric. As a test case, the dynamic behavior of the City, Suburbs, and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) of Cincinnati was evaluated by using 29 social and 11 economic variables to characterize each system from 1970 to 2009. Air quality variables were also selected to describe the MSA’s environmental component (1980–2009). Results indicate systems dynamic started to change from about 1995 for the social variables and about 2000 for the economic and environmental characteristics.},

	abstract = {The development of a comprehensive sustainability analysis tool for evaluating regional urban systems would present researchers, planners, and policy makers with a powerful tool to study and manage systems, with the goal of encouraging optimum social and economic trends, while maintaining long-term environmental protection that leads to sustainability. This article intends to aid in this effort by presenting a versatile methodology for assessing sustainability as a function of dynamic changes in significant characteristics of urban systems. Using statistical methods, this work presents a strategy for comparatively assessing the impact of social and economic characteristics on system stability at geographic scales which are critical to policy and management. Specifically, it employs the Fisher Information index as a measure of sustainability, in order to distinguish periods of stability. As an application of the approach, six Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in Ohio (Cincinnati, Dayton, Cleveland, Akron, Columbus, and Toledo) were evaluated for a regional sustainability assessment. Results from the multiyear analysis suggest two distinct periods in these MSAs: one characterized by 30 years of socio-economic growth (1970–1999) and another (2000–2009) denoting a change in the trajectory of each system found to be related to economic recession. Columbus was identified as the most stable and sustainable of the MSAs during the study period. In contrast, Toledo exhibited the largest changes in economic trends, as distinguished by excessive increases in the growth rate of vacant housing units, unemployed civilian labor force, and inhabitants below the poverty level (2000–2009). Since such conditions are not desirable for urban systems, they are indicative of movement towards an unsustainable future.},
