Abstract = {{Temperature is a fundamental driver of aquatic environments. Changes in
   thermal regimes due to timber harvest may be detrimental for cold-water
   instream biota. Although it is understood that stream temperature may
   increase immediately below timber harvest operations, the understanding
   of how thermal responses propagate downstream is less clear. Here, we
   examine the effects of timber harvest on stream temperature pre-(2-3
   years) and post-harvest (5 years) at 16 sites (average annual streamflow
   rates <0.283 m(3) s(-1)) located in the Coast Range, Oregon, USA. At
   each site, an array of temperature sensors were deployed on the extremes
   of three consecutive reaches: an upstream unharvested reference reach, a
   treatment reach, and a downstream unharvested reach. We used several
   metrics to describe and evaluate changes over time and space focusing on
   the responses of downstream reaches. Primarily, we evaluated the
   differences over time in daily maximum temperature between the two
   sensors located at the downstream unharvested reach. Furthermore, using
   a statistical ordination technique, we examined the spatial and temporal
   variability of an array of sensors for daily maximum temperature.
   Moreover, we assessed distributional shifts (statistical moments) of
   hourly temperature differences between the two sensors at the downstream
   unharvested reach over time. Lastly, we used a combination of
   statistical moments and the ordination technique to provide an index
   that describes the behavior of site-specific thermal disturbance over
   time. We found that stream reaches responded differently to upstream
   timber harvest operations between pre and post-harvest summer seasons.
   In addition, we showed distinct patterns of longitudinal variability of
   temperature across sites and summer seasons with increases, decreases or
   mixed responses including no change downstream. Overall, the net change
   of daily maximum temperature at the downstream reach revealed that the
   highest difference occurred during the first and second year
   post-harvest and, in some cases, a distinctive shift in stream warming
   and cooling occurred between the day and the night. Observed temperature
   patterns in downstream reaches were most similar to the pre-harvest
   conditions at the fifth year post-harvest. Collectively, we offer a
   novel approach for assessing stream temperature regime change using
   multiple metrics that can improve our understanding of thermal effects
   downstream of timber harvest, taking in consideration idiosyncratic
   responses across sites and time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The reference conditions of Chlorophyll-a in lakes should be established
   in order to improve the water quality in these water bodies. A new
   method using segmental linear regression was developed to estimate the
   reference condition of Chlorophyll-a. The method can overcome the
   shortcomings of other methods, such as the quantile-selection-based
   method, which contains a certain level of subjectivity. The new method
   was used to estimate the annual reference condition of Chlorophyll-a in
   Taihu Lake. The log-log segmental regression results indicate that the
   distribution of specific volume (reciprocal of concentration) of
   Chlorophyll-a in Taihu Lake had a power-law tail. Both segmental
   regression and bootstrap approaches show two credible change points in
   the power-law relationship. This study's analysis shows that the value
   of 4.4 mg.m(-3) was an appropriate annual reference value of
   Chlorophyll-a in Taihu Lake. Thus, the method would be useful in
   determining the numerical reference conditions of Chlorophyll-a for
   other shallow lakes.}},

Abstract = {{Seagrass decline is often related to eutrophication, with sudden and
   drastic losses attributed to tipping points in nutrient loads. The
   identification of these threshold loads is an important step in the
   sustainable management of nutrient discharges. In this study, a novel
   methodological approach is presented to simulate the spatial and
   temporal dynamics of coastal nitrogen loads and its relationship with
   seagrass loss. The analysis allows the identification of nitrogen
   thresholds associated with the loss of Posidonia and Amphibolis spp. in
   Adelaide, South Australia. The identified thresholds varied between 0.8
   and 1.1 t N km(-2) over 6 months and explained up to 95\% of all
   seagrass losses in the region. Posidonia spp. was predominantly lost
   nearshore, indicating a threshold for this species in the higher end of
   the values reported here. In contrast, Amphibolis spp. were selectively
   lost further offshore, suggesting a lower threshold for the onset of
   fragmentation and decline. Nitrogen pressure was concentrated over the
   wetter months of the year between late autumn and early spring. Pulsed
   pressure peaking in August likely affected thresholds by reducing
   resilience in the system. Synthesis and applications. This study
   derives, for the first time, nitrogen load thresholds for the loss of
   the seagrasses Posidonia and Amphibolis spp., highlighting the low
   tolerance of these keystone temperate species to nitrogen pressure. The
   methodology developed as part of the work provides a tool to inform
   planning and improved management of nutrient discharges from land to

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{694-715}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Timely detection of ecological regime shifts is a key problem for
   ecosystem managers, because changed ecosystem dynamics and function will
   usually necessitate a change in management strategies. However,
   currently available methods for detecting regime shifts depend on having
   multiple long time series data from both before and after the regime
   shift. This data requirement is prohibitive for many ecosystems. Here,
   we present a new approach for detecting regime shifts from
   one-dimensional spatial (transect) data from just a single time step
   either side of the transition. Characteristic length scale (CLS)
   estimation is a method of attractor reconstruction combined with
   nonlinear prediction that enables identification of the emergent scale
   at which deterministic behavior of the system is best observed.
   Importantly, previous studies show that a fundamental change in
   ecosystem dynamics, from one domain of attraction to another, is
   reflected in a change in the CLS, i.e., the approach enables
   distinguishing regime shifts from variability in dynamics around a
   single attractor. Until now the method required highly resolved
   two-dimensional spatial data, but here we adapted the approach so that
   the CLS can be estimated from one-dimensional transect data. We
   demonstrate its successful application to both model and real ecosystem
   data. In our model test cases, we detected change in the CLS in cases
   where the shape (topology) of the interaction network had changed,
   leading to a shift in community composition. In an examination of
   benthic transect data from four Indonesian coral reefs, changes in the
   CLS for two of the reefs indicate a regime shift. This new development
   in estimating CLSs makes it possible to detect regime shifts in systems
   where data are limited, removing ambiguity in the interpretation of
   community change.}},

Abstract = {{Abrupt climate change may cause heat, drought, and flood disasters. In
   this study, we find that many climate factors {[}e.g., the East Asian
   summer monsoon (EASM), the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the Pacific
   decadal oscillation (PDO)] show a decadal-scale abrupt change in the
   1970s. To analyze this phenomenon thoroughly, a new method of pedigree
   clustering combined with phase-space analysis (PCPSA) is used to
   establish two-dimensional phase-space coordinate systems of EASM-AO,
   EASM-PDO, and AO-PDO and the three-dimensional phase-space coordinate
   system of EASM-AO-PDO. By using the PCPSA method, it is found that all
   of the phase-space coordinate systems have a significant abrupt change
   in the mid-1970s, with a transition period, and the fit to the abrupt
   change of the phase-space coordinate system is better than 80\%, which
   indicates excellent fit. By analyzing the correlation of EASM, AO, and
   PDO with sea level pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperature (SST), it
   is found that SLP has an obvious weakening trend in the high latitudes
   and an increasing trend in the tropics while SST has an increasing trend
   in most of the Southern Hemisphere waters and a minor weakening trend in
   the North Pacific Ocean waters between 30 degrees and 40 degrees N.
   Therefore, the abrupt climate change of the 1970s may well be a global
   abrupt change of the climatic system.}},

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{1. Recent advances in biologging have resulted in animal location data
   at unprecedentedly high temporal resolutions, sometimes many times per
   second. However, many current methods for analysing animal movement
   (e.g. step selection analysis or state-space modelling) were developed
   with lower-resolution data in mind. To make such methods usable with
   high-resolution data, we require techniques to identify features within
   the trajectory where movement deviates from a straight line.
   2. We propose that the intricacies of movement paths, and particularly
   turns, reflect decisions made by animals so that turn points are
   particularly relevant to behavioural ecologists. As such, we introduce a
   fast, accurate algorithm for inferring turning-points in high-resolution
   data. For analysing big data, speed and scalability are vitally
   important. We test our algorithm on simulated data, where varying
   amounts of noise were added to paths of straight-line segments
   interspersed with turns. We also demonstrate our algorithm on data of
   free-ranging oryx Oryx leucoryx. We compare our algorithm to existing
   statistical techniques for break-point inference.
   3. The algorithm scales linearly and can analyse several
   hundred-thousand data points in a few seconds on a mid-range desktop
   computer. It identified turnpoints in simulated data with complete
   accuracy when the noise in the headings had a standard deviation of +/-
   8 degrees, well within the tolerance of many modern biologgers. It has
   comparable accuracy to the existing algorithms tested, and is up to
   three orders of magnitude faster.
   4. Our algorithm, freely available in R and Python, serves as an initial
   step in processing ultra high-resolution animal movement data, resulting
   in a rarefied path that can be used as an input into many existing
   step-and-turn methods of analysis. The resulting path consists of points
   where the animal makes a clear turn, and thereby provides valuable data
   on decisions underlying movement patterns. As such, it provides an
   important breakthrough required as a starting point for analysing
   subsecond resolution data.}},

Title = {{Ecosystem Responses to Water Resource Developments in a Large Dryland
   River}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{Large floodplain rivers in dryland regions are becoming increasingly
   modified through water resource developments. Identifying ecosystem
   responses in these systems is challenging because of their natural
   variability, limited data, and the myriad of ways they are modified.
   This study used organic samples from snail, mussel, and fish specimens
   obtained from museum collections for the determination of carbon and
   nitrogen stable isotope ratios, for the Barwon-Darling River, Australia,
   between 1869 and 2005, a period of extensive water development. Three
   hypotheses were posed for this study: (1) The trophic status and food
   web character of the Barwon-Darling River will change in response to
   water resource developments; (2) responses in the trophic status and
   food web character will differ between different hydrogeomorphic zones
   identified along the river; and (3) food chain lengths will increase in
   response to water resource developments. Substantive changes in trophic
   status and components of the food web were detected between before and
   after water developments. Three lines of evidence support the conclusion
   of anthropogenically driven changes in the food web of this dryland
   floodplain-river system. Stable isotope ratios of fish, mussels, and
   snails differed between both hydrogeomorphic zones of the river and the
   before and after disturbance periods. Layman metrics, representing
   community niche space, differed between before and after disturbance
   periods. Also, both mean trophic position and food chain length differed
   between predisturbance and postdisturbance for the two functional
   process zones. The substantial shift in basal source contribution over
   time is a potential indicator of a state change and loss of resilience
   in this system.
   Plain Language Summary Resilience is the ability to absorb shocks and
   retain a normal functioning. This study indicates a loss of resilience
   in the aquatic ecosystem of the Barwon-Darling River as a result of
   water resource developments. A novel approach of using museum specimens
   of molluscs and fish enabled the trophic status and food web character
   over a 130-year period to be investigated, for the Barwon-Darling River,
   Australia, a system heavily impacted by water resource development.
   Marked differences in the trophic status and components of the food web
   were detected between before and after water resource development
   periods as indicated by the stable isotope ratios of the molluscs and
   fish. However, differences varied between two river zones. Food chain
   lengths increased but were greater in the upper river zone. Basal source
   contributions to the food web also changed substantially over time in
   association with water resource development. A flip to pelagic basal
   source dominance suggests the loss of resilience of this river system
   and potential regime shift.}},

Abstract = {{Microbes rarely exist in isolation, rather, they form intricate
   multi-species communities that colonize our bodies and inserted medical
   devices. However, the efficacy of antimicrobials is measured in clinical
   laboratories exclusively using microbial monocultures. Here, to
   determine how multi-species interactions mediate selection for
   resistance during antibiotic treatment, particularly following drug
   withdrawal, we study a laboratory community consisting of two microbial
   pathogens. Single-species dose responses are a poor predictor of
   community dynamics during treatment so, to better understand those
   dynamics, we introduce the concept of a dose-response mosaic, a
   multi-dimensional map that indicates how species' abundance is affected
   by changes in abiotic conditions. We study the dose-response mosaic of a
   two-species community with a `Gene x Gene x Environment x Environment'
   ecological interaction whereby Candida glabrata, which is resistant to
   the antifungal drug fluconazole, competes for survival with Candida
   albicans, which is susceptible to fluconazole. The mosaic comprises
   several zones that delineate abiotic conditions where each species
   dominates. Zones are separated by loci of bifurcations and tipping
   points that identify what environmental changes can trigger the loss of
   either species. Observations of the laboratory communities corroborated
   theory, showing that changes in both antibiotic concentration and
   nutrient availability can push populations beyond tipping points, thus
   creating irreversible shifts in community composition from
   drug-sensitive to drug-resistant species. This has an important
   consequence: resistant species can increase in frequency even if an
   antibiotic is withdrawn because, unwittingly, a tipping point was passed
   during treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive phosphorus (P) inputs to plastic-covered greenhouse vegetable
   production (PGVP) in China has led to excessive soil P accumulation
   increasing the potential for leaching to surface waters. This study
   examined the mobility and hence the potential risk of P losses through
   correlations between soil solution P (PRA) and soil extractable P as
   determined by conventional soil P test methods (STPs) including degree
   of P saturations (DPSs), and diffusive gradient in thin-films (DGT P)
   technique. A total of 75 topsoil samples were chosen from five
   representative Chinese PGVPs covering a wide range of physiochemical
   soil properties and cultivation history. Total P and Olsen P contents
   varied from 260 to 4900, and 5 to 740 mg kg(-1), respectively, while
   P-Sol concentrations were between 0.01 and 10.8 mg L-1 reflecting the
   large differences in vegetation history, fertilization schemes, and soil
   types. Overall, DGT P provided the best correlation with P-SoL (r(2) =
   0.97) demonstrating that DGT P is a versatile measure of P mobility
   regardless of soil type. Among the DPSs tested, oxalate extractable Al
   (DPSOx-Al) had the best con-elation with P-Sol ( (r(2) = 0.87). In the
   STP versus P-Sol relationships, STP break-points above which P
   mobilization increases steeply were 513 mu g L-1 and 190 mg kg(-1) for
   DGT P or Olsen P, respectively, corresponding to P-Sol concentration of
   0.88 mg L-1. However, for P-Sol concentration of 0.1 mg L-1 that
   initiates eutrophication, the corresponding DGT P and Olsen P values
   were 27 mu g L-1 and 22 mg kg(-1), respectively. Over 80\% of the
   investigated soils had DGT P and Olsen P above these values, and thus
   are at risk of P mobilization threatening receiving waters by
   eutrophication. This paper demonstrates that the DGT extracted P is a
   powerful measure for soluble P and hence for assessment of P mobility

Abstract = {{To study the evolution of several quantitative traits, the classical
   phylogenetic comparative framework consists of amultivariate random
   process running along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. The
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process is sometimes preferred to the simple
   Brownian motion (BM) as it models stabilizing selection toward an
   optimum. The optimum for each trait is likely to be changing over the
   long periods of time spanned by large modern phylogenies. Our goal is to
   automatically detect the position of these shifts on a phylogenetic
   tree, while accounting for correlations between traits, which might
   exist because of structural or evolutionary constraints. We show that,
   in the presence of shifts, phylogenetic Principal Component Analysis
   fails to decorrelate traits efficiently, so that any method aiming at
   finding shifts needs to deal with correlation simultaneously. We
   introduce here a simplification of the full multivariate OU model, named
   scalar OU, which allows for noncausal correlations and is still
   computationally tractable. We extend the equivalence between the OU and
   a BMon a rescaled tree to our multivariate framework. We describe an
   Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that allows for a maximum
   likelihood estimation of the shift positions, associated with a new
   model selection criterion, accounting for the identifiability issues for
   the shift localization on the tree. The method, freely available as an
   R-package (PhylogeneticEM) is fast, and can deal withmissing values. We
   demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy compared to another
   state-of-the-art method (l1ou) on a wide range of simulated scenarios

Abstract = {{Estimating temperature extremes (TEs) and associated uncertainties under

   interpretable. For instance, to predict a high return level (RL) in a
   future year, time-varying distributions must be used and compared. This
   study examines the performance of a new concept to predict RLs in an NS
   context and compares three methods for constructing the associated CIs
   (delta, profile likelihood, and parametric bootstrap). The present work
   takes up the concept of integrated return periods that define the T-year
   RL as the level for which the expected number of events in a T-year
   period is one and proposes a new method based on conditional predictions
   that is useful for predicting high RLs of extreme events in the near
   future (the 100-year RL in the year 2030, for instance). The daily
   maximum temperature (DMT) observed at the Orange Station in France was
   used as a case study. Several trend models were compared and a new
   likelihood-based method to detect breaks in TEs is proposed. The
   analyses were conducted assuming the time-varying Generalized Extreme
   Value (GEV) distribution. The concepts have been implemented in a
   software package (Non-Stationary Generalized Extreme Value (NSGEV)). The
   application demonstrates that the RL estimates for NS situations can be
   quite different from those corresponding to stationary conditions.
   Overall, the results suggest that the NS analysis can be helpful in
   making a more appropriate assessment of the risk for periodic safety
   reviews during the life of a nuclear power plant (NPP).}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel approach to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution
   of regional cooling across the eastern United States (commonly called
   the U.S. warming hole), by defining a spatially explicit boundary around
   the region of most persistent cooling. The warming hole emerges after a
   regime shift in 1958 where annual maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min)
   temperatures decreased by 0.83 degrees C and 0.46 degrees C,
   respectively. The annual warming hole consists of two distinct seasonal
   modes, one located in the southeastern United States during winter and
   spring and the other in the midwestern United States during summer and
   autumn. A correlation analysis indicates that the seasonal modes differ
   in causation. Winter temperatures in the warming hole are significantly
   correlated with the Meridional Circulation Index, North Atlantic
   Oscillation, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. However, the variability
   of ocean-atmosphere circulation modes is insufficient to explain the
   summer temperature patterns of the warming hole.
   Plain Language Summary
   The U.S. warming hole is a region in the eastern United States that
   experienced a broad decline in temperatures beginning in the late 1950s.
   The warming hole is fundamentally different than global temperature
   trends, which have been rising since 1880. There are several ideas as to
   why the warming hole exists, but most cannot fully explain the observed
   temperature patterns. Interestingly, there is also disagreement about
   the location and timing of the warming hole, which may add to the
   difficulty in diagnosing its cause. Here we analyze temperature patterns
   since 1901 and present a new way to define the location of the warming
   hole, thereby clarifying much of the variance in location described in
   previous studies. We find that temperatures in the warming hole are
   associated with changes in climate indices over the Pacific and Atlantic
   Oceans, which are likely related to changes in the waviness of the jet
   stream over the eastern United States. We find evidence that the jet
   stream exhibited a shift in the late 1950s coincident with the start of
   the warming hole, resulting in a greater tendency of northerly winds to
   bring cool air to the southern United States.}},

   deglaciation: Comparison between pollen and GDGT proxies}},
Journal = {{QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{182}},
Pages = {{78-92}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Our understanding of deglacial climate history in the southern Great
   Lakes region of the United States is primarily based upon fossil pollen
   data, with few independent and multi-proxy climate reconstructions. Here
   we introduce a new, well-dated fossil pollen record from Stotzel-Leis,
   OH, and a new deglacial temperature record based on branched glycerol
   dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) at Silver Lake, OH. We compare
   these new data to previously published records and to a regional stack
   of pollen-based temperature reconstructions from Stotzel-Leis, Silver
   Lake, and three other well-dated sites. The new and previously published
   pollen records at Stotzel-Leis are similar, but our new age model brings
   vegetation events into closer alignment with known climatic events such
   as the Younger Dryas (YD). brGDGT-inferred temperatures correlate
   strongly with pollen-based regional temperature reconstructions, with
   the strongest correlation obtained for a global soil-based brGDGT
   calibration (r(2) = 0.88), lending confidence to the deglacial
   reconstructions and the use of brGDGT and regional pollen stacks as
   paleotemperature proxies in eastern North America. However, individual
   pollen records show large differences in timing, rates, and amplitudes
   of inferred temperature change, indicating caution with paleoclimatic
   inferences based on single-site pollen records. From 16.0 to 10.0ka,
   both proxies indicate that regional temperatures rose by similar to 10
   degrees C, roughly double the similar to 5 degrees C estimates for the
   Northern Hemisphere reported in prior syntheses. Change-point analysis
   of the pollen stack shows accelerated warming at 14.0 +/- 1.2ka, cooling
   at 12.6 +/- 0.4ka, and warming from 11.6 +/- 0.5ka into the Holocene.
   The timing of Bolling-Allerod (B-A) warming and YD onset in our records
   lag by similar to 300-500 years those reported in syntheses of
   temperature records from the northern mid-latitudes. This discrepancy is
   too large to be attributed to uncertainties in radiocarbon dating, and
   correlation between pollen and brGDGT temperature reconstructions rules
   out vegetation lags as a cause. However, the YD termination appears
   synchronous among the brGDGT record, regional pollen stack, and Northern
   Hemisphere stack. The cause of the larger and lagged temperature changes
   in the southern Great Lakes relative to Northern Hemisphere averages
   remains unclear, but may be due to the effects of continentality and ice
   sheet extent on regional climate evolution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{The Regime Shifts Database: a framework for analyzing regime shifts in
   social-ecological systems}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Regime shifts, i.e., large, persistent, and usually unexpected changes
   in ecosystems and social-ecological systems, can have major impacts on
   ecosystem services, and consequently, on human well-being. However, the
   vulnerability of different regions to various regime shifts is largely
   unknown because evidence for the existence of regime shifts in different
   ecosystems and parts of the world is scattered and highly uneven.
   Furthermore, research tends to focus on individual regime shifts rather
   than comparisons across regime shifts, limiting the potential for
   identifying common drivers that could reduce the risk of multiple regime
   shifts simultaneously. Here, we introduce the Regime Shifts Database, an
   open-access database that systematically synthesizes information on
   social-ecological regime shifts across a wide range of systems using a
   consistent, comparative framework, providing a wide-ranging information
   resource for environmental planning, assessment, research, and teaching
   initiatives. The database currently contains 28 generic types of regime
   shifts and > 300 specific case studies. Each entry provides a
   literature-based synthesis of the key drivers and feedbacks underlying
   the regime shift, as well as impacts on ecosystem services and human
   well-being, and possible management options. Across the 28 regime
   shifts, climate change and agriculture-related activities are the most
   prominent among a wide range of drivers. Biodiversity, fisheries, and
   aquatic ecosystems are particularly widely affected, as are key aspects
   of human well-being, including livelihoods, food and nutrition, and an
   array of cultural ecosystem services. We hope that the database will
   stimulate further research and teaching on regime shifts that can inform
   policy and practice and ultimately enhance our collective ability to
   manage and govern large, abrupt, systemic changes in the Anthropocene.}},

Abstract = {{The sustainability challenge requires various forms of experimentation
   with inventions, which may lead to an upscaling process in which the
   invention and its applications will spread to other users and regions in
   the world. However, many experiments fail. In this paper, we explore the
   success factors for sustahiability experiments in their contribution to
   a longer-term regime change. These factors are related to the experiment
   itself as well as to the habitat in which the experiment takes place. A
   habitat is regarded as a configuration of contextual factors, which are
   mainly locally or regionally embedded. We introduce complementary
   insights from transition management literature and regional innovation
   systems literature to hypothesise that various types of experiments have
   distinctive favourite habitats, each with their specific success
   factors. Our exploratory survey among 56 sustainability experiments
   throughout Europe in the area of food, mobility and energy innovation
   suggests that user involvement is the most important success factor.
   Other important factors are the cooperation in local and regional
   networks, the policy instruments from the local and regional government,
   the dissemination of learning experiences, and the existence of a local
   or regional vision of the future. We conclude that entrepreneurs, users,
   local and regional governments as well as other regional partners should

Abstract = {{This study examines the effect of autocorrelation on step and monotonic
   trends in seasonal and annual rainfall. Initially, for step change,
   modified-Pettitt test is applied in two ways. First, using the corrected
   and unbiased trend-free-pre-whitening (TFPWcu) approach. Second, using a
   new approach in which time series is modelled by intervention analysis
   for modified Pettitt test. Subsequently, for monotonic trends,
   Mann-Kendall (MK) and six approaches of modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) test
   are applied to NCDC data for period 1901-2012 and its sub-periods.
   Approaches of MMK include pre-whitening (PW), trend-free-pre-whitening
   (TFPW), TFPWcu, two Variance Correction Approaches (VCAs) based on
   empirical formula (VCA:CF1) and Monte-Carlo-Simulations (VCA:CF2) and
   long term persistence (MK-LTP). A single change point is identified in
   1970 for annual and monsoon rainfall from original and
   modified-Pettitt's test using TFPWcu, while time series modelling
   approach has not exhibited any change point. Process shift in rainfall
   series is also studied using CUSUM and multiple change points are
   identified using Segment-Neighbourhood method. Outcomes of MMK show that
   TFPWcu is able to efficiently limit the effect of autocorrelation and
   may be preferred over PW and TFPW. The VCA:CF2 is not dependent on whole
   autocorrelation structure and corrects variance of all data series using
   lag-1 autocorrelation and may be preferred over VCA:CF1. MK-LTP
   considers long term persistence and it has exhibited presence of weaker
   trends than exhibited by other approaches. VCA:CF2 and MK-LTP are used

Abstract = {{This paper is focused on the seasonality change of Arctic sea ice extent
   (SIE) from 1979 to 2100 using newly available simulations from the
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). A new approach to
   compare the simulation metric of Arctic SIE between observation and 31
   CMIP5 models was established. The approach is based on four factors
   including the climatological average, linear trend of SIE, span of
   melting season and annual range of SIE. It is more objective and can be
   popularized to other comparison of models. Six good models (GFDL-CM3,
   CESM1-BGC, MPI-ESM-LR, ACCESS-1.0, HadGEM2-CC, and HadGEM2-AO in turn)
   are found which meet the criterion closely based on above approach.
   Based on ensemble mean of the six models, we found that the Arctic sea
   ice will continue declining in each season and firstly drop below 1
   million km(2) (defined as the ice-free state) in September 2065 under
   RCP4.5 scenario and in September 2053 under RCP8.5 scenario. We also
   study the seasonal cycle of the Arctic SIE and find out the duration of
   Arctic summer (melting season) will increase by about 100 days under
   RCP4.5 scenario and about 200 days under RCP8.5 scenario relative to
   current circumstance by the end of the 21st century. Asymmetry of the
   Arctic SIE seasonal cycle with later freezing in fall and early melting
   in spring, would be more apparent in the future when the Arctic climate
   approaches to ``tipping point{''}, or when the ice-free Arctic Ocean
   appears. Annual range of SIE (seasonal melting ice extent) will increase
   almost linearly in the near future 30-40 years before the Arctic appears
   ice-free ocean, indicating the more ice melting in summer, the more ice
   freezing in winter, which may cause more extreme weather events in both
   winter and summer in the future years.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic network biomarkers (DNB) can identify the critical state or
   tipping point of a disease, thereby predicting rather than diagnosing
   the disease. However, it is difficult to apply the DNB theory to
   clinical practice because evaluating DNB at the critical state required
   the data of multiple samples on each individual, which are generally not
   available, and thus limit the applicability of DNB. In this study, we
   developed a novel method, i.e., single-sample DNB (sDNB), to detect
   early-warning signals or critical states of diseases in individual
   patients with only a single sample for each patient, thus opening a new
   way to predict diseases in a personalized way. In contrast to the
   information of differential expressions used in traditional biomarkers
   to ``diagnose disease{''}, sDNB is based on the information of
   differential associations, thereby having the ability to ``predict
   disease{''} or ``diagnose near-future disease{''}. Applying this method
   to datasets for influenza virus infection and cancer metastasis led to
   accurate identification of the critical states or correct prediction of
   the immediate diseases based on individual samples. We successfully
   identified the critical states or tipping points just before the
   appearance of disease symptoms for influenza virus infection and the
   onset of distant metastasis for individual patients with cancer, thereby
   demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our method for
   quantifying critical states at the single-sample level.}},

Abstract = {{Trend and change-point analyses of water quality time series data have
   important implications for pollution control and environmental
   decision-making. This paper developed a new approach to assess trends
   and change-points of water quality parameters by integrating locally
   weighted polynomial regression (LWPR) and segmented regression (SegReg).
   Firstly, LWPR was used to pretreat the original water quality data into
   a smoothed time series to represent the long-term trend of water
   quality. Then, SegReg was used to identify the long-term trends and
   change-points of the smoothed time series. Finally, statistical tests
   were applied to determine the significance of the long-term trends and
   change-points. The efficacy of this approach was validated using a
   10-year record of total nitrogen (TN) and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn)
   from Shanxi Reservoir watershed in eastern China. Results showed that
   this approach was straightforward and reliable for assessment of
   long-term trends and change-points on irregular water quality datasets.
   The reliability was verified by statistical tests and practical
   considerations for Shanxi Reservoir watershed. The newly developed
   integrated LWPR-SegReg approach is not only limited to the assessment of
   trends and change-points of water quality parameters but also has a
   broad application to other fields with long-term time series records.}},

Abstract = {{The success of high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for distinguishing

   gene corresponding to four Plasmodium species. Conserved 26-mer ssDNAs
   from ldh gene of the four Plasmodium species were employed as targets. A
   capture probe (CP) that is fully complementary to the Plasmodium
   falciparum target (FT) and has two base mismatches each, with the
   targets of Plasmodium vivax (VT), Plasmodium malariae, (MT), and
   Plasmodium ovale (OT), was considered. The DNA duplexes were treated
   with metal ions for structural perturbation and analyzed by HRM.
   Distinct resolution of melting fluorescence signal in otherwise
   identical HRM profiles for each of the DNA duplexes was achieved by
   using Ca+2 or Mg+2 ions, where, Ca+2 conferred higher resolution. The
   increase in resolution for CP-FT versus CP-OT, CP-FT versus CP-VT, CP-FT
   versus CP-MT, CP-VT versus CP-OT, and CP-MT versus CP-OT with Ca-DNA as
   compared to control was 67.3-, 20.4-, 22.0-, 10.9-, and 8.3-fold,

   could detect 0.25 pmol/mu l of the target DNA. Structural analysis
   showed that Ca+2 and Mg+2 ions perturbed the structure of DNA. This
   perturbation helped to improve HRM signal resolution among DNA targets

   novel approach has potential application not only for Plasmodium

Abstract = {{Climate change and human activity are two major drivers that alter

Abstract = {{Marine ecosystems can undergo regime shifts, which result in
   nonstationarity in the dynamics of the fish populations inhabiting them.
   The assumption of time-invariant parameters in stock-recruitment models
   can lead to severe errors when forecasting renewal ability of stocks
   that experience shifts in their recruitment dynamics. We present a novel
   method for fitting stock-recruitment models using the Bayesian online
   change point detection algorithm, which is able to cope with sudden
   changes in the model parameters. We validate our method using
   simulations and apply it to empirical data of four demersal fishes in
   the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. We show that all of the stocks have
   experienced shifts in their recruitment dynamics that cannot be captured
   by a model that assumes time-invariant parameters. The detected shifts
   in the recruitment dynamics result in clearly different parameter
   distributions and recruitment predictions between the regimes. This
   study illustrates how stock-recruitment relationships can experience
   shifts, which, if not accounted for, can lead to false predictions about
   a stock's recovery ability and resilience to fishing.}},

Abstract = {{The annual growth of the Finnish forests has doubled in less than a
   century but the reasons for the increase have been a subject of much
   debate. Site index aggregates the mid- to long-term impacts of variable
   edaphic and climatic factors on site productivity and is an important
   characteristic with regard to the ongoing environmental changes. We
   quantified changes of site index in Finland over time by applying a new
   approach developed in our previous study in Germany. A large data base
   for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus
   sylvestris L) and larch (Larix spp.) was available from the network of
   long-term growth and yield experiments in southern and central Finland.
   For all tree species, site indices fluctuated over time, i.e. they
   slightly decreased in the 1970s, followed by an increasing trend in the
   1980s and a decline again in the 1990s. Apparently, the only significant
   change was a change point indicated for Scots pine around the year 1944;
   however, indication was weak due to notable limitations of the database
   during the respective period. Interestingly, the result of this study in
   Finland differs from central Europe, where Norway spruce site
   productivity has displayed a considerable increase since the 1950s.
   Potentially, the low nitrogen deposition in Finland may be of major
   importance accounting for the divergent changes in site productivity
   between Finland and central Europe. Thus, the results indicate that a
   large share of the growth increase in the Finnish forests might actually
   be due to altered management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Soil behavior can reflect the characteristics of principal stress
   rotation under dynamic wave and traffic loads. Unequal amplitudes of
   tensile and compressive stresses applied to soils have complex effects
   on foundation soils in comparison with the pure principal stress
   rotation path. A series of undrained cyclic hollow torsional shear tests
   were performed on typical remolded soft clay from the Ilexi area of
   Nanjing, China. The main control parameters were the tensile and
   compressive stress amplitude ratio (alpha) and the cyclic dynamic stress
   ratio (eta). It was found that the critical eta tended to remain
   constant at 0.13, when the value of the compressive stress amplitude was
   higher than the tensile stress amplitude. However, the influence of the
   tensile stress was limited by the dynamic stress level when alpha= 1.
   For obvious structural change in the soil, the corresponding numbers of
   cyclic vibration cycles were found to be independent of alpha at low
   stress levels and were only related to eta. Finally, a new method for
   evaluating the failure of remolded soft clay was presented. It considers
   the influence of the tensile and compressive stresses which caused by
   complex paths of the principal stress rotation. This criterion can
   distinguish stable, critical, and destructive states based on the
   pore-water-pressure-strain coupling curve while also providing a range
   of failure strain and vibration cycles. These results provide the
   theoretical support for systematic studies of principal stress rotation

Abstract = {{A series of estimates of the total mortality rate (Z) can be obtained by
   using the Beverton-Holt nonequilibrium-based approach of Gedamke and
   Hoenig (2006) on observations of population mean length over time (ML
   model). In contrast, only relative mortality rates (not absolute values)
   can be obtained from a time series of catch rates. We derived the
   transitional behavior of the catch rate following a change in total
   mortality in the population. From this derivation, we developed a
   new-method to estimate Z that utilizes both mean lengths and catch rates
   (MLCR model). Both theML model and the MLCR model assume constant
   recruitment in the population. We used a simulation study to test
   performance when recruitment is variable. Simulations over various
   scenarios of Z and recruitment variability showed that there may be
   correlated residuals in the mean lengths and catch rates arising from
   fluctuations in recruitment. However, the root mean square errors of the
   Z estimates and the change point (i.e., the year when mortality changed)
   were smaller in the MLCR model than in the ML model, indicating that the
   MLCR model can better account for variable recruitment. Both methods
   were then applied to Mutton Snapper Lutjanus analis in Puerto Rico to
   illustrate their potential application to assess data-limited stocks.
   The ML model estimated an increase in Z, but the MLCR model also
   estimated a subsequent reduction in Z when the catch rate data were

Journal = {{ECOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{131-143}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{There is mounting evidence that many taxa respond in non-linear ways to
   perturbation (i.e. deviations from a natural trajectory brought on by an
   external agent), and many statistical, physical and ecological methods
   have been developed to detect the critical points or thresholds of
   perturbation. The majority of these methods define thresholds as the
   perturbation points causing abrupt ecological response, but in reality
   most species or ecosystems do not show a break point response but more
   gradual transitional change to perturbation. We develop a new method
   which delineates thresholds as a region in which the slope of the
   relationship between ecological response (y) and perturbation (x; e.g.
   habitat loss) is larger than 1: vertical bar|dy/dx vertical bar >= 1,
   where both x-and y-axes are scaled to (0, 1) range. The lower end of
   threshold zones so defined is of particular ecological interest because
   it is the smallest x that may trigger impending catastrophic response to
   a small change in x. We derived two landscape models (edge length and
   the number of patches of species distribution) and two biodiversity
   models (endemics-area relationship and half-population curve) to test
   this method. We applied our zonal thresholding method to these four
   models fit to empirical data of two forest plots to detect thresholds of
   species distribution to habitat loss. The two landscape metric models
   predict that no species could tolerate more than 40\% of habitat loss
   and these thresholds can be much lower for relatively rare species with
   occupancy <0.4 and for aggregated habitat loss compared to random
   habitat loss. The half-population model leads to a similar threshold
   level of 40\% habitat loss. Overall, we suggest the maximum permissible
   habitat loss threshold to be between 0-40\%, depending on the
   pre-disturbed occupancy (or abundance) of a species. This habitat loss
   threshold falls within the otherwise wide range of thresholds calculated
   from conventional methods. Our study contributes novel methods and
   models to quantify the effect of habitat loss on species distribution
   and diversity in landscapes with potential for conservation
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Structure and dynamics are essential elements of protein function.
   Protein structure is constantly fluctuating and undergoing
   conformational changes, which are captured by molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations. We introduce a computational framework that provides a
   compact representation of the dynamic conformational space of
   biomolecular simulations. This method presents a systematic approach
   designed to reduce the large MD simulation spatiotemporal datasets into
   a manageable set in order to guide our understanding of how protein
   mechanics emerge from side chain organization and dynamic
   reorganization. We focus on the detection of side chain interactions
   that undergo rearrangements mediating global domain motions and vice
   versa. Side chain rearrangements are extracted from side chain
   interactions that undergo well-defined abrupt and persistent changes in
   distance time series using Gaussian mixture models, whereas global
   domain motions are detected using dynamic cross-correlation. Both side
   chain rearrangements and global domain motions represent the dynamic
   components of the protein MD simulation, and are both mapped into a
   network where they are connected based on their degree of coupling. This
   method allows for the study of allosteric communication in proteins by
   mapping out the protein dynamics into an intramolecular network to
   reduce the large simulation data into a manageable set of communities
   composed of coupled side chain rearrangements and global domain motions.
   This computational framework is suitable for the study of tightly packed
   proteins, such as G protein-coupled receptors, and we present an

Abstract = {{The Miocene epoch was a time of major change in the East African Rift
   System (EARS) as forest habitats were transformed into grasslands and
   hominids appeared in the landscape. Here we provide new sedimentological
   and palynological data on the middle-upper Miocene Ngorora Formation
   (Tugen Hills, Central Kenya Rift, EARS), together with clay mineral
   characterizations, mammal finds and a description of the Ngorora fish
   Lagerstatte. Furthermore, we introduce a revised age of c. 13.3 Ma for
   the onset of the Ngorora Formation. The older part of the Ngorora
   Formation (c. 13.3-12 Ma) records low-energy settings of lakes,
   floodplains and palaeosols, and evidence of analcime indicates that
   lakes were alkaline. The palynomorph spectrum consists of tree pollen
   (Juniperus, Podocarpus), Euphorbiaceae pollen (Acalypha, Croton) and
   herbaceous pollen of Poaceae and Asteraceae, suggestive of wooded
   grasslands or grassy woodlands. Alkaline lakes, floodplains and
   palaeosols continue upsection (c. 12-9 Ma), but environmental
   fluctuations become more dynamic. Paucity of palynomorphs and the
   presence of an equid may point to progressively drier conditions. A
   total of about 500 articulated fish fossils were recovered from
   distinctive layers of almost all sections studied and represent
   different lineages of the Haplotilapiines (Pseudocrenilabrinae,
   Cichlidae). Some of the fish kills may be attributable to rapid water
   acidification and/or asphyxiation by episodic ash falls. Repeated
   instances of abrupt change in water depth in many sections are more
   likely to be due to synsedimentary tectonic activity of the Central
   Kenya Rift than to climatic variation. Overall, the preservation of the
   Ngorora fish Lagerstatte resulted from the interplay of tectonics,
   formation of alkaline lakes and explosive volcanism. As records of
   grasslands that pre-date late Miocene time are rare, our finding of
   middle Miocene (12-13 Ma) grassy savannah in the Central Kenya Rift is
   also relevant to models of human evolution in East Africa.}},

Title = {{SwitchFinder - a novel method and query facility for discovering dynamic
   gene expression patterns}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biological systems and processes are highly dynamic. To gain
   insights into their functioning time-resolved measurements are
   necessary. Time-resolved gene expression data captures temporal
   behaviour of the genes genome-wide under various biological conditions:
   in response to stimuli, during cell cycle, differentiation or
   developmental programs. Dissecting dynamic gene expression patterns from
   this data may shed light on the functioning of the gene regulatory
   system. The present approach facilitates this discovery. The fundamental
   idea behind it is the following: there are change-points (switches) in
   the gene behaviour separating intervals of increasing and decreasing
   activity, whereas the intervals may have different durations.
   Elucidating the switch-points is important for the identification of
   biologically meanigfull features and patterns of the gene dynamics.
   Results: We developed a statistical method, called SwitchFinder, for the
   analysis of time-series data, in particular gene expression data, based
   on a change-point model. Fitting the model to the gene expression
   time-courses indicates switch-points between increasing and decreasing
   activities of each gene. Two types of the model - based on linear and on
   generalized logistic function -were used to capture the data between the
   switch-points. Model inference was facilitated with the Bayesian
   methodology using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique Gibbs
   sampling. Further on, we introduced features of the switch-points:
   growth, decay, spike and cleft, which reflect important dynamic aspects.
   With this, the gene expression profiles are represented in a qualitative
   manner - as sets of the dynamic features at their onset-times. We
   developed a Web application of the approach, enabling to put queries to
   the gene expression time-courses and to deduce groups of genes with
   common dynamic patterns.
   SwitchFinder was applied to our original data -the gene expression
   time-series measured in neuroblastoma cell line upon treatment with
   all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The analysis revealed eight patterns of
   the gene expression responses to ATRA, indicating the induction of the
   BMP, WNT, Notch, FGF and NTRK-receptor signaling pathways involved in
   cell differentiation, as well as the repression of the cell-cycle
   related genes.
   Conclusions: SwitchFinder is a novel approach to the analysis of
   biological time-series data, supporting inference and interactive
   exploration of its inherent dynamic patterns, hence facilitating
   biological discovery process. SwitchFinder is freely available at
   https://newbioinformatics.eu/switchfinder.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the P-wave velocities indifferent directions of sandstone
   samples under uniaxial compression are measured. The results indicate
   that the changes in the P-wave velocity in different directions are
   almost the same. In the initial stage of loading, the P-wave velocity
   exhibits a rising trend due to compaction and closure of preexisting
   fissures. As the stress increase, preexisting fissures are closed but
   induced fractures are not yet generated. The sandstone samples become
   denser and more uniform. The P-wave velocity remains in a steady state
   at a high level. In the late stage of loading, the P-wave velocity drops
   significantly due to the expansion and breakthrough of induced
   fractures. The P-wave velocity anisotropy index epsilon is analyzed
   during the process of loading. It can be observed that the change in the
   degree of wave velocity anisotropy can be divided into three stages: the
   AB stage, the BC stage and the CD stage, with a changing trend from
   decline to incline. In the initial stage of loading, the preexisting
   fissures have a randomized distribution, and the change is large-scale
   and uniform. The difference in each spatial point decreases gradually,
   and synchronization increases gradually. Thus, the P-wave velocity
   anisotropy declines. As the stress increases gradually, with the
   expansion and breakthrough of induced fractures, the difference in each
   spatial point increases. Before failure of rock samples, the violent
   change region of the rock samples' internal structure is focused on a
   narrow two-dimensional zone, and the rock samples' structural change is
   obviously local. Therefore, the degree of velocity anisotropy rises
   after declining, and it also has good corresponding relation among the
   AE count, the location of AE events and the degree of wave velocity
   anisotropy. The projection plane of the main fracture plane on the axis
   plane is recorded as M plane. Based on the AFF equation, for the CD
   stage, we analyze the quantitative relationship between the velocity
   anisotropy index epsilon and angle theta, which is the difference
   between the angle of the M plane and the X plane and the angle of the M
   plane and the Y plane from the theoretical point. The results indicate
   that 1/epsilon and cot theta/2 have good negative linear relationship
   that can be expressed as cot cot theta/2 = a{*}1/epsilon+b. According to
   experimental data, the linear fit of 1/epsilon and cot theta/2 is found,
   obtaining cot theta/2 = -0.04721 1/epsilon + 0.03, with a linear fit
   index of 0.908. From an experimental point of view, the linear
   relationship between 1/epsilon and cot theta/2 is verified. Through this
   research, we propose a new method for quantitatively predicting the main
   fracture occurrence position by P-wave velocity anisotropy. This work
   has an important significance for understanding buckling failure of
   rocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The climate system is a classical spatiotemporal evolutionary dynamic
   system with spatiotemporal correlation characteristics. Based on this,
   two-dimensional detrended fluctuation analysis (TD-DFA) is used to
   estimate the Hurst exponent of two-dimensional images. Then, we
   monitored the change of the Hurst exponent of the images to identify an
   abrupt dynamic change. We tested the performance of this method with a
   coupled spatiotemporal dynamic model and found that it works well. The
   changes in the Hurst exponents of the spatial images are stable when
   there is no dynamic change in the system, but there will be a clear
   non-stationary change of the Hurst exponents; for example, the abrupt
   mean values change if the dynamics of the system change. Thus, the
   TD-DFA method is suitable for detecting an abrupt dynamic change from
   natural and artificial images. The spatial images of the NCEP reanalysis
   of the daily average temperature exhibited fractality. Based on this, we
   found three non-stationary changes in the Hurst exponents for the NCEP
   reanalysis of the daily average temperature or for the annual average
   temperature in the region (60A degrees S-60A degrees N). It can be
   concluded that the climate system may have incurred three dynamic
   changes since 1961 on decadal timescales, i.e., in approximately the

Abstract = {{Natural hydrological regimes are essential to the stability of river
   basins. While numerous efforts have been put forth to characterize flow
   regime alterations driven by climate change and human activities, few
   approaches have been proposed to explore changes in watershed
   resilience. The present study attempted to introduce a systematic
   approach that can be used to identify the resilience change of river
   basins based on annual river discharge through the application of a
   convex model and the principle of critical slowing down. Specifically, a
   resilience indicator (p(1)) that reflects streamfiow autocorrelation at
   a given time was proposed to represent the temporal variation of the
   system resilience, and annual water discharge at representative
   hydrological stations located in upstream, midstream, and downstream
   regions of a river basin was used to reflect alterations in long-term
   hydrological processes and the stability of river basins. The
   application of this method to the Yellow River basin and Yangtze River
   basin indicated that the system resilience was lower in downstream
   regions compared to upstream regions. The Yellow River basin has
   suffered a decrease in resilience in its lower reaches since 1971, which
   extended to the middle reaches in 1987 and upper reaches in 1990.
   Similarly, recent observation of the resilience change in the Yangtze
   River basin indicated that resilience in its lower reaches has likely
   decreased since 2002, and this low resilience extended to the middle
   reaches in 2005. Overall, our study presents a new method to predict

Abstract = {{Species composition and habitats are changing at unprecedented rates in
   the world's oceans, potentially causing entire food webs to shift to
   structurally and functionally different regimes. Despite the severity of
   these regime shifts, elucidating the precise nature of their underlying
   processes has remained difficult. We address this challenge with a new
   analytic approach to detect and assess the relative strength of
   different driving processes in food webs. Our study draws on complexity
   theory, and integrates the network-centric exponential random graph
   modelling (ERGM) framework developed within the social sciences with
   community ecology. In contrast to previous research, this approach makes
   dear assumptions of direction of causality and accommodates a dynamic
   perspective on the emergence of food webs. We apply our approach to
   analysing food webs of the Baltic Sea before and after a previously
   reported regime shift. Our results show that the dominant food web
   processes have remained largely the same, although we detect changes in
   their magnitudes. The results indicate that the reported regime shift
   may not be a system-wide shift, but instead involve a limited number of
   species. Our study emphasizes the importance of community-wide analysis
   on marine regime shifts and introduces a novel approach to examine food

Title = {{Quantitative Estimation of the Impact of Precipitation and Land Surface
   Change on Hydrological Processes through Statistical Modeling}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Precipitation variability and land surface changes are the two primary
   factors that affect basin hydrology, and thus estimation of their impact
   is of great importance for sustainable development at a catchment scale.
   In this study, we investigated the long-term changes in precipitation
   and runoff, from 1961 to 2011, in the Yihe River basin by Mann-Kendall
   test. A new method of trend pattern was put forward and used to identify
   the trends of precipitation and runoff, which indicated that the basin
   had a decreasing trend in annual runoff. The change point occurred in
   the year 1985 dividing the long-term series into two periods.
   Precipitation elasticity and linear regression methods were used to
   quantify the impact of precipitation and land surface change on runoff
   and provided consistent results of the percentage change in an annual
   runoff for the postchange period. Use of these methods reveals that the
   reduction in annual runoff is mainly due to precipitation variability of
   56.38-67.68\% and land surface change of 43.62-32.32\%, as estimated by
   precipitation elasticity and linear regression methods, respectively.
   Due to the rapid growth of urbanization, the land surface change
   increased from 1990 to 2010. The result of this study can provide a
   reference for the management of regional water resources.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{172}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Mapping deforestation using medium spatial resolution satellite data
   (e.g. Landsat) is increasingly shifting from decadal and annual scales
   to sub-annual scales in recent years, but this shift has brought new
   challenges on how to account for seasonality in the satellite data when
   detecting deforestation. A seasonal model is typically used to account
   for seasonality, but fitting a seasonal model is difficult when there
   are not enough data in the time series. Here, we propose a new approach
   that reduces seasonality in satellite image time series using spatial
   context. With this spatial context approach, each pixel value in the
   image is spatially normalised using the median value calculated from
   neighbouring pixels whose pixel values are above the 90th percentile.
   Using Landsat data, we compared our spatial context approach to a
   seasonal model approach at a humid tropical forest in Brazil and a thy
   tropical forest with strong seasonality in Bolivia. After reducing
   seasonal variations in Landsat data, we detected deforestation from the
   same data using the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) method.
   We show that, in dry tropical forest, deforestation events are detected
   much earlier when the spatial context approach is used to reduce
   seasonal variations in Landsat data than when a seasonal model is used.
   In the dry tropical forest, the median temporal detection delay for
   deforestation from the spatial context approach was two observations,
   seven times shorter than the median temporal detection delay from the
   seasonal model approach (15 observations). In the humid tropical forest,
   the difference in the temporal detection delay between the spatial
   context and seasonal model approach was not significant. The differences
   in overall spatial accuracy between the spatial context and seasonal
   model were also not significant in both dry and humid tropical forests.
   The main benefit for using spatial context is early detection of
   deforestation events in forests with strong seasonality. Therefore, the
   spatial context approach we propose here provides opportunity to monitor
   deforestation events in dry tropical forests at sub-annual scales using
   Landsat data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Progressive and insidious cognitive decline that interferes with daily
   life is the defining characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   Epidemiological studies have found that the pathological process of AD
   begins years before a clinical diagnosis is made and can be highly
   variable within a given population. Characterizing cognitive decline in
   the preclinical phase of AD is critical for the development of early
   intervention strategies when disease-modifying therapies may be most
   effective. In the last decade, there has been an increased interest in
   the application of change-point models to longitudinal cognitive
   outcomes prior to and after diagnosis. Most of the proposed statistical
   methodology for describing decline relies upon distributional
   assumptions that may not hold. In this article, we introduce a quantile
   regression with a change-point model for longitudinal data of cognitive
   function in persons bound to develop AD. A change-point in our model
   reflects the transition from the cognitive decline due to normal aging
   to the accelerated decline due to disease progression. Quantile
   regression avoids common distributional assumptions on cognitive
   outcomes and allows the covariate effects and the change-point to vary
   for different quantiles of the response. We provided an approach for
   estimating the model parameters, including the change-point, and
   presented inferential procedures based on the asymptotic properties of
   the estimators. A simulation study showed that the estimation and
   inferential procedures perform reasonably well in finite samples. The
   practical use of our model was illustrated by an application to
   longitudinal episodic memory outcomes from two cohort studies of aging
   and AD.}},

Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{The progression and clonal development of tumors often involve
   amplifications and deletions of genomic DNA. Estimation of
   allele-specific copy number, which quantifies the number of copies of
   each allele at each variant loci rather than the total number of
   chromosome copies, is an important step in the characterization of tumor
   genomes and the inference of their clonal history. We describe a new
   method, falcon, for finding somatic allele-specific copy number changes
   by next generation sequencing of tumors with matched normals. falcon is
   based on a change-point model on a bivariate mixed Binomial process,
   which explicitly models the copy numbers of the two chromosome
   haplotypes and corrects for local allele-specific coverage biases. By
   using the Binomial distribution rather than a normal approximation,
   falcon more effectively pools evidence from sites with low coverage. A
   modified Bayesian information criterion is used to guide model selection
   for determining the number of copy number events. Falcon is evaluated on
   in silico spike-in data and applied to the analysis of a pre-malignant
   colon tumor sample and late-stage colorectal adenocarcinoma from the

   falcon allows us to draw detailed conclusions regarding the clonal

Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Resilience in dynamic ecological systems has been intuitively associated
   with the ability to withstand disturbances in system drivers represented
   as shocks. Typically shocks are characterized as instantaneous, and
   isolated non-interacting events with the system dynamics corresponding
   to a fixed potential well. However, ecological systems are subject to
   continuous variation in environmental drivers such as rainfall,
   temperature, etc. and these interact with the ecosystem dynamics to
   alter the potential well. These variations are typically represented as
   a stochastic process. Furthermore, with climate change, the stochastic
   characteristics of the environmental drivers also change, thereby
   impacting the well dynamics. To characterize the resilience behavior
   under continuous variation in system drivers, and contrast it with that
   subject to instantaneous shock in system drivers, we employ the
   canonical catastrophic shift system as an example, and demonstrate
   emergent and contrasting divergent resilience behavior of the measures
   as the properties of the system-driver couple change. These behaviors
   include variability induced stabilization or enhancement of dynamic
   regimes, regions of sensitivity to dynamic regime transitions and
   existence of trap or escape regions. Furthermore, we introduce the
   concept of iso-resilience curves which are employed to design travel
   paths in resilience landscapes. These results provide valuable insights
   for managing resilience attributes associated with dynamic regime
   transitions in catastrophic shift systems under instantaneous shock and

Abstract = {{Major applications of RNA-seq data include studies of how the

   tools have been developed to analyze RNA-seq data, these generally have
   limited efficacy for annotating 3' UTRs. Existing assembly strategies
   often fragment long 3' UTRs, and importantly, none of the algorithms in
   popular use can apportion data into tandem 3' UTR isoforms, which are
   frequently generated by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA).
   Consequently, it is often not possible to identify patterns of
   differential APA using existing assembly tools. To address these
   limitations, we present a new method for transcript assembly, Isoform
   Structural Change Model (IsoSCM) that incorporates change-point analysis
   to improve the 3' UTR annotation process. Through evaluation on
   simulated and genuine data sets, we demonstrate that IsoSCM annotates 3'

   with existing methods. We highlight the utility of IsoSCM by
   demonstrating its ability to recover known patterns of tissue-regulated

Pages = {{3046-3055}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Regime shifts are often used to describe sharp changes between two or
   more ecological states, each characterized by their own dynamics,
   stochastic fluctuations, or cycles. Ecological theory indicates they can
   occur either as a result of an abrupt environmental forcing (extrinsic
   regime shift), or be indicative of complex responses to local-scale
   dynamics and thresholds (intrinsic regime shift). One important area of
   ecological research is to develop quantitative tools to analyze regime
   shifts, but there are few studies that have applied these methods to the
   long-term ecological record. In this study, we introduce a framework to
   investigate regime shifts in diatom assemblages and mangrove ecosystem
   dynamics in a coastal lagoon from the Galapagos Islands over the past
   2600 years. The framework integrates a set of established statistical
   methodologies for investigating regime shift dynamics in long-term
   ecological records. We use these methods to (1) identify the presence of
   regime shifts; (2) test for a series of hypothetical relationships
   (i.e., linear through to threshold) between ecological response and
   environment using nonlinear regression; and (3) investigate the relative
   importance of intrinsic and extrinsic dynamics in response to
   environmental perturbations. The transitions in the diatoms closely
   track the sequence of disturbance, recovery, and habitat shifts that
   have occurred in the lagoon over the past 2600 years, demonstrating
   extrinsic responses to environmental forcing. In contrast, the shift
   from a mangrove-to a microbial mat-dominated system; 945 cal yr BP
   provides potential evidence of an intrinsic regime shift. Our framework
   enables robust interpretations into the underlying dynamics of regime
   shifts in the paleoecological record and is widely applicable for
   investigating abrupt ecological changes in a range of systems.}},

Abstract = {{To prevent lake degradation, water level management has been a major
   focus of research in the past several decades. There are, however, some
   shortcomings in the traditional studies, and the protection of entire
   ecosystems is difficult to achieve in practice. In this paper, the
   framework of a new method for determining ecosystem-based water level
   regimes (WLRs) for lake protection is proposed. First, historical WLRs
   are divided into several sub-stages. Then, ecosystem statuses
   corresponding to different WLRs are quantified and compared. Finally,
   parameters of optimal and acceptable WLRs are used to determine water
   level management goals. The proposed method was applied to Baiyangdian
   Lake, the largest shallow lake in the North China Plain, to test its
   effectiveness. Results showed that to protect the ecosystem at the
   optimal status, 50\% of the parameter values should fall within the
   range of the 25th and 75th percentiles of Stage I; and to protect the
   ecosystem from reverse succession, 50\% of the water level parameter
   values should fall within the range of the 25th and 75th percentiles of
   Stage II. This method takes ecosystem status into account, and has high
   practicability in water resources management.}},

Abstract = {{Matching molecular series (MMS) have originally been introduced as an
   extension of the matched molecular pair (MMP) concept to facilitate the
   design of substructure-based structure-activity relationship (SAR)
   networks. An MMP is defined as a pair of compounds that only differ by a
   structural change at a single site. In addition, an MMS is defined as an
   MMP-based series of compounds that have a conserved structural core and
   are distinguished by modifications at a single site. Systematic
   generation of MMS from specifically active compounds generalizes the
   search for series of structural analogs. Potency-ordered MMS provide
   series associated with SAR information. We have systematically extracted
   MMS from publicly available compounds with well-defined activity
   measurements and generated a large database with approx. 40000 single-
   and 13600 multi-target series, which provide a rich source of SAR
   information. As an application, we introduce MMP-based mapping of
   screening hits to MMS to search for initial SAR information and
   determine all SAR environments available for such hits. The MMS database

Abstract = {{Massive changes to ecosystems sometimes cross thresholds from which
   recovery can be difficult, expensive and slow. These thresholds are
   usually discovered in post hoc analyses long after the event occurred.
   Anticipating these changes prior to their occurrence could give managers
   a chance to intervene. Here we present a novel approach for anticipating
   ecosystem thresholds that combines resilience indicators with Quickest
   detection of change points. Unlike existing methods, the Quickest
   detection method is updated every time a data point arrives, and
   minimizes the time to detect an approaching threshold given the users'
   tolerance for false alarms. The procedure accurately detected an
   impending regime shift in an experimentally manipulated ecosystem. An
   ecosystem model was used to determine if the method can detect an
   approaching threshold soon enough to prevent a regime shift. When the
   monitored variable was directly involved in the interaction that caused
   the regime shift, detection was quick enough to avert collapse. When the
   monitored variable was only indirectly linked to the critical
   transition, detection came too late. The procedure is useful for
   assessing changes in resilience as ecosystems approach thresholds.
   However some thresholds cannot be detected in time to prevent regime
   shifts, and surprises will be inevitable in ecosystem management.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to develop techniques to evaluate soil
   phosphorus (P) sorption capacity (PSC) and determine critical soil P
   levels to predict P loss potential for calcareous soils. Seventy-five
   soils mostly from Northern China were analyzed for soil P using four
   extraction methods (water, P-w; carbonate, P-Ols; ammonium oxalate,
   P-ox; and Mehlich 3, P-M3) as well as PSC derived from single-point
   (PSC150) and multipoint sorption (S (t)) isotherms. Strong correlation
   was found between PSC150 and S (t) (r (2)=0.89, p < 0.001). The sum of
   alpha Ca-M3 and beta Mg-M3 as an index of PSC (PSC(CaM3 + MgM3)) was
   most closely related to the maximum amount of P sorbed (S (max)) as
   given by the sum of S (t) and soil initial P setting alpha=0.039 and
   beta=0.462 (r (2)=0.80, p < 0.001). The degree of P saturation (DPS) was
   thereafter calculated from PSC(CaM3 + MgM3) (DPS(CaM3 + MgM3)), to which
   Olsen P (P-Ols) was significantly correlated (r (2)=0.82, p < 0.001). In
   a split-line regression from P-w against DPS(CaM3 + MgM3) (r (2)=0.87, p
   < 0.05), a change point was identified at 28.1\% DPS(CaM3 + MgM3), which
   was equivalent to 49.2 mg kg(-1) P-Ols and corresponded to a P-w
   concentration of 8.8 mg kg(-1). After the change point, a sharp increase
   in P-w was observed. Our results reveal a new approach to approximating
   DPS from Ca-M3 and Mg-M3 for calcareous soils without the need to
   generate a S (max). We conclude that in the absence of an environmental
   soil test criteria for P, the DPS(CaM3 + MgM3) and P-Ols could be used
   to predict P loss potential from calcareous soils.}},

Pages = {{1911-1919}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: As well-known, aerial firefighting is an effective
   solution suppressing forest fire, however there is no doubt, this tool
   in many cases can be the only one effective solution, even if it is very
   expensive. Following the above idea, any new method that is able to
   reduce the cost of aerial means supporting forest fire management, is
   worth examining as a new aerial solution. Methods: This article used
   practical experiments of the aerial firefighting, created a graphics
   model to understand the logistic problem, made assumptions to
   concentrate on the key problems and with mathematical backgrounds some
   logistic functions meaning distance and capacity axes. Results and
   discussion: The effectiveness of air tankers depends on the distance
   between the fire zone and water resource. The shorter the distance is
   between them, the higher the effectiveness is using aerials. This
   relation can be shown even at a function; however the change is not
   linear. The rate of the curve depends on the distance, larger distance
   means smaller change and vice versa, shorter distance means bigger scale
   of change. This result gives the tipping point where the higher costs of
   suggested solution - aerial water supply system will be balanced by the
   higher amount of bombed water.}},

Abstract = {{Dravet syndrome (DS) is an intractable genetic epilepsy caused by
   loss-of-function mutations in SCN1A, the gene encoding brain sodium

   Here we correlate the time course of declining expression of the murine

   adult sodium channel Na(v)1.1 with susceptibility to epileptic seizures
   and increased incidence of sudden death in DS mice. Parallel studies

   Na(v)1.3 and increase in Na(v)1.1 with age. In light of these results,
   we introduce the hypothesis that the natural loss Na(v)1.3 channel

Abstract = {{An abrupt change occasionally occurs when the dynamical system suddenly
   shifts from one stable state to a new state, which can take place in
   many complex systems, such as climate, ecosystem, social system, and so
   on. In order to detect abrupt change, this article presents a novel
   method - sliding transformation parameter (STP) on the basis of skewness
   change and the Box-Cox transformation. Tests on model time series and
   1000 simulated daily precipitation data show the ability of the present
   method to identify and detect abrupt change of probability density
   function. The applications of STP in daily precipitation data show that
   there is an abrupt climate change between 1979 and 1980 in the selected
   observational stations, which is almost the same with the result
   obtained by approximate entropy (ApEn). Furthermore, it is found that
   the sample sizes of sliding windows have some influence on the Lambda
   parameter of the Box-Cox transformation, but it does not significantly
   affect the varying trend of the parameter and the identification of the
   change point in annual or interannual time scale. Comparing STP with the
   coefficient of skewness and kurtosis, ApEn, and some statistics
   approaches (e.g. percentiles and annual maxima), we find that the
   performance of the present method is much better than that of these

Abstract = {{Food web responses to species loss have been mostly studied in binary
   food webs, thus without accounting for the amount of energy transferred
   in consumer resource interactions.
   We introduce an energetic criterion, called extinction threshold, for
   which a species goes secondarily extinct when a certain fraction of its
   incoming energy is lost. We study the robustness to random node loss of
   10 food webs based on empirically-derived weightings. We use different
   extinction scenarios (random removal and from most- to least-connected
   species), and we simulate 10(5) replicates for each extinction threshold
   to account for stochasticity of extinction dynamics.
   We quantified robustness on the basis of how many additional species
   (i.e. secondary extinctions) were lost after the direct removal of
   species (i.e. primary extinctions). For all food webs, the expected
   robustness linearly decreases with extinction threshold, although a
   large variance in robustness is observed. The sensitivity of robustness
   to variations in extinction threshold increases with food web species
   richness and quantitative unweighted link density, while we observed a
   nonlinear relationship when the predictor is food web connectance and no
   relationship with the proportion of autotrophs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Multiple testing models have become an important part of statistical
   applications. Typically they can be presented as having M hypotheses
   each of which concerns an individual parameter. In addition to testing
   each of these hypotheses, there is often a desire to obtain interval
   estimates for the parameters. The use of stepwise procedures arises
   because single-step procedures are extremely conservative. Unfortunately
   research into the construction of useful, computationally feasible
   interval estimates corresponding to stepwise procedures has been slow.
   We present an alternative method of constructing multiple testing
   procedures (MTPs) that easily admits corresponding interval estimates.
   The new method places greater focus on each hypothesis separately while
   still using all the data. This method is particularly effective in the
   dependent case. Not only do these new MTPs perform as well as commonly
   used stepwise procedures but they also have a practical interval
   property not usually shared by stepwise procedures. That is, acceptance
   regions have desirable convexity properties. Furthermore, interval
   estimates associated with these tests are easily obtained. In addition,
   these intervals (i) are typically shorter than those based on the
   Bonferroni, Scheffe', Tukey or Dunnett method when they are applicable,
   (ii) are less likely to contain the null point falsely than other
   methods do, (iii) are informative, i.e. they are all finite in the
   two-sided case, unlike some constructed by other methods which often are
   infinite, (iv) have a form of the interval property.}},

   analysis in tumour samples}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: SNP arrays output two signals that reflect the total genomic
   copy number (LRR) and the allelic ratio (BAF), which in combination
   allow the characterisation of allele-specific copy numbers (ASCNs).
   While methods based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been extended
   from array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) to jointly handle
   the two signals, only one method based on change-point detection, ASCAT,
   performs bivariate segmentation.
   Results: In the present work, we introduce a generic framework for
   bivariate segmentation of SNP array data for ASCN analysis. For the
   matter, we discuss the characteristics of the typically applied BAF
   transformation and how they affect segmentation, introduce concepts of
   multivariate time series analysis that are of concern in this field and
   discuss the appropriate formulation of the problem. The framework is
   implemented in a method named CnaStruct, the bivariate form of the
   structural change model (SCM), which has been successfully applied to
   transcriptome mapping and aCGH.
   Conclusions: On a comprehensive synthetic dataset, we show that
   CnaStruct outperforms the segmentation of existing ASCN analysis
   methods. Furthermore, CnaStruct can be integrated into the workflows of
   several ASCN analysis tools in order to improve their performance,
   specially on tumour samples highly contaminated by normal cells.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands are important hydrological elements of watersheds that
   influence water storage, surface water runoff, groundwater
   recharge/discharge processes, and evapotranspiration. Understanding the
   cumulative effect wetlands have on a watershed requires a good
   understanding of representative water-level fluctuations and storage
   characteristics associated with multiple wetlands across a region. We
   introduce a probabilistic approach based on frequency analysis of water
   levels in numerous geographically isolated wetlands across the mantled
   karst terrain of west-central Florida, in the Tampa Bay region. This
   approach estimates the probabilities, or percentage of time, that water
   levels in a wetland or upland groundwater wells are at or below a
   specific elevation. We applied this hydrologic characterization to 56
   wetlands in west-central Florida, and documented that standing water was
   present in the wetlands 61 \% of the time and that these wetlands were
   groundwater recharge zones at least 50 \% of the time over the 7 year
   study. Additionally, we demonstrated that various wetland types,
   classified according to vegetation community composition and structure,
   exhibit similar means, extremes and ranges in water-level behavior. We
   believe that this is the first paper to robustly quantify inundation
   frequency and recharge status in seasonally flooded wetlands at a
   regional scale. The analytical tool introduced in this manuscript could
   be used to detect, through changes in water-level frequency
   distribution, wetland hydrological response to different climatological
   or anthropogenic stressors. This tool is timely as changes in frequency
   distribution shape may provide early warnings of ecosystem regime
   change.}},

Abstract = {{There is a paucity of detailed and timely forest inventory information
   available for Canada's large, remote northern boreal forests. The
   Canadian National Forest Inventory program has derived a limited set of
   attributes from a Landsat-based land cover product representing circa
   year 2000 conditions. Of the required inventory attributes, forest
   vertical structure (e.g., tree height) is critical for terrestrial
   biomass and carbon modeling and to date, is unavailable for these remote
   areas. In this study, we develop a large-area, fine-scale (25 m) mapping
   solution to estimate tree height (mean, dominant, and Lorey's height)
   across Canada's northern forests by integrating lidar data (representing
   0.27\% of the study area), and Landsat imagery (representing 100\% of
   the study area), using a geometric-optical modeling technique. First,
   spectral mixture analysis (SMA) was used to extract image endmembers and
   generate fraction images. Second, lidar data were used to calibrate the
   inverted geometric-optical model by adjusting the model's three key
   fractional inputs: sunlit crown, sunlit background, and shade fraction,
   based upon the SMA derived images. The heterogeneity of the study area,
   spanning 2.16 million ha, made it challenging to directly and accurately
   decompose mixed Landsat image pixels into the canopy and background
   fractions used for the Li-Strahler geometric-optical model inversion. As
   a result we developed a novel method to use the lidar plot data to
   facilitate the calculation of these fractions in an accurate and
   automated manner. The average estimation errors for mean, dominant, and
   Lorey's height were 4.9 m, 4.1 m, and 4.7 m, respectively when compared
   to the lidar data, with the best result achieved using dominant tree
   height, where the average error was 3.5 m for over 80\% of the forested
   area. Using this approach of optical remotely sensed data calibrated and
   validated with lidar height estimates, we generate and evaluate
   wall-to-wall estimates of tree height that can subsequently be used as
   inputs for biomass and carbon modeling. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

   approximate entropy (ApEn) can provide some information such as a single
   time-instant of abrupt dynamic change, but both of them cannot exactly
   detect all of the abrupt change regions. Some traditional methods, such
   as moving t-test, Cramer method, MannKendall test and Yamamoto method,
   even cannot provide any information of abrupt dynamic change in these
   model time series. Meanwhile, results showed that windows sizes and
   strong noise have some less effect on the MC-DFA results. In summary,
   MC-DFA provides a reliable measure to detect the abrupt dynamic change
   in correlated time series, and perfectively make up the deficiencies of
   MDFA and ApEn. The applications in daily surface air pressure records
   further verify the validity of the present method. Copyright (c) 2011

Abstract = {{Caddisflys (order Trichoptera) construct elaborate protective shelters
   and food harvesting nets with underwater adhesive silk. The silk fiber
   resembles a nanostructured tape composed of thousands of nanofibrils
   (similar to similar to 120 nm) oriented with the major axis of the
   fiber, which in turn are composed of spherical subunits. Weaker lateral
   interactions between nanofibrils allow the fiber to conform to surface
   topography and increase contact area. Highly phosphorylated (pSX)4
   motifs in H-fibroin blocks of positively charged basic residues are
   conserved across all three suborders of Trichoptera. Electrostatic
   interactions between the oppositely charged motifs could drive
   liquidliquid phase separation of silk fiber precursors into a complex
   coacervates mesophase. Accessibility of phosphoserine to an
   anti-phosphoserine antibody is lower in the lumen of the silk gland
   storage region compared to the nascent fiber formed in the anterior
   conducting channel. The phosphorylated motifs may serve as a marker for
   the structural reorganization of the silk precursor mesophase into
   strongly refringent fibers. The structural change occurring at the
   transition into the conducting channel makes this region of special
   interest. Fiber formation from polyampholytic silk proteins in
   Trichoptera may suggest a new approach to create synthetic silk analogs

Abstract = {{A novel method for determining the degree of deacetylation of chitosan
   is described. This involves a two-abrupt-change of the refractive index
   of solutions. Principle of the method is that the sample reacts with
   excessive acid, and the excessive acid is measured by alkaline
   titration. The refractive index of an aqueous chitosan solution was
   monitored and recorded in the course of acid-base titration. This gives
   a titration curve having two inflexion points and the difference between
   the two points corresponds to the volume of base required to neutralize
   the ammonium groups. It was proved that flocculation did not interfere
   with the measurement. The method is found to be low-cost, precise, and
   easy to operate for industrial applications. The DD values of three
   chitosan samples obtained with this new method show good agreement with
   those yielded from H-1 NMR. Such a mechanism of refractive index
   monitoring should open up a new application in the field of

Abstract = {{Sudden changes caused by nonclimatic factors (inhomogeneities) usually
   affect instrumental time series of climate variables. To perform robust
   climate analyses based on observations, a proper identification of such
   changes is necessary. Here, an approach (named the ``GAHMDI{''} method,
   after its components and purpose) that is based on a genetic algorithm
   and hidden Markov models is proposed for detection of inhomogeneities
   caused by changes in the mean and variance. Simulated series and a case
   study (winter precipitation from a weather station located in Milan,
   Italy) are set up to compare GAHMDI with existing methodologies and to
   highlight its features. For the identification of a single changepoint,
   GAHMDI performs similarly to other methods (e.g., standard normal
   homogeneity test). However, for the identification of multiple
   inhomogeneities and changes in variance, GAHMDI returns better results
   than three widespread methods by avoiding overdetection. For future
   applications and research in the homogenization of climate datasets
   (temperature and precipitation) the use of GAHMDI is encouraged,
   preferably in combination with another detection procedure (e.g., the
   method of Caussinus and Mestre) when metadata are not available. Since
   GAHMDI is developed in the generic context of time series segmentation,
   it can be applied to series of generic variables-for instance, those
   related to economics, biology, and informatics.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we examined structural changes of actin filaments
   interacting with myosin visualized by quick freeze deep-etch replica
   electron microscopy (EM) by using a new method of image
   processing/analysis based on mathematical morphology.
   In order to quantify the degree of structural changes, two
   characteristic patterns were extracted from the EM images. One is the
   winding pattern of the filament shape (WP) reflecting flexibility of the
   filament, and the other is the surface pattern of the filament (SP)
   reflecting intra-molecular domain-mobility of actin monomers
   constituting the filament. EM images were processed by morphological
   filtering followed by box-counting to calculate the fractal dimensions
   for WP (D(WP)) and SP (D(SP)). The result indicates that D(WP) was
   larger than D(SP) irrespective of the state of the filament (myosin-free
   or bound) and that both parameters for myosin-bound filaments were
   significantly larger than those for myosin-free filaments. Overall, this
   work provides the first quantitative insight into how conformational
   disorder of actin monomers is correlated with the myosin-induced
   increase in flexibility of actin filaments along their length as
   suggested by earlier studies with different techniques. Our method is
   yet to be improved in details, but promising as a powerful tool for
   studying the structural change of protein molecules and their

   regime shifts were detected in phytoplankton, benthos, and fish in 1995,
   which was just after invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena spp.) became
   established in the bay in 1993-1994. Two independent methods were used
   to detect these shifts: 1) principal components analysis followed by a
   Regime Shift Detector test for a change point in the running mean of the
   first principal component scores and (2) measurements of significant
   difference between pre- and post-Dreissena ecosystem structure based on
   measures of Bray-Curtis community similarity. Although a statistically
   significant shift was not detected in the zooplankton community by
   itself, zooplankton variables were instrumental in the overall ecosystem
   shift, determined for the combined four communities. All 32 variables
   were ranked for their individual contribution to the difference between

Abstract = {{The time series of measurements of hydro-meteorological variables often
   suffer from imperfections such as missing data, outliers and
   discontinuities in the mean values. The discontinuity in the mean can be
   the effect of: instrumental offsets and of their corrections, of changes
   in the monitoring station or in the surrounding environment. If the
   discontinuities can be identified with a reasonable precision, a
   correction of the erroneous data can be made. Several authors have put
   their great effort into developing techniques to identify non-climatic
   inhomogeneities; the resulting statistical methods are especially
   effective when the series contains a single change point, while their
   performances decline when the series contains multiple change points or
   inhomogeneous segments (a portion of the series bounded by two
   complementary shifts). These limitations also affect the standard normal
   homogeneity test (SNHT), one of the most effective and widely applied
   tests. We present a composite method of homogeneity testing, standard
   normal homogenization composite method (SNHCM), including the SNHT as
   one component, which improves the SNHT performances with multiple change
   points and inhomogeneous segments. A number of comparisons among the new
   method, the SNHT and a powerful optimal segmentation method (OSM-CM),
   are illustrated in the paper. SNHCM demonstrates their performances in
   change-point detection similar to, or better than, the SNHT and very
   close to the OSM-CM. The SNHCM is effective in recognizing complex
   patterns of discontinuities, especially inhomogeneous segments, which
   represent a severe problem for SNHT; on the contrary, SNHT performs
   slightly better only when the series contains a single change point, but
   the difference between the two methods is negligible. Compared to the
   OSM-CM, SNHCM provides very similar performances, with some favourable
   features deriving from the fact that it is computationally lighter,
   simpler to implement, can easily handle very long series and is based on
   statistical hypothesis tests with a well-defined and adjustable

Abstract = {{Light exposure is a potentially powerful stress factor during in vivo
   optical microscopy studies. In yeast, the general transcription factor
   Msn2p translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to
   illumination. However, previous time-lapse fluorescence microscopy
   studies of Msn2p have utilized a variety of discrete exposure settings,
   which makes it difficult to correlate stress levels and illumination
   parameters. We here investigate how continuous illumination with blue
   light, corresponding to GFP excitation wavelengths, affects the
   localization pattern of Msn2p-GFP in budding yeast. The localization
   pattern was analyzed using a novel approach that combines wavelet
   decomposition and change point analysis. It was found that the Msn2p
   nucleocytoplasmic localization trajectories for individual cells exhibit
   up to three distinct and successive states; i) Msn2p localizes to the
   cytoplasm; ii) Msn2p rapidly shuttles between the cytoplasm and the
   nucleus; iii) Msn2p localizes to the nucleus. Many cells pass through
   all states consecutively at high light intensities, while at lower light
   intensities most cells only reach states i) or ii). This behaviour
   strongly indicates that continuous light exposure gradually increases
   the stress level over time, presumably through continuous accumulation
   of toxic photoproducts, thereby forcing the cell through a bistable
   region corresponding to nucleocytoplasmic oscillations. We also show
   that the localization patterns are dependent on protein kinase A (PKA)
   activity, i.e. yeast cells with constantly low PKA activity showed a
   stronger stress response. In particular, the nucleocytoplasmic
   oscillation frequency was found to be significantly higher for cells
   with low PKA activity for all light intensities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A tropical cyclone initialization method with an idealized
   three-dimensional bogus vortex of an analytic empirical formula is
   presented for the track and intensity prediction. The procedure in the
   new method consists of four steps: the separation of the disturbance
   from the analysis, determination of the tropical cyclone domain,
   generation of symmetric bogus vortex, and merging of it with the
   analysis data. When separating the disturbance field, an efficient
   spherical high-order filter with the double-Fourier series is used whose
   cutoff scale can be adjusted with ease to the horizontal scale of the
   tropical cyclone of interest. The tropical cyclone domain is determined
   from the streamfunction field instead of the velocities. The
   axisymmetric vortex to replace the poorly resolved tropical cyclone in
   the analysis is designed in terms of analytic empirical functions with a
   careful treatment of the upper-layer flows as well as the secondary
   circulations. The geopotential of the vortex is given in such a way that
   the negative anomaly in the lower layer is changed into positive anomaly
   above the prescribed pressure level, which depends on the intensity of
   the tropical cyclone. The geopotential is then used to calculate the
   tangential wind and temperature using the gradient wind balance and the
   hydrostatic balance, respectively. The inflow and outflow in the
   tropical cyclone are constructed to resemble closely the observed or
   simulated structures under the constraint of mass balance. The bogus
   vortex is merged with the disturbance field with the use of matching
   principle so that it is not affected except near the boundary of
   tropical cyclone domain. The humidity of the analysis is modified to be
   very close to the saturation in the lower layers near the tropical
   cyclone center. The balanced bogus vortex of the present study is
   completely specified on the basis of four parameters from the Regional
   Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) report and the additional two
   parameters, which are derived from the analysis data. The initialization
   method was applied to the track and the intensity (in terms of central
   pressure) prediction of the TCs observed in the western North Pacific
   Ocean and East China Sea in 2007 with the use of the Weather Research
   and Forecasting (WRF) model. No significant initial jump or abrupt
   change was seen in either momentum or surface pressure during the time
   integration, thus indicating a proper tropical cyclone initialization.
   Relative to the results without the tropical cyclone initialization and
   the forecast results of RSMC Tokyo, the present method presented a great
   improvement in both the track and intensity prediction.}},

   taxa with low occurrence frequencies or highly variable abundances,
   properties of the vast majority of taxa in community data sets. We
   introduce Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) to detect changes in
   taxa distributions along an environmental gradient over space or time,
   and assess synchrony among taxa change points as evidence for community
   thresholds.
   2. TITAN uses indicator species scores to integrate occurrence,
   abundance and directionality of taxa responses. It identifies the
   optimum value of a continuous variable, x, that partitions sample units
   while maximizing taxon-specific scores. Indicator z scores standardize
   original scores relative to the mean and SD of permuted samples along x,
   thereby emphasizing the relative magnitude of change and increasing the
   contributions of taxa with low occurrence frequencies but high
   sensitivity to the gradient. TITAN distinguishes negative (z-) and
   positive (z+) taxa responses and tracks cumulative responses of
   declining {[}sum(z-)] and increasing {[}sum(z+)] taxa in the community.
   Bootstrapping is used to estimate indicator reliability and purity as
   well as uncertainty around the location of individual taxa and community
   change points.
   3. Using two simulated data sets, TITAN correctly identified taxon and
   community thresholds in more than 99\% of 500 unique versions of each
   simulation. In contrast, multivariate change-point analysis did not
   distinguish directional taxa responses, resulting in much wider
   confidence intervals that in one instance failed to capture thresholds
   in 38\% of the iterations.
   4. Retrospective analysis of macroinvertebrate community response to a
   phosphorus gradient supported previous threshold estimates, although
   TITAN produced narrower confidence limits and revealed that several taxa
   declined at lower levels of phosphorus. Re-analysis of macroinvertebrate
   responses to an urbanization gradient illustrated disparate change
   points for declining (0.81-3.3\% urban land) and increasing (6.8-26.6\%)
   taxa, whereas the published threshold estimate (20-30\%) missed the
   declining-taxa threshold because it could not distinguish their
   synchronous decline from the gradual increase in ubiquitous taxa.
   5. Synthesis and applications. By deconstructing communities to assess
   synchrony of taxon-specific change points, TITAN provides a sensitive
   and precise alternative to existing methods for assessing community
   thresholds. TITAN has tremendous potential to inform conservation of
   rare or threatened species, develop species sensitivity models, identify
   reference conditions and to support development of numerical regulatory
   criteria.}},

Abstract = {{1. Certain classes of change in the characteristics of an ecosystem,
   labelled regime shifts, have been observed in marine and freshwater
   ecosystems world-wide. Few tools, however, have been offered to detect
   and identify regime shifts in time-series data.
   2. We use a novel approach based on tools taken from the world of
   statistics, and econometrics to examine the occurrence of a regime shift
   in the predatory zooplankton population of Lake Kinneret, Israel. The
   tools are a free-knot spline mean function estimation method and a
   Markov-switching vector autoregression model.
   3. Our approach detected, with high probability, the occurrence of a
   regime shift in the zooplankton population in the early to mid-1990s.
   This was in-line with expectations based on similar events observed in
   the lake.
   4. The suggested approach is a step forward from existing approaches in
   that it does not require any pre-determent of threshold values but
   rather relies on a hidden underlying stochastic process that yields
   probabilities of regime shifts. Thus, it can therefore be applied
   without introducing any prior biases into the analysis. The approach is,
   therefore, an objective method in detecting the likely occurrence of a
   regime shift.}},

   spawning times and survival rates. Using a nonlinear and partly
   parametric statistical model, temperature, strong winds, and the age

   hatchdates. Moreover, the interaction of both a climate regime shift and

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A novel approach of using variability as a major descriptive parameter
   for observational time series is adopted to investigate how southeastern
   African (Zimbabwe) summer rainfall may have been forced by the El Nio
   southern oscillation (ENSO) and/or the Indian Ocean dipole/zonal mode
   (IODZM), concurrently with the changing sea surface temperature (SST)
   background of the Indo-Pacific region. The period is from 1901 to 2007.
   Wavelet power spectrum and linear statistical analysis, including simple
   and partial correlation techniques, are utilized to achieve this end.
   The results reveal epochal changes in teleconnections and other
   statistical properties linking southeastern African rainfall variability
   to the Indo-Pacific SSTs. These epochs conspicuously exhibit the period
   around 1945/1946, 1960/1961, 1972/1973, and 1997/1998 as demarcating
   distinct systematic climate turning points during the century. The role
   of the 1976/1977 climate regime shift seems not to be that apparent but
   instead, 1960/1961 and 1997/1998 appear to be the major turning points,
   both in the teleconnections and Indo-Pacific SST temporal
   characteristics. From the early 1960s to 1997, as much as 28\% of the
   rainfall variability was linearly related to the IODZM while the ENSO
   hardly explained a quarter of this value. During this period, droughts
   are especially strongly connected to the positive IODZM events but
   insignificantly linked to El Nio, thus contradicting the conventional
   knowledge attributing most of regional rainfall suppression to the warm
   ENSO phase. However, the post 1997 epoch saw the reversal of the two
   climate modes' influences. ENSO influence evidently became activated,
   attaining the previously assumed dominant role which had proved elusive
   during the earlier epochs. But this increased ENSO control is attributed
   to only less than 12\% of the rainfall variance while IODZM seem to be
   largely decoupled from the local rainfall influencing processes by
   hardly explaining a drastically reduced 1\% of the rainfall variance.
   This transformation occurred despite of neither ENSO nor IODZM SST
   anomalies showing any statistically significant changes. As far as could
   be established, this epochal behavior may not be forced by the frequency
   and magnitude of ENSO and IODZM events but most probably by the slow
   processes inherent in the SST background, especially of the tropical
   Indian Ocean. Thus, the apparent simultaneous decoupling of the IODZM
   and coupling of the ENSO to the regional rainfall controlling mechanisms
   seems to be the result of the unprecedented warming of the intervening
   tropical western Indian Ocean SSTs in the last decade. Consequently, the
   knowledge of the states of epochal Indian Ocean SST background
   variability should be an important regional scientific issue, since
   these epochal variations may dictate the nature (and successful
   prediction) of interannual as well as decadal climate fluctuations over
   southeastern Africa.}},

Abstract = {{A goal of animal movement analysis is to reveal behavioural mechanisms

   Statistical analysis of movement data is complicated by the fact that

   data reflect behaviours that are themselves heterogeneous. Here, we
   model movement data as a subsampling of a continuous stochastic
   processes, and introduce the behavioural change point analysis (BCPA), a
   likelihood-based method that allows for the identification of
   significant structural changes. The BCPA is robust to gappiness and
   measurement error, computationally efficient, easy to implement and
   reveals structure that is otherwise difficult to discern. We apply the
   analysis to a GPS movement track of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus
   ursinus), revealing an unexpectedly complex diurnal behavioural profile,
   and demonstrate its robustness to the greater errors associated with the
   ARGOS tracking system. By informing empirical interpretation of movement

Abstract = {{Phylogeneticists have developed several statistical methods to infer
   recombination among molecular sequences that are evolutionarily related.
   Of these methods, Markov change-point models currently provide the most
   coherent framework. Yet, the Markov assumption is faulty in that the
   inferred relatedness of homologous sequences across regions divided by
   recombinant events is not independent, particularly for nonrecombinant
   sequences as they share the same history. To correct this limitation, we
   introduce a novel random tips (RT) model. The model springs from the
   idea that a recombinant sequence inherits its characters from an unknown
   number of ancestral full-length sequences, of which one only observes
   the incomplete portions. The RT model decomposes recombinant sequences
   into their ancestral portions and then augments each portion onto the
   data set as unique partially observed sequences. This data augmentation
   generates a random number of sequences related to each other through a
   single inferable tree with the same random number of tips. While
   intuitively pleasing, this single tree corrects the independence
   assumptions plaguing previous methods while permitting the detection of
   recombination. The single tree also allows for inference of the relative
   times of recombination events and generalizes to incorporate multiple
   recombinant sequences. This generalization answers important questions
   with which previous models struggle. For example, we demonstrate that a
   group of human immunodeficiency type 1 recombinant viruses from
   Argentina, previously thought to have the same recombinant history,
   actually consist of 2 groups: one, a clonal expansion of a reference
   sequence and another that predates the formation of the reference
   sequence. In another example, we demonstrate that 2 hepatitis B virus
   recombinant strains share similar splicing locations, suggesting a
   common descent of the 2 viruses. We implement and run both examples in a
   software package called StepBrothers, freely available to interested
   parties.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Both the excitability of a neuron's membrane, driven by active ion
   channels, and dendritic morphology contribute to neuronal firing
   dynamics, but the relative importance and interactions between these
   features remain poorly understood. Recent modeling studies have shown
   that different combinations of active conductances can evoke similar
   firing patterns, but have neglected how morphology might contribute to
   homeostasis. Parameterizing the morphology of a cylindrical dendrite, we
   introduce a novel application of mathematical sensitivity analysis that
   quantifies how dendritic length, diameter, and surface area influence
   neuronal firing, and compares these effects directly against those of
   active parameters. The method was applied to a model of neurons from
   goldfish Area II. These neurons exhibit, and likely contribute to,
   persistent activity in eye velocity storage, a simple model of working
   memory. We introduce sensitivity landscapes, defined by local
   sensitivity analyses of firing rate and gain to each parameter,
   performed globally across the parameter space. Principal directions over
   which sensitivity to all parameters varied most revealed intrinsic
   currents that most controlled model output. We found domains where
   different groups of parameters had the highest sensitivities, suggesting
   that interactions within each group shaped firing behaviors within each
   specific domain. Application of our method, and its characterization of
   which models were sensitive to general morphologic features, will lead
   to advances in understanding how realistic morphology participates in
   functional homeostasis. Significantly, we can predict which active
   conductances, and how many of them, will compensate for a given age- or
   development-related structural change, or will offset a morphologic
   perturbation resulting from trauma or neurodegenerative disorder, to
   restore normal function. Our method can be adapted to analyze any
   computational model. Thus, sensitivity landscapes, and the quantitative
   predictions they provide, can give new insight into mechanisms of
   homeostasis in any biological system.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term ecosystem changes, such as regime shifts, have occurred in

   is able to correct for auto-correlation within time-series by a process

   prewhitening. Shifts that were detected with both methods were termed
   robust. The STARS method detected shifts in relatively short time-series

   Shifts were generally well detected at the end of time-series, but
   further development of the method is needed to enhance its performance

Abstract = {{All instrumental climate records are affected by instrumentation changes
   and variations in sampling over time. While much attention has been paid
   to the problem of detecting ``change points{''} in time series, little
   has been paid to the statistical properties of climate signals that
   result after adjusting ({''}homogenizing{''}) the data-or to the effects
   of the irregular sampling and serial correlation exhibited by real
   climate records. These issues were examined here by simulating
   multistation datasets. Simple homogenization methods, which remove
   apparent artifacts and then calculate trends, tended to remove some of
   the real signal. That problem became severe when change-point times were
   not known a priori, leading to significant underestimation of real
   and/or artificial trends. A key cause is false detection of change
   points, even with nominally strict significance testing, due to serial
   correlation in the data. One conclusion is that trends in previously
   homogenized radiosonde datasets should be viewed with caution.
   Two-phase regression reduced but did not resolve this problem. A new
   approach is proposed in which trends, change points, and natural
   variability are estimated simultaneously. This is accomplished here for
   the case of incomplete data from a fixed station network by an
   adaptation of the ``iterative universal Kriging{''} method, which
   converges to maximum-likelihood parameters by iterative imputation of
   missing values. With careful implementation this method's trend
   estimates had low random errors and were nearly unbiased in these tests.
   It is argued that error-free detection of change points is neither
   realistic nor necessary, and that success should be measured instead by
   the integrity of climate signals.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: There is a growing literature on the detection of Horizontal
   Gene Transfer (HGT) events by means of parametric, non-comparative
   methods. Such approaches rely only on sequence information and utilize
   different low and high order indices to capture compositional deviation
   from the genome backbone; the superiority of the latter over the former
   has been shown elsewhere. However even high order k-mers may be poor
   estimators of HGT, when insufficient information is available, e.g. in
   short sliding windows. Most of the current HGT prediction methods
   require pre-existing annotation, which may restrict their application on
   newly sequenced genomes.
   Results: We introduce a novel computational method, Interpolated
   Variable Order Motifs (IVOMs), which exploits compositional biases using
   variable order motif distributions and captures more reliably the local
   composition of a sequence compared with fixed-order methods. For optimal
   localization of the boundaries of each predicted region, a second order,
   two-state hidden Markov model (HMM) is implemented in a change-point
   detection framework. We applied the IVOM approach to the genome of
   Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi CT18, a well-studied prokaryote in
   terms of HGT events, and we show that the IVOMs outperform
   state-of-the-art low and high order motif methods predicting not only
   the already characterized Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPI-1 to
   SPI-10) but also three novel SPIs (SPI-15, SPI-16, SPI-17) and other HGT
   events.}},

Abstract = {{This study assesses historic overbank alluvial sedimentation along a
   low-gradient reach of West Fork Black's Fork in the northern Uinta
   Mountains, Utah. In this previously glaciated setting, an alluvial
   floodplain that is approximately 400 in wide by 1500 in long has been
   modified by the combined effects of valley morphometry and the recent
   history of clear-cut logging during the late 19th and early 20th
   Centuries. To quantify the effects on sedimentation and flow conveyance,
   three natural streambank exposures were sampled and analyzed for nuclear
   bomb fallout Cs-137. The distribution of Cs-137 within the three
   profiles suggests that a remnant outwash terrace exerts a first-order
   control over the deposition of overbank alluvium. Upstream from a
   constriction in the floodplain caused by the terrace remnant, as much as
   40 cm of overbank alluvium has been deposited since the beginning of
   clear-cut logging. Immediately downstream of that constriction, no
   evidence exists for any overbank sedimentation during that same period.
   Vibracore samples and Oakfield soil probe sampling throughout the study
   reach quantified the geographic extent and thicknesses of the historic
   alluvial package. Flood conveyance through the study area was modeled
   using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers HEC-RAS modeling program. Model
   simulations were run for modem conditions (using surveyed topography)
   and for prehistoric conditions (using the modem topography less the
   historic alluvial package determined by Cs-137 analyses). Model results
   indicate that the floodplain constriction caused a significant
   impediment to flood conveyance at even modest discharges during
   prehistoric conditions. This promoted ponding of floodwaters upstream of
   the constriction and deposition of alluvium. This has increased bank
   heights upstream of the constriction, to the point that under modem
   conditions 1 - to 5-year recurrence interval floods are largely confined
   within the channel. These results confirm the validity of this new
   approach of combining Cs-137 dating of alluvial sediments with HEC-RAS
   flow modeling to compare flood conveyance along a single stream reach
   prior to and since an abrupt change in alluvial sedimentation patterns.

Abstract = {{In its final report, An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century, the U. S.
   Commission on Ocean Policy, created by the Oceans Act of 2000, strongly
   endorsed regional scale, ecosystem-based management of coastal/ocean
   areas. To advance such an approach the Commission made numerous
   recommendations, including suggestions for both structural change in
   government and also for change in policy. As mandated by Congress, the
   process leading to the ultimate issuance of the Commission's final
   report specifically allowed for state governors to comment on a
   preliminary version of that report. The Commission was then to take
   those comments into account before issuing its final report. Thus, state
   governors were given a rare opportunity to indicate their preferences
   and concerns on the totality of U. S. coastal/ocean governance efforts.
   It is clear that implementation of the Commission's recommendations will
   require political support from the states, both in terms of encouraging
   the Administration and Congress to adopt change and in ensuring required
   federal-state cooperation. Accordingly, it is of great importance to
   understand the views of the states on the issues addressed by the

Abstract = {{Anomalous climate is often regulated by the annual cycle. Based on this
   physical consideration, we propose a new method termed as Season-reliant
   Empirical Orthogonal Function (S-EOF) analysis to detect major modes of
   climate variability. The S-EOF analysis of Indo-Pacific SST during the
   past 54 years reveals two statistically significant leading modes, which
   are not obtainable by using conventional EOF analysis. These modes
   represent the Indo-Pacific Low-Frequency (LF) and Quasi-Biennial (QB)
   modes associated ENSO, and reveal the fundamental differences between
   the LF and QB modes in their seasonal evolution, fractional variance
   structure, and interdecadal variation and trend. The interdecadal
   variability is coupled with the LF mode, suggesting that
   decadal-interdecadal SST variation is primarily represented by the
   ENSO-like interdecadal regime shift in the late 1970s. A warming trend
   is mingled with the QB mode, accounting for a large portion of the local
   SST variability in the Maritime Continent-western Pacific horseshoe

Abstract = {{A novel approach to bio-macromolecular design from a linear algebra
   point of view is introduced. A protein's total (whole protein) and local
   (one or more amino acid) linear indices are a new set of
   bio-macromolecular descriptors of relevance to protein QSAR/QSPR
   studies. These amino-acid level biochemical descriptors are based on the
   calculation of linear maps on R-n{[}f(k)(x(mi)) : R-n -> R-n] in
   canonical basis. These bio-macromolecular indices are calculated from
   the k (th) power of the macromolecular pseudograph alpha-carbon atom
   adjacency matrix. Total linear indices are linear functional on R-n.
   That is, the k (th) total linear indices are linear maps from R-n to the
   scalar R{[}f (k)(x(m)) : Rn -> R]. Thus, the k th total linear indices
   are calculated by summing the amino-acid linear indices of all amino
   acids in the protein molecule. A study of the protein stability effects
   for a complete set of alanine substitutions in the Arc repressor
   illustrates this approach. A quantitative model that discriminates near
   wild-type stability alanine mutants from the reduced-stability ones in a
   training series was obtained. This model permitted the correct
   classification of 97.56\% (40/41) and 91.67\% (11/12) of proteins in the
   training and test set, respectively. It shows a high Matthews
   correlation coefficient (MCC = 0.952) for the training set and an MCC =
   0.837 for the external prediction set. Additionally, canonical
   regression analysis corroborated the statistical quality of the
   classification model (R-canc = 0.824). This analysis was also used to
   compute biological stability canonical scores for each Are alanine
   mutant. On the other hand, the linear piecewise regression model
   compared favorably with respect to the linear regression one on
   predicting the melting temperature (t(m)) of the Are alanine mutants.
   The linear model explains almost 81\% of the variance of the
   experimental t(m) (R = 0.90 and s = 4.29) and the LOO press statistics
   evidenced its predictive ability (q(2) = 0.72 and s(cv) = 4.79).
   Moreover, the TOMOCOMD-CAMPS method produced a linear piecewise
   regression (R = 0.97) between protein backbone descriptors and tm values
   for alanine mutants of the Arc repressor. A break-point value of 51.87
   degrees C characterized two mutant clusters and coincided perfectly with
   the experimental scale. For this reason, we can use the linear
   discriminant analysis and piecewise models in combination to classify
   and predict the stability of the mutant Arc homodimers. These models
   also permitted the interpretation of the driving forces of such folding
   process, indicating that topologic/topographic protein backbone
   interactions control the stability profile of wild-type Arc and its
   alanine mutants. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method has been developed to improve protein-crystal perfection
   during crystallization in a high magnetic field and structural studies
   have been undertaken. The three-dimensional structure of orthorhombic
   hen egg-white (HEW) lysozyme crystals grown in a homogeneous and static
   magnetic field of 10 T has been determined and refined to a resolution
   of 1.13 Angstrom and an R factor of 17.0\%. The 10 T crystals belonged
   to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 56.54 (3), b
   = 73.86 (6), c = 30.50 (2) Angstrom and one molecule per asymmetric
   unit. A comparison of the structures of the 0 T and 10 T crystals has
   been carried out. The magnitude of the structural changes, with a
   root-mean-square deviation value of 0.75 Angstrom for the positions of
   all protein atoms, is similar to that observed when an identical protein
   structure is resolved in two different crystalline lattices. The
   structures remain similar, with the exception of a few residues e.g.
   Arg68, Arg73, Arg128 and Gln121. The shifts of the arginine residues
   result in very significant structural fluctuations, which can have large
   effects on a protein's crystallization properties. The high magnetic
   field contributed to an improvement in diffraction intensity by (i) the
   displacement of the charged side chains of Arg68 and Arg73 in the
   flexible loop and of Arg128 at the C-terminus and (ii) the removal of
   the alternate conformations of the charged side chains of Arg21, Lys97
   or Arg114. The improvement in crystal perfection might arise from the
   magnetic effect on molecular orientation without structural change and
   differences in molecular interactions. X-ray diffraction and
   molecular-modelling studies of lysozyme crystals grown in a 10 T field
   have indicated that the field contributes to the stability of the
   dihedral angle. The average difference in conformational energy has a
   value of -578 U mol(-1) per charged residue in favour of the crystal
   grown in the magnetic field. For most protein atoms, the average B
   factor in the 10 T crystal shows an improvement of 1.8 Angstrom(2) over
   that for the 0 T control; subsequently, the difference in diffraction
   intensity between the 10 T and 0 T crystals corresponds to an increase
   of 22.6\% at the resolution limit. The mosaicity of the 10 T crystal was
   better than that of the 0 T crystal. More highly isotropic values of
   0.0065, 0.0049 and 0.0048degrees were recorded along the a, b and c
   axes, respectively. Anisotropic mosaicity analysis indicated that
   crystal growth is most perfect in the direction that corresponds to the
   favoured growth direction of the crystal, and that the crystal grown in
   the magnetic field had domains that were three times the volume of those
   of the control crystal. Overall, the magnetic field has improved the
   quality of these crystals and the diffracted intensity has increased
   significantly with the magnetic field, leading to a higher resolution.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of changes in long-term phenological time series is a
   prerequisite for the analysis and interpretation of phenological
   observations as bio-indicator of climate change. The new method for the
   analysis of phenological time series based on Bayesian concepts,
   recently presented by DOSE and MENZEL (2004), is employed to the
   analysis of three long term observational flowering records in Germany
   (1900-2003) as well as of a 600 year record of cherry flowering in
   Kyoto, Japan. The onset of these phenological phases in relation to
   reported temperature variations is discussed, considering three
   different models for function estimation: The one-change-point-model is
   preferred in all data sets to the less sophisticated alternatives, the
   linear model and the constant model. The three time series covering the
   20(th) century at Geisenheim have a clear maximum of change point
   probability mid of the 1980s; the record from Kyoto spanning the last 6
   centuries has a broad maximum at the beginning of the 20(th) century.
   After these maxima, the resulting rates of change indicate advancing
   onset of flowering, reaching - with a considerable uncertainty range -
   higher rates at Geisenheim (up to -1.7 days/year in 2003) compared to
   Kyoto (-0.1 days/year in 1998). Thus, our analysis allows us to quantify
   these shifts in phenological phases, which turn out to be strongly
   dependent on spring temperature. Consequently, they mirror the marked
   temperature rise in the 20(th) century (Kyoto), especially its
   enhancement in the last 2-3 decades as reflected by the Geisenheim time

Abstract = {{The most plausible origin of HIV-1 group M is an SIV lineage currently
   represented by SIVcpz isolated from the chimpanzee subspecies Pan
   troglodytes troglodytes. The origin of HIV-1 group 0 is less clear.
   Putative recombination between any of the HIVA-1 and SlVcpz sequences
   was tested using bootscanning and Bayesian-scanning plots, as well as a
   new method using a Bayesian multiple change-point (BMCP) model to infer
   parental sequences and crossing-over points. We found that in the case
   of highly divergent sequences, such as HIV-1/SIVcpz, Bayesian scanning
   and BMCP methods are more appropriate than bootscanning analysis to
   investigate spatial phylogenetic variation, including estimating the
   boundaries of the regions with discordant evolutionary relationships and
   the levels of support of the phylogenetic clusters under study.
   According to the Bayesian scanning plots and BMCP method, there was
   strong evidence for discordant phylogenetic clustering throughout the
   genome: (1) HIV-1 group 0 clustered with SIVcpzANT/ TAN in middle pol,
   and partial vif/env; (2) SIVcpzGab1 clustered with SIVcpzANT/TAN in
   3'pol/vif, and middle env; (3) HIV-1 group 0 grouped with SIVcpzCamUS
   and SIVcpzGab1 in pl7/p24; (4) HIV-1 group M was more closely related to
   SIVcpzCamUS in 3'gag/pol and in middle pol, whereas in partial gp120
   group M clustered with group O. Conditionally independent phylogenetic
   analysis inferred by maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods
   further confirmed these findings. The discordant phylogenetic
   relationships between the HIV-1/SlVcpz sequences may have been caused by
   ancient recombination events, but they are also due, at least in part,
   to altered rates of evolution between parental SIVcpz lineages.}},

   the sampling distribution of the data as if the curve was unconstrained.
   We then propose to use Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to draw
   samples from the unconstrained model space and retain only those samples
   for which the monotonic constraint holds. The proportion of the samples
   collected for which the constraint holds can be used to provide a value
   for the weight of evidence in terms of Bayes factors for monotonicity
   given the data. Using the samples, probability statements can be made
   about other quantities of interest such as the number of change points

   into account not only the composition biases but also the overdispersion
   effects among the blocks. The new approach is tested on the families of

Abstract = {{DNA plasmid molecules modified with the antitumor drug cisplatin were
   imaged using dynamic force microscopy (DFM) in liquids. We have studied
   the positions of DNA kinks defined as points of abrupt change of the
   direction of the DNA double helix axis. The jumps of the direction were
   found using a method developed earlier for the idealization of
   electrical current through single ion channels (1). Raw AFM data were
   compensated for drift by joining adjacent scan lines of the image at
   flat portions of the sample surface. The quality of the reconstituted
   image is characterized quantitatively by an order parameter that
   describes the image wobble remaining after drift elimination. A new
   method for obtaining the molecule direction (central line) from contours
   of equal height based on the determination of central positions of
   circles inscribed between the inner and the outer contours of the
   molecule has been developed, leading to effective decrease of noise and
   drift. The positions of kinks are in good agreement with results of
   immediate analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy ion radiation (high linear energy transfer, LET, radiation)
   induces various types of chromosome aberration. In this report, we
   describe a new method employing an atomic force microscope (AFM) for
   nanometer-level structural analysis of chromosome damage induced by
   heavy ion irradiation. Metaphase mouse chromosomes with chromatid gap or
   chromatid breaks induced by heavy ion irradiation were marked under a
   light microscope. Then the detailed structure of chromosomes of
   Giemsa-stained or unstained samples was visualized by the AFM. The
   height data of chromosomes obtained by AFM provided useful information
   to distinguish chromatid gaps and breaks. A fibrous structure was
   observed on the unstained chromosome, the average width of which was
   about 45.8 nm in the image of AFM. These structures were considered to
   be 30-nm fibers on the chromosome. The structure of the break point
   regions induced by neon- or carbon-ion irradiation was imaged by AFM. In
   some cases, the fibrous structure of break points was detected by AFM
   imaging after carbon ion irradiation. These observations indicated that
   AFM is a useful tool for analysis of chromosome aberrations induced by
   heavy ion radiation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method is described, which uses changes in NMR chemical shifts

   Melittin in methanol is a small alpha -helical protein, and its chemical
   shifts change linearly and reversibly with pressure between 1 and 2000
   bar. An improved relationship between structure and HN shift has been
   calculated, and used to drive a molecular dynamics-based calculation of
   the change in structure. With pressure, the helix is compressed, with
   the H-O distance of the NH-O=C hydrogen bonds decreased by 0.021 +/-
   0.039 Angstrom, leading to an overall compression along the entire helix
   of about 0.4 Angstrom, corresponding to a static compressibility of 6
   x10(-)6 bar(-)1. The backbone dihedral angles phi and psi are altered by
   no more than +/- 3 degrees for most residues with a negative correlation
   coefficient of -0.85 between phi (i) and psi (i-1), indicating that the
   local conformation alters to maintain hydrogen bonds in good geometries.
   The method is shown to be capable of calculating structural change with

Abstract = {{The two conventional methods for wastewater chloramination control,

   Organochloramines, nitrite, manganese, and chromate positively interfere

   potential control may not be able to distinguish between monochloramine
   and weaker disinfecting organochloramines typically found in chlorinated
   domestic wastewaters. A new method of control is presented that is shown
   to be specific for the inorganic monochloramine species, The new method
   is based on a modification of the classical Berthelot analysis method
   for ammonia. Improvements to the method have greatly increased its
   selectivity toward monochloramine in chlorinated wastewater matrices.
   Break-point chlorination profiles of various chlorinated wastewaters
   demonstrate that the conventional control methods could potentially

Abstract = {{Fission yeast cells tolerate the total absence of the cdc25 mitotic

   this mutant operates in late G(2), which is different from wild-type
   (WT) cells. This fact suggests that in WT the rate-limiting molecular
   process during the G(2) timer is the Tyr15 dephosphorylation of cdc2,
   for which the cdc25 phosphatase (together with its back-up, pyp3) is
   dependent. In the wee1-50 cdc25 Delta mutant, the population splits into
   different clusters, all lacking mitotic size control. This strain
   maintains size homeostasis by a novel method, which is random movement
   of the cells from one cluster to another in the successive generations.
   These cells should normally have a `minimal cycle', a `timer' with short

   possibly at an early event and return back to early Gz, thus lengthening
   their cycles. The inability of these cells to start anaphase might be
   caused by the absence of the main mitotic regulators (wee1 and cdc25)

Abstract = {{The identification of Ca2+ as a cofactor in photosynthetic O-2 evolution
   has encouraged research into the role of Ca2+ in photosystem II (PSII).
   Previous methods used to identify the number of binding sites and their
   affinities were nor able to measure Ca2+ binding at thermodynamic
   equilibrium. We introduce the use of a Ca2+-selective electrode to study
   equilibrium binding of Ca2+ to PSII. The number and affinities of
   binding sites were determined via Scatchard analysis on a series of PSII
   membrane preparations progressively depleted of the extrinsic
   polypeptides and Mn. Untreated PSII membranes bound approximately 4 Ca2+
   per PSII with high affinity (K = 1.8 mu M) and a larger number of Ca2+
   with lower affinity, The high-affinity sites are assigned to divalent
   cation-binding sites on the light-harvesting complex II that are
   involved in membrane stacking, and the lower-affinity sites are
   attributed to nonspecific surface-binding sites. These sites were also
   observed in ail of the extrinsic polypeptide- and Mn-depleted
   preparations. Depletion of the extrinsic polypeptides and/or Mn exposed
   additional very high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites which were nor in
   equilibrium with free Ca2+ in untreated PSII, owing to the diffusion
   barrier created by the extrinsic polypeptides. Ca2+-depleted PSII
   membranes lacking the 23 and 17 kDa extrinsic proteins bound an
   additional 2.5 Ca2+ per PSII with K = 0.15 mu M. This number of very
   high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites agrees with the previous work of
   Cheniae and co-workers {[}Kalosaka, K., et al, (1990) in Current
   Research in Photosynthesis (Baltscheffsky, M., Ed.) pp 721-724, Kluwer,
   Dordrecht, The Netherlands] whose procedure for Ca2+ depletion was used.
   Further depletion of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein yielded a sample that
   bound only 0.7 very high-affinity Ca2+ per PSII with K = 0.19 mu M. The
   loss of 2 very high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites upon depletion of the 33
   kDa extrinsic protein could be due to a structural change of the
   O-2-evolving complex which lost 2-3 of the 4 Mn ions in this sample,
   Finally, PSII membranes depleted of Mn and the 33, 23, and 17 kDa
   extrinsic proteins bound approximately 4 very high-affinity Ca2+ per
   PSII with K = 0.08 mu M. These sites are assigned to Ca2+ binding to the
   vacant Mn sites.}},

Abstract = {{The excited-state dynamics of bacteriorhodopsin was studied by molecular
   dynamics simulation. For the purpose of suppressing large displacement
   of amino acid residues on the surface of bacteriorhodopsin, positional
   restraints were imposed on these residues. A new method was developed to
   investigate the movement of amino acid residues upon photoexcitation and
   their role on the ultrafast photoisomerization of the chromophore. The
   structural change of bacteriorhodopsin was then traced up to 200 fs,
   i.e. until the formation of the intermediate I. We found that when all
   the conjugated bonds of the chromophore were allowed to twist freely in
   the excited state, many bonds including the C13=C14 bond twist in large
   scale within 100 fs. When only the C13=C14 bond and the single bonds
   were allowed to twist freely, the twisting took place at most 20 degrees
   within 200 fs. From these results, it is claimed that a special
   potential surface is provided for the C13=C14 bond twisting by the
   protein environment in the course of the isomerization reaction, giving
   rise to the specific, ultrafast photoisomerization of bacteriorhodopsin.
   As a trace of such a mechanism, we observed that several functionally
   important residues incuding Asp85, Asp212 and Tyr185 responded quickly
   to the photoexcitation of the chromophore.}},

Abstract = {{We have characterized the guanidine-induced denaturation of hen egg
   white lysozyme within the 30-75 degrees C temperature range on the basis
   of equilibrium fluorescence measurements, unfolding assays, kinetic
   fluorescence measurements, and differential scanning calorimetry.
   Analysis of the guanidine denaturation profiles according to the linear
   extrapolation method yields values for the denaturation Gibbs energy
   which are about 15 kJ/mol lower than those derived from differential
   scanning calorimetry. Our results strongly suggest that this discrepancy
   is not due to deviations from the two-state denaturation mechanism. We
   propose a new method for the determination of denaturation Gibbs
   energies from solvent-denaturation data (the constant-Delta G
   extrapolation procedure). It employs several solvent-denaturation
   profiles (obtained at different temperatures) to generate the protein
   stability curve at zero denaturant concentration within the -8 to 8
   kJ/mol Delta G range. The method is model-independent and provides a
   practical, nonlinear alternative to the commonly employed linear
   extrapolation procedure. The application of the constant-Delta G method
   to our data suggests that the guanidine-concentration dependence of the
   denaturation Gibbs energy is approximately linear over an extended
   concentration range but, also, that strong deviations from linearity may
   occur at low guanidine concentrations. We tentatively attribute these
   deviations to the abrupt change of the contribution to protein stability
   that arises from pairwise charge-charge electrostatic interactions. This
   contribution may be positive, negative, or close to zero, depending on
   the pH value and the charge distribution on the native protein surface
   {[}Yang, A.-S., \& Honig, B. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 231, 459-474], which
   may help to explain why disparate effects have been found when studying
   protein denaturation at low guanidine concentrations. Kinetic nz values
   for lysozyme denaturation depend on temperature, in a manner which
   appears consistent with Hammond behavior.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a new method for the prediction of the lateral and the
   rotational positioning of transmembrane helices, based upon the present
   status of knowledge about the dominant interaction of the tertiary
   structure formation, The basic assumption about the interaction is that
   the interhelix binding is due to the polar interactions and that very
   short extramembrane loop segments restrict the relative position of the
   helices, Another assumption is made for the simplification of the
   prediction that a helix may be regarded as a continuum rod having polar
   interaction fields around it, The polar interaction field is calculated
   by a probe helix method, using a copolymer of serine and alanine as
   probe helices, The lateral position of helices is determined by the
   strength of the interhelix binding estimated from the polar interaction
   field together with the length of linking loop segments, The rotational
   positioning is determined by the polar interaction field, assuming the
   optimum lateral configuration. The structural change due to the binding
   of a prosthetic group is calculated, fixing the rotational freedom of a
   helix that is connected to the prosthetic group, Applying this method to
   bacteriorhodopsin, the optimum lateral and rotational positioning of
   transmembrane helices that are very similar to the experimental
   configuration was obtained, This method was implemented by a software
   system, which was developed for this work, and automatic calculation
   became possible for membrane proteins comprised of several transmembrane
