Title = {{Assessing integration of black cockatoos using behavioral change point

Abstract = {{Establishing integration of an individual bird into a wild flock is
   particularly important in species that are highly gregarious and are
   reliant on the flock to increase their likelihood of survivorship. When
   individuals, rehabilitated and reintroduced to wild flocks, are tracked
   through satellite or global positioning system (GPS) telemetry, it is of
   further significance to establish integration to assess rehabilitation
   success and whether the individual can serve as a marker of the flock.
   To date, for black cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus spp.) this has been
   achieved through visual observations, which requires field-based
   observations that may not be possible because of inaccessible terrain,
   or may be untenable because the tagged individual can move quickly or is
   cryptic within a given land cover type. To establish whether an
   individual had joined a flock, we proposed the use of behavioral change
   point analysis. Our analyses showed that for GPS data of 6 individuals
   of the 3 black cockatoo species endemic to Western Australia we could
   demonstrate behavioral differences in their movement paths that were
   either individual or flocked (integrated) behavior. We undertook field
   observations to validate integration into wild flocks. We characterized
   flocked behavior as a constant, repeated pattern at variable levels of
   velocity. Individual behavior manifested in 2 different forms: resident
   and exploratory behavior. The analysis showed that all birds had
   integrated into a wild flock within a month of release. Behavioral
   change point analysis is a useful method to characterize movement
   behavior in black cockatoos and to confirm their membership within a
   flock. Furthermore, confirmation of flock membership makes it possible
   to use the data from 1 tagged bird to indicate movement behavior at the
   flock level. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements Commentary 27
   examines recent epidemiologic data primarily from low-dose or low
   dose-rate studies of low linear-energy-transfer radiation and cancer to
   assess whether they support the linear no-threshold model as used in
   radiation protection. The commentary provides a critical review of
   low-dose or low dose-rate studies, most published within the last 10 y,
   that are applicable to current occupational, environmental, and medical
   radiation exposures. The strengths and weaknesses of the epidemiologic
   methods, dosimetry assessments, and statistical modeling of 29
   epidemiologic studies of total solid cancer, leukemia, breast cancer,
   and thyroid cancer, as well as heritable effects and a few nonmalignant
   conditions, were evaluated. An appraisal of the degree to which the
   low-dose or low dose-rate studies supported a linear no-threshold model
   for radiation protection or on the contrary, demonstrated sufficient
   evidence that the linear no-threshold model is inappropriate for the
   purposes of radiation protection was also included. The review found
   that many, though not all, studies of solid cancer supported the
   continued use of the linear no-threshold model in radiation protection.
   Evaluations of the principal studies of leukemia and low-dose or low
   dose-rate radiation exposure also lent support for the linear
   no-threshold model as used in protection. Ischemic heart disease, a
   major type of cardiovascular disease, was examined briefly, but the
   results of recent studies were considered too weak or inconsistent to
   allow firm conclusions regarding support of the linear no-threshold
   model. It is acknowledged that the possible risks from very low doses of
   low linear-energy-transfer radiation are small and uncertain and that it
   may never be possible to prove or disprove the validity of the linear
   no-threshold assumption by epidemiologic means. Nonetheless, the
   preponderance of recent epidemiologic data on solid cancer is supportive
   of the continued use of the linear no-threshold model for the purposes
   of radiation protection. This conclusion is in accord with judgments by
   other national and international scientific committees, based on
   somewhat older data. Currently, no alternative dose-response
   relationship appears more pragmatic or prudent for radiation protection
   purposes than the linear no-threshold model.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing penetration of nano-products to the market is raising big
   concerns about the potential toxic and environmental effects of their
   constituent engineered nanoparticles (ENPs). Contradictory toxicity test
   results reported in the literature thus far can be explained by
   differences in the ENP production methods, which can strongly affect
   nanoparticle purity and therefore the outcome of the tests. In this
   paper we investigate the toxicity of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) produced
   by spark ablation - a gas-phase technique that can deliver well-defined
   nanoparticles of high purity on Lemna minor. Our results show that AgNPs
   exhibit a toxic behavior at concentrations as low as 5 mu g L-1, which
   is considerably lower compared to the threshold concentrations reported
   in other studies. This difference can be attributed to the purity of the
   ENPs used in our measurements, which can release higher concentrations
   of toxic Ag+ ions upon dilution in the test solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The most effective biocide used historically in antifouling paints is
   tributyltin (TBT). However, due to its extreme toxicity to non-target
   organisms and its persistence in the environment, the use of TBT and
   other organotin compounds (OTCs) was restricted in EU on leisure boats
   and ships in 1989 and 2003, respectively. Nevertheless, studies
   worldwide still report TBT to be released from both ships and leisure
   boats. Here, we present a new application for a field portable X-ray
   fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) used for screening for organotin paint
   through measurements of tin (Sn) on leisure boats and ships.
   Measurements on ships built after the restrictions showed concentrations
   of up to 68 mu g Sn/cm(2), likely due to impurities of inorganic Sn, as
   shown through chemical analysis of 21 organotin-free paints. A threshold
   value of 100 mu g Sn/cm(2) is suggested, where exceedance indicates
   presence of OTCs. Screening with the XRF method showed 10\% of the
   commercial vessels (n = 30) and 23-29\% of leisure boats (n = 693,
   investigated in this and in a previous study) to hold concentrations

Abstract = {{Impervious surface (IS) area is an important indicator of ecological

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{While quality of life (QOL) is the result of satisfying human needs, our
   current provision strategies result in global environmental degradation.
   To ensure sustainable QOL, we need to understand the environmental
   impact of human needs satisfaction. In this paper we deconstruct QOL,
   and apply the fundamental human needs framework developed by Max-Neef et
   al to calculate the carbon and energy footprints of subsistence,
   protection, creation, freedom, leisure, identity, understanding and
   participation. We find that half of global carbon emissions are driven
   by subsistence and protection. A similar amount are due to freedom,
   identity, creation and leisure together, whereas understanding and
   participation jointly account for less than 4\% of global emissions. We
   use 35 objective and subjective indicators to evaluate human needs
   satisfaction and their associated carbon footprints across nations. We
   find that the relationship between QOL and environmental impact is more
   complex than previously identified through aggregated or single
   indicators. Satisfying needs such as protection, identity and leisure is
   generally not correlated with their corresponding footprints. In
   contrast, the likelihood of satisfying needs for understanding,
   creation, participation and freedom, increases steeply when moving from
   low to moderate emissions, and then stagnates. Most objective indicators
   show a threshold trend with respect to footprints, but most subjective
   indicators show no relationship, except for freedom and creation. Our
   study signals the importance of considering both subjective and
   objective satisfaction to assess QOL-impact relationships at the needs
   level. In this way, resources could be strategically invested where they
   strongly relate to social outcomes, and spared where non-consumption
   satisfiers could be more effective. Through this approach, decoupling
   human needs satisfaction from environmental damage becomes more
   attainable.}},

Abstract = {{This main objective of this study is flash flood susceptibility modeling
   using geo-morphometric and hydrological approaches in Panjkora Basin,
   Eastern Hindu Kush, Pakistan. In the study region, flash flood is one of
   the horrific and recurrent hydro-meteorological disasters causing
   damages to human life, their properties, and infrastructure. Watershed
   modeling approach is implemented to delineate Panjkora Basin, its
   sub-basins, and extract drainage network by utilizing Advance Space
   borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital
   Elevation Model as an input data in geographic information system
   environment. A total of 30 sub-basins were delineated using threshold of
   25km(2). The geo-morphometric parameters of each sub-basin were computed
   by applying Hortonian, Schumm, and Strahler Geo-morphological laws. The
   value of each parameter was normalized and aggregated into
   geo-morphometric ranking number depicting the degree of flash flood
   susceptibility. Surface run-off depth of each sub-basin is estimated by
   applying Natural Resource Conservation Service Curve Number hydrological
   model. Both models outputs were integrated by implementing weighted
   overlay analysis technique and susceptibility map is obtained. The
   resultant map was analyzed and zonated into very high, high, moderate,
   low, and very low flash flood susceptibility zones. These zones were
   spread over an area of 1441km(2) (27\%), 1950km(2) (36.5\%), 1252km(2)
   (23.4\%), 604km(2) (11.3\%), and 98km(2) (1.8\%), respectively.
   Spatially, the very high susceptible zone is located in the upstream
   areas, characterized by snow covered peaks, steep gradient (>30
   degrees), and high drainage density (>1.7km/km(2)), and geologically
   dominated by igneous and metamorphic lithological units. Analysis
   indicated that flash flood susceptibility is directly increases with
   increasing surface run-off and geo-morphometric ranking number. A new
   model is developed to geo-visualize the spatial pattern of flash flood
   susceptibility. Accuracy of the model is assessed using global
   positioning system-based primary data regarding past-flood damages and
   flood marks. The study results can facilitate Disaster Management
   Authorities and flood dealing line agencies to initiate
   location-specific flood-risk reduction strategies in highly susceptible
   areas of Panjkora Basin. Similarly, this methodological approach can be
   adapted for any highland river system.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{54-60}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Issue Owing to their large-scale scope and emphasis on prediction,
   macroecological models have the potential to provide key contributions
   to evidence-based conservation practice. However, examples of
   macroecological modelling outputs directly influencing conservation
   practice and decision-making remain rare. The general barriers to
   implementation of ecological research into conservation practice have
   been discussed at length, whereas much less attention has been given to
   the specific barriers faced by macroecological modelling research.
   Evidence Here, I start to address this gap by discussing how two
   important barriers could be overcome in a practical manner, because
   their burden falls primarily on the researcher. The first barrier is the
   potential perception of macroecological models as ``black boxes{''} by
   potential end-users, who may have little time and/or quantitative
   training to inspect the underlying methods fully. The second barrier is
   the difficulty in effective translation of the uncertainty inherent to
   most macroecological models, given the high threshold for weight of
   evidence required to support most decisions. To overcome these barriers,
   I put forward a number of solutions, most of which rely on researchers
   agreeing to and adopting model documentation and communication standards
   already in existence. Conclusion I conclude by introducing the bigger
   challenges ahead for the macroecology-conservation practice interface:
   transformation of publication incentives and establishment of a two-way
   flow of knowledge between macroecologists and conservation
   practitioners. Macroecologists can contribute much-needed evidence to
   support conservation decisions. However, fundamental changes to their
   research communication standards, their publication incentives and their
   understanding of regulatory settings will be needed to ensure that
   macroecological contributions are considered in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Farmland soil heavy metal contamination could pose potential risks to
   ecosystems, food safety and human health ultimately. Regional researches
   on the long-term monitoring of heavy metals in a soil-rice grain system,
   changed with environmental policy adjustment, have been hindered by
   limited detailed data. In this study, we collected 169 paired paddy rice
   grain and corresponding soil samples from a former intensive
   electronic-waste dismantling region to survey the current status of
   heavy metal contamination, and to reveal the temporal trends over the
   past decade based on the previous data obtained in 2006 and 2011.
   Moderate contaminations of Cd, Cu, Zn and Ni were observed in soil
   currently. Furthermore, 20.7\% of rice grain samples exceeded the Cd
   threshold value. Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb shared the similar spatial
   distribution pattern with higher concentrations in northwest, which were
   contrary to Cr, Ni and As. Risk assessment indicated that much attention
   is required for the carcinogenic risk of Cr, Cd and As and
   non-carcinogen risk of Cr. Combining the spatial distribution of heavy
   metals in soil and rice grains, and the potential ecological risks, with
   the human health risks, the middle-west rice paddies were identified and
   proposed as priority areas. Percentage of soil Pb, Cd and Zn decreased
   in most area and slightly increased in northwest and east. Cu decreased
   in southwest and increased in central part, while Ni slightly increased
   in the whole region between 2006 and 2016. With the scrutiny of strict
   environmental policy, Cd still remained relatively constant levels in
   soil and rice grains during the last decade, which confirmed that the
   heavy metals were persisted over the long duration. Target sustainable
   and ongoing green remediation methods should be adopted urgently in
   specific area to guarantee food safety and human health for local

Abstract = {{Integrated models addressing microplastic (MP) generation, terrestrial
   distribution, and freshwater transport are useful tools characterizing
   the export of MP to marine waters. In Part I of this study, a baseline
   watershed-scale MP mass balance model was developed for tire and road

   and sensitivity analysis (SA) methods were used to identify the
   parameters that determine the transport of these particles to the
   estuary. Local differential, local range and global first-order
   variance-based SA identified similar key parameters. The global SA (1000
   Monte Carlo simulations) indicated that most of the variance in TRWP
   exported to the estuary can be apportioned to TRWP diameter (76\%), TRWP
   density (5.6\%), the fraction of TRWP directed to combined sewers with
   treatment (3.9\%), and the fraction of TRWP distributed to runoff
   (versus roadside soil; 2.2\%). The export fraction was relatively
   insensitive to heteroaggregation processes and the rainfall intensity
   threshold for road surface washoff. The fraction of TRWP exported to
   estuary in the probabilistic assessment was centered on the baseline
   estimate of 2\%. This fraction ranged from 1.4 to 4.9\% (central
   tendency defined as 25th to 75th percentile) and 0.97\% to 13\%
   (plausible upper bound defined as 10th to 90th percentiles). This study
   emphasizes the importance of in situ characterization of TRWP diameter
   and density, and confirms the baseline mass balance presented in Part I,
   which indicated an appreciable potential for capture of TRWP in

   flexibility to be configured for different sensors. Compared to

Abstract = {{Background: A high number of women report experiencing intimate partner
   violence (IPV). It is of utmost importance to identify possible factors
   that precipitate IPV and incorporate them into police protocols for
   evaluating IPV risk. Scientific evidence shows that environmental
   temperature is associated with a risk of violent behavior.
   Objectives: To analyze the effect and impact of heat waves on the risk
   of IPV.
   Methods: Ecological, longitudinal time series study. The dependent
   variables are: intimate partner femicides (IPF), reports of IPV and 016
   IPV telephone help line calls in the Community of Madrid from 05/01 to
   09/30 in the years 2008-2016. The principal independent variable is the
   daily maximum temperature in Celsius (Tmax) above the heat wave
   threshold of 34 degrees C. A binomial negative regression was used for
   calls and reports and a Poisson regression was used for IPF. The
   attributable risk among those exposed (AR\%) and the number of
   attributable cases was calculated for each variable.
   Results: The risk of IPF increased three days after the heat wave,
   {[}RR(IC95\%): 1.40(1.00-1.97)], police reports of IPV increased one day
   after {[}RR (IC95\%): 1.02(1.00-1.03) and help line calls increased five
   days after {[}RR(IC95\%): 1.01(1.00-1.03)]. The AR\% was 28.8\% (IC95\%:
   0.3\%-49.2\%) for IPF, 1.7\% (IC95\%: 0.3\%-3.1\%) for police reports
   and 1.43\% (IC95: 0.1\%; 2.8\%) for help line calls.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that heat waves are associated with an
   increase in IPV. The effect of an increase in IPV is delayed in time,

Abstract = {{Rapid urbanization and economic development have led to the development
   of heavy industry and structural re-equalization in mainland China. This
   has resulted in scattered and disorderly layouts becoming prominent in
   the region. Furthermore, economic development has exacerbated pressures
   on regional resources and the environment and has threatened sustainable
   and coordinated development in the region. The NASA Land Science
   Investigator Processing System (Land-SIPS) Visible Infrared Imaging
   Radiometer (VIIRS) 375-m active fire product (VNP14IMG) was selected
   from the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) to
   study the spatiotemporal patterns of heavy industry development.
   Furthermore, we employed an improved adaptive K-means algorithm to
   realize the spatial segmentation of long-order VNP14IMG and constructed
   heat source objects. Lastly, we used a threshold recognition model to
   identify heavy industry objects from normal heat source objects. Results
   suggest that the method is an accurate and effective way to monitor heat
   sources generated from heavy industry. Moreover, some conclusions about
   heavy industrial heat source distribution in mainland China at different
   scales were obtained. Those can be beneficial for policy-makers and
   heavy industry regulation.}},

Abstract = {{The improvement of pedestrian safety plays a crucial role in developing
   a safe and friendly walking environments, which can contribute to urban
   sustainability. A preliminary step in improving pedestrian safety is to
   identify hazardous road locations for pedestrians. This study proposes a
   framework for the identification of vehicle-pedestrian collision hot
   spots by integrating the information about both the likelihood of the
   occurrence of vehicle-pedestrian collisions and the potential for the
   reduction in vehicle-pedestrian crashes. First, a vehicle-pedestrian
   collision density surface was produced via network kernel density
   estimation. By assigning a threshold value, possible vehicle-pedestrian
   hot spots were identified. To obtain the potential for
   vehicle-pedestrian collision reduction, random forests was employed to
   model the density with a set of variables describing vehicle and
   pedestrian flows. The potential for crash reduction was then measured as
   the difference between the observed vehicle-pedestrian crash density and
   the prediction produced by the random forests models. The final hotspots
   were determined by excluding those with a crash reduction value of no
   more than zero. The method was applied to the identification of
   hazardous road locations for pedestrians in a district in Shanghai,
   China. The result indicates that the method is useful for

Abstract = {{Underground coal fires are one of the most common and serious geohazards
   in most coal producing countries in the world. Monitoring their
   spatio-temporal changes plays an important role in controlling and
   preventing the effects of coal fires, and their environmental impact. In
   this study, the spatio-temporal changes of underground coal fires in
   Khanh Hoa coal field (North-East of Viet Nam) were analyzed using
   Landsat time-series data during the 2008-2016 period. Based on land
   surface temperatures retrieved from Landsat thermal data, underground
   coal fires related to thermal anomalies were identified using the
   MEDIAN+1.5xIQR (IQR: Interquartile range) threshold technique. The
   locations of underground coal fires were validated using a coal fire map
   produced by the field survey data and cross-validated using the daytime
   ASTER thermal infrared imagery. Based on the fires extracted from seven
   Landsat thermal imageries, the spatiotemporal changes of underground
   coal fire areas were analyzed. The results showed that the
   thermalanomalous zones have been correlated with known coal fires.
   Cross-validation of coal fires using ASTER TIR data showed a high
   consistency of 79.3\%. The largest coal fire area of 184.6 hectares was
   detected in 2010, followed by 2014 (181.1 hectares) and 2016 (178.5
   hectares). The smaller coal fire areas were extracted with areas of
   133.6 and 152.5 hectares in 2011 and 2009 respectively. Underground coal
   fires were mainly detected in the northern and southern part, and tend
   to spread to north-west of the coal field.}},

Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ozone concentrations are expected to rise in developing countries,
   potentially reducing crop yield and causing great economic losses.
   Therefore, an ozone biomonitoring system based on the ratio of the
   biomass of ozone-resistant (NC-R) and ozone-sensitive (NC-S) biotypes of
   white clover (Trifolium repens cv. Regal) is tested over 2 years (2012
   and 2013) at four sites with neighboring crop production in the
   Metropolitan Region of Campinas (MRC), Brazil. The biomass production of
   both clones is similar at the four sites studied in the MRC, but
   significant differences are observed between the monthly harvests during
   the experimental period. Linear regression analyses show contrasting
   results from the experimental years. During 2012, the biomass of both
   clones correlated positively with precipitation and relative humidity,
   and negatively with vapor pressure deficit, particulate matter, nitrogen
   dioxide, and ozone. During 2013, the biomass production of both clones
   did not significantly correlate with oscillating environmental
   conditions. No significant linear regression between the NC-S/NC-R
   biomass ratio and ozone is found in either year. A stepwise backward
   multilinear method identified nitrogen dioxide and accumulated dose over
   a threshold of 40 ppb (AOT40) as the main parameters negatively
   affecting the biomasses of both clones; particulate matter affected only
   the sensitive clone. This field experiment shows that the current
   concentrations of ozone may affect sensitive Brazilian crops.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The ability of tree species to track their climatic niche at rates
   comparable to global warming is of concern, particularly if they are
   constrained by local adaptation. If a species is locally adapted at its
   range margin, it could be beneficial for range expansion because it
   ensures that the genotypes colonizing new areas are the fittest, given
   that environmental conditions are more similar to the current ones. In
   trees, local adaptation can slow range expansion when climate change
   happens much faster than their ability to migrate. Location Time period
   Quebec, Canada. 2013-2015. Major taxa studied Methods Trees. We
   investigate experimentally a series of factors thought to constrain the
   seedling phase at the leading edge of the distribution of a dominant
   tree species, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall.). We established a
   seed transplant experiment using six provenances, representing the
   latitudinal species range, and transplanted them to 12 sites within, at
   and beyond the current northern species range margin. Results Main
   conclusions At present, northern provenances provide the best
   opportunity for establishment beyond the current range, where climatic
   conditions are more similar than those of the warmer central or southern
   portions of the species range. Establishment was highest within the
   species range, but survival rates were comparable to those at the range
   margin and beyond, regardless of provenance. We also found that the
   local climate was the most influential factor for early seedling
   establishment and survival; however, a lack of suitable microsites also
   significantly constrained recruitment. Our study highlights the complex
   interaction between provenance, climate and microsite conditions that is
   required to ensure successful seedling recruitment. Although sugar maple
   is currently displaying evidence for local adaptation to facilitate
   range shifts, it could risk maladaptation in the future if the local
   climate warms beyond a threshold required to ensure seed germination and
   a lack of favourable microsite conditions beyond the range.}},

Abstract = {{Eucalyptus spp. and Acacia mearnsii are common exotic tree species in
   eastern Africa that have shown (strong) invasive behavior in some
   regions. Acacia mearnsii is considered a highly invasive species that is
   replacing native species and Eucalyptus spp. are known to consume high
   amounts of groundwater with suspected effects on native flora. Mapping
   the occurrence of these species in the Taita Hills, Kenya (part of the
   Eastern Arc Mountains Biodiversity Hotspot) is important as there is
   lack of knowledge on their occurrence and ecological impact in the area.
   Mapping methods that require a lot of fieldwork are impractical in areas
   like the Taita Hills, where the terrain is rugged and the infrastructure
   is poor. Our aim was hence to map the occurrence of these tree species
   in a 100 km(2) area using airborne imaging spectroscopy and laser
   scanning. We used a one class biased support vector machine (BSVM)
   classifier as it needs labeled training data only for the positive
   classes (A. mearnsii and Eucalyptus spp.), which potentially reduces the
   amount of required fieldwork. We also introduce a new approach for
   parameterizing and setting the threshold level simultaneously for the
   BSVM classifier. The second aim was to link the occurrence of these
   species to selected environmental variables. The results showed that the
   BSVM classifier is suitable for mapping Acacia mearnsii and Eucalyptus
   spp., holding the potential to improve the efficiency of field data
   collection. The introduced parametrization/threshold selection method
   performed better than other commonly used approaches. The crown level
   Fl-score was 0.76 for Eucalyptus spp. and 0.78 for A. mearnsii. We show
   that Eucalyptus spp. and A. mearnsii trees cover 0.8\% and 1.6\% of the
   study area, respectively. Both species are particularly located on
   steeper slopes and higher altitudes. Both species have significant
   occurrences in areas close to the biggest remaining native forest patch
   (Ngangao) in the study area. Nonetheless, follow-up studies are needed
   to evaluate their impact on the native flora and fauna, as well as their
   impact on the water resources. The maps created in this study in
   combination with such follow-up studies could serve as base data to
   generate guidelines that authorities can use to take action in handling
   the problems these species are causing.}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput transcriptomic technologies are increasingly being used
   to screen environmental chemicals in vitro to provide mechanistic
   context for regulatory testing. The TGx-DDI biomarker is a 64-gene
   expression profile generated from testing 28 model chemicals or
   treatments (13 that cause DNA damage and 15 that do not) in human TK6
   cells. While the biomarker is very accurate at predicting DNA damage
   inducing (DDI) potential using the nearest shrunken centroid method, the
   broad utility of the biomarker using other computational methods is not
   fully known. Here, we determined the accuracy of the biomarker used with
   the Running Fisher test, a nonparametric correlation test. In TK6 cells,
   the methods could readily differentiate DDI and non-DDI compounds with
   balanced accuracies of 87-97\%, depending on the threshold for
   determining DDI positives. The methods identified DDI agents in the
   metabolically competent hepatocyte cell line HepaRG (accuracy = 90\%)
   but not in HepG2 cells or hepatocytes derived from embryonic stem cells
   (60 and 80\%, respectively). DDI was also accurately classified when the
   gene expression changes were derived using the nCounter technology
   (accuracy = 89\%). In addition, we found: (1) not all genes contributed
   equally to the correlations; (2) the minimal overlap in genes between
   the biomarker and the individual comparisons required for significant
   positive correlation was 10 genes, but usually was much higher; and (3)
   different sets of genes in the biomarker can by themselves contribute to
   the significant correlations. Overall, these results demonstrate the
   utility of the biomarker to accurately classify DDI agents. Environ.

Abstract = {{PurposeRiparian zone contamination is a growing problem for several
   European catchments due to high anthropogenic pressures. This study
   investigates As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations in the Sava
   River riparian zone, characterized by wide agricultural areas, various
   geological substrates, and different types of industrial pollution. The
   accumulation and mobility of these elements were studied because they
   are listed as priority substances in the Water Framework Directive and
   environmental objectives for surface waters.Materials and
   methodsSampling was performed during the sampling campaign of the EU 7th
   FW-funded GLOBAQUA project in September 2015 during a low-water event.
   Soil samples were collected along the Sava River at 12 selected sampling
   sites, from a depth of 0-30cm, at a distance of 10-15m from the river
   bank. The extent of pollution was estimated by determining total and
   readily soluble element concentrations in the soils. Potential
   ecological risk and the source of the selected elements in the soils was
   determined using the enrichment factor (EF), potential ecological risk
   index (RI), and statistical methods such as the principal component
   analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA).Results
   and discussionThis study showed that concentrations of the selected
   elements increase along the Sava. In terms of origin, PCA and MLRA
   indicated that Cr and Ni in soils are predominantly lithogenic, while
   As, Cd, Pb, and Zn are both lithogenic and anthropogenic (ore deposits,
   industry, and agriculture). PCA singled out Cu since its origin in soil
   is most probably from specific point-source pollution. EF was generally
   minor to moderate for most of the examined elements, apart from Cu, for
   which the EF was significant at one sampling site. Overall ecological
   risk (RI) fell within the low-risk category for most sites, apart from
   Belgrade sampling site (BEO), where high total Cd content affected
   individual and overall ecological risk indicators, indicating Cd could
   represent a considerable ecological risk for the downstream riparian
   zone.ConclusionsAt downstream sites, there was a noticeable increase in
   PTE content, with Cd, Cr, Ni, and Zn exceeding the proposed threshold
   values for European soils, indicating rising contamination in riparian
   soils. In terms of the ecological risk, only Cd could pose a potential
   ecological threat for the downstream riparian zone.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Identifying priority areas for biodiversity conservation is particularly
   challenging in the marine environment due to the open and dynamic nature
   of the ocean, the paucity of information on species distribution, and
   the necessary balance between marine biodiversity conservation and
   essential supporting services such as seafood provision. We used the
   Patagonian seabird breeding community as a case study to propose an
   integrated and adaptive method for delimiting key marine areas for
   conservation. Priority areas were defined through a free
   decision-support tool (Marxan) that included projected at-sea
   distributions of seabirds (approximately 2,225,000 individuals of 14
   species); BirdLife Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) for
   pelagic bird species; and the economic costs of potential regulations in
   fishing practices. The proposed reserve network encompassed
   approximately 300,000 km(2) that was largely concentrated in northern
   and southern inshore and northern and central offshore regions. This
   reserve network exceeded the minimum threshold of 20\% conservation of
   the abundance of each species proposed by the World Parks Congress.
   Based on marine currents in the study area, we further identified the 3
   primary water masses that may influence areas of conservation priority
   through water inflow. Our reserve network may benefit from enhanced
   marine productivity in these highly connected areas, but they may be
   threatened by human impacts such as marine pollution. Our method of
   reserve network design is an important advance with respect to the more
   classical approaches based on criteria defined for one or a few species
   and may be particularly useful when information on spatial patterns is
   data deficient. Our approach also accommodates addition of new
   information on seabird distribution and population dynamics, human
   activities, and alterations in the marine environment.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Everyday exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields
   (RF-EMF) emitted from wireless devices such as mobile phones and base
   stations, radio and television transmitters is ubiquitous. Some people
   attribute non-specific physical symptoms (NSPS) such as headache and
   fatigue to exposure to RF-EMF. Most previous laboratory studies or
   studies that analyzed populations at a group level did not find evidence
   of an association between RF-EMF exposure and NSPS.
   Objectives: We explored the association between exposure to RF-EMF in
   daily life and the occurrence of NSPS in individual self-declared
   electrohypersensitive persons using body worn exposimeters and
   electronic diaries.
   Methods: We selected seven individuals who attributed their NSPS to
   RF-EMF exposure. The level of and variability in personal RF-EMF
   exposure and NSPS were determined during a three-week period. Data were
   analyzed using time series analysis in which exposure as measured and
   recorded in the diary was correlated with NSPS.
   Results: We found statistically significant correlations between
   perceived and actual exposure to wireless internet (WiFi - rate of
   change and number of peaks above threshold) and base stations for mobile
   telecommunications (GSM + UMTS downlink, rate of change) and NSPS scores
   in four of the seven participants. In two persons a higher EMF exposure
   was associated with higher symptom scores, and in two other persons it
   was associated with lower scores. Remarkably, we found no significant
   correlations between NSPS and time weighted average power density, the
   most commonly used exposure metric.
   Conclusions: RF-EMF exposure was associated either positively or
   negatively with NSPS in some but not all of the selected self-declared
   electrohypersensitive persons.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microorganisms are crucial to indicate ecosystem functions of
   terrestrial ecosystems. However, the responses of microbial communities
   to soil nutrient limitation in desert-grassland are still poorly
   understood. Hence, we investigated soil microbial community structures
   and metabolic characteristics in a desert-grassland ecological
   transition zone from the northern Loess Plateau, China, and explored the
   association of microbial communities with nutrient limitation via
   high-throughput sequencing.Threshold elemental ratios (TER) indicated
   that the microbial communities were strongly limited by nitrogen (N)
   under A. ordosica and P. tabuliformis communities. The phosphorus (P)
   limitation of microbial communities was observed in the aeolian sandy
   soil. The results imply that soil microbial communities had strong
   nutrient competition for N and P with aboveground vegetation in arid and
   oligotrophic ecosystems. The LEfSe and linear regression analysis
   revealed that the microbial taxa of Micrococcales, Micrococcaceae and
   Herpotrichiellaceae were significantly correlated with microbial N
   limitation. The Thermoleophilia taxa were significantly correlated with
   microbial P limitation. These biomarkers related to microbial nutrient
   limitation could be considered as the key microbial taxa to shape
   microbial communities and functions. Furthermore. N form had different
   effects on microbial communities, which NH4+-N strongly affected
   bacterial communities, whereas NO3--N had a significant influence on
   fungal communities. The different responses indicate that soil
   microorganisms had corresponding nutrient preferences for bacterial and
   fungal communities, which might alleviate the nutrient limitations and
   environmental stress. This study provided important insights on
   microbial community structures linking to community functions and on the
   mechanisms governing microbial N and P limitation in arid land

   interactions that sustain ecological integrity in Mexico}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundThis paper presents several spatial indicators developed to
   evaluate anthropogenic impacts on predator-prey interactions and their
   relationship with ecological integrity loss in Mexico. Ecological
   integrity loss is defined as the inability to sustain viable
   populations, habitat functions, and species interactions of Nearctic and
   Neotropical apex predators as a result of anthropogenic effects. As
   direct impacts, the indicators evaluate habitat loss and the number of
   inhospitable habitats. As indirect impacts, the indicators evaluate the
   avoidance of human features such as highways, roads, and human
   locations. The total impact level is described at 1km(2) resolution, and
   registered within the domain defined by the spatial habitat requirements
   of apex predators. The impact level is associated with ecological
   integrity loss, or the ecosystem capacity to reorganize habitat
   functions and sustain predator-prey interactions as the most visible
   elements of ecological integrity. Ecological integrity loss is evaluated
   for different groups of apex predators that are classified with
   different levels of anthropogenic threat.ResultsThe framework presented
   here identifies the spatial information needed for the assessment of
   cumulative anthropogenic impacts. By characterizing their distribution
   range, Nearctic predators have significantly larger intact habitats than
   neotropical predators but with higher ecological degradation, less
   landscape transformation, and overall less ecological integrity. As
   observed within their distribution areas, indirect impacts have a
   generalized effect in the broad range of landscapes in Mexico.
   Ecological integrity loss is the result of road, highway, and human
   settlement avoidance; but landscape transformation and human activity
   control the threshold for which ecological integrity loss becomes
   critical. On the other hand, there are no significant differences in
   impact levels among threat conservation categories for apex predators,
   which indicate that all predator species have the same threat level and
   should be all included in protection efforts.ConclusionsWith the
   application of this spatial framework, the significance, scale, and
   baseline conditions can be established for evaluating anthropogenic
   impacts on ecological integrity. The analysis of the current condition
   shows the status for apex predator in the country, and identifies the
   ecological integrity threshold when human activities have severe to
   highly severe impacts in the landscape, threatening the viability of
   populations and their habitat.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new approach of change detection that reduces
   seasonality in time series by using Photosynthetic Vegetation Time
   Series (PVTS) from satellite images. With this approach, each pixel
   value represents at the subpixel level a fraction of the photosynthetic
   forest's activity. Our hypothesis is based on an assumption that
   photosynthetic vegetation fractions will remain constant until a
   disturbing agent (natural or anthropic) occurs. Using Landsat data, we
   compared our approach with the Carnegie Landsat Systems Analysis-Lite
   (CLASlite) approach and with the national reports of the Ministry of the
   Environment of Peru (MINAM). After reducing seasonal variations in
   Landsat data, we detected deforestation events with a new detection
   method. Our approach (which was called PVts-beta) of detection is a
   simple method that does not model the seasonality and it only requires
   as inputs: i) the average and standard deviation of the time series of a
   pixel and ii) a threshold magnitude (beta) that was calibrated to detect
   deforestation events in tropical forests. For the PVts-beta approach,
   the results of calibration show that deforestation was optimally
   detected for beta = (5,6), higher or lower than this range, the biases
   favor to false detections and favor the omission of deforestation too.
   On the other hand, the overall accuracy for the PVts-beta approach was
   91.1\%, with an omission and commission of 8.3\% and 0.5\% respectively,
   while for CLASlite the overall accuracy was 79.2\%, with an omission and
   commission of 20.8\% and 0.0\% respectively. The differences in the
   overall accuracy between the PVts-beta and CLASlite approach were
   significant, being atmospheric noise a main problem which CLASlite
   usually does not work optimally. The strength of our PVts-beta approach
   is the early detection at the subpixel level of deforestation events
   that, added to our new method of change detection explain the little
   omission obtained in the results. Therefore, the PVts-beta approach-that
   we propose here- provides the opportunity to monitoring deforestation
   events in tropical forests at sub-annual scales using Landsat data, and
   it can be used for near-real-time change detection monitoring without a
   doubt.}},

Title = {{Implications of being discrete and spatial for detecting early warning
   signals of regime shifts}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Theory suggests that ecological systems exhibit a pronounced slow down
   in their dynamics, known as `critical slowing down' (CSD), before they
   undergo regime shifts or critical transitions. As a result of CSD,
   ecosystems exhibit characteristic temporal and spatial changes which can
   be used as early warning signals of imminent regime shifts. For temporal
   data, statistical methods to detect these generic indicators of
   ecosystem resilience are well developed. However, for spatial data,
   despite a well developed theoretical framework, statistical methods such
   as data pre-processing and null models to detect EWS are relatively
   poorly developed. In this manuscript, we investigate the case of a
   common type of ecological spatial dataset which consists of binary
   values at each location (e.g. occupied/unoccupied, tree/grass or
   coralline/bleached). We employ a cellular-automaton based
   spatially-explicit model which generates data that mimics remotely
   sensed or field collected high-resolution spatial data with a binary
   classification of the state variables at each location. We demonstrate
   that trends in two spatial metrics, spatial variance and spatial
   skewness, of such binary spatial data lead to false, failed or
   misleading signals of transitions. We find that, two other indicators,
   spatial autocorrelation at lag-1 and spectral density ratio, accurately
   reflect CSD even with binary spatial data. To overcome the problems
   associated with detection of EWS using spatial variance and skewness, we
   investigate a data pre-processing method called `coarse-graining' which
   is inspired from the physics literature on phase transitions.
   Coarse-graining reduces the spatial resolution of data by averaging
   state variables over small scales. Yet, it enables detection of
   CSD-based spatial indicators of impending critical transitions. In
   summary, our study provides a theoretical basis, and rigorous
   evaluation, of coarse-graining as a pre-processing step to analyse
   spatial datasets with discrete state classifications.}},

Title = {{Regime shifts by front dynamics}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{544-552}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystems are highly nonlinear dissipative systems that often admit
   multiple alternative stable states, but seldom have the time span to
   converge to these states as they are repeatedly interfered by
   environmental changes and disturbances. Multiplicity of stable states in
   variable and disturbed environments is of high concern because of the
   possible occurrence of regime shifts, i.e. state transitions that
   involve large, abrupt decline in ecosystem function. State transitions
   induced by disturbances, however, need not be abrupt as the disturbances
   are often limited in their spatial extent. In that case they induce
   local state transitions that result in spatially confined
   alternative-state domains. The subsequent dynamics crucially depend on
   the dynamics of the transition zones or fronts that bound these domains.
   In this paper we study three aspects of front dynamics that affect the
   nature of regime shifts and their outcomes: single-front motion, front
   interactions and front instabilities. Using models of dryland vegetation
   as a case study we show that fronts can change their speed and invert
   their direction of motion as parameters change across a threshold value
   the Maxwell point, that fronts may slow down or stop entirely when
   interacting with other fronts, and that disturbances may change one
   front type to another, each with its distinct speed. We further study
   the implications of these three aspects of front dynamics to gradual
   regime shifts. We show that such shifts can occur due to the propagation
   of a perturbation beyond its original extent, that such a transition
   does not necessarily culminate in the alternative state, i.e. it may
   remain incomplete, and that the time it takes for a regime shift to
   occur can be changed by front manipulations. Since gradual regime shifts
   can take place far from the typical tipping point considered, early
   warning signals of an approaching tipping point would fail in predicting
   gradual regime shifts. A more relevant approach for these regime shifts
   may be the development of detection and prevention methods, which can be
   applied during an ongoing gradual regime shift due to its slow dynamics.
   We conclude with a discussion of the need to develop such methods and of
   other ecological contexts that may benefit from them.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation of the costs and outcomes associated with environmental
   policies and interventions is often required to inform public policy and
   allocate scarce resources. Methods to conduct assessments of
   cost-effectiveness have been developed in the context of
   pharmaceuticals, but have more recently been applied in public health,

   existing economic evaluation methodology has been explored in many

   make significant inroads into the evaluation of interventions and

Abstract = {{A stochastic ecological model with an integrated equilibrium temperature
   model was developed to predict microalgae growth and phosphorus removal
   in cold region waste stabilization ponds (WSPs). The model utilized a
   Monte Carlo simulation to account for parameter uncertainty. The
   equilibrium temperature model was parameterized using field data
   collected from two WSPs in Nunavut, Canada, from 2012 to 2014. The
   equilibrium temperature model provided good agreement with field data on
   a daily time step. The full model was run using historic (1956-2005)
   temperature and solar radiation data from five communities (Baker Lake,
   Cambridge Bay, Coral Harbour, Hall Beach, Resolute) in Nunavut, Canada.
   The communities represented a range of geographical locations and
   environmental conditions. Logistic regression on pooled model outputs
   showed that mean July temperature and mean treatment season temperature
   (June 1-September 15, ice-free period) provided the best predictors for
   microalgae growth. They had a predictive success rate of 93 and 88\%,
   respectively. The modelled threshold (50\% probability from the Monte
   Carlo simulation) for microalgae growth was 8.7 and 5.6 degrees C for
   the July temperature and mean treatment season temperature,
   respectively. The logistic regression was applied to each community
   (except Sanikiluaq) in Nunavut using historic climate data and a
   probability of microalgae growth was calculated. Based on the model
   results, soluble phosphorus concentrations consistent with secondary
   treatment could be achieved if WSP depth is less than 2m. The model
   demonstrated a robust method to predict whether a microalgae bloom will
   occur under a range of model parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The deposition of ambient submicron particles in the different parts of
   the human respiratory tract (HRT) was, for the first time, estimated for
   males and females from different age classes (children-adults-seniors)
   of urban population in the city of Thessaloniki, northern Greece, during
   the cold and the warm period of the year. Outdoor daily and hourly
   particle number doses in the different regions of the HRT, i.e., the
   extra-thoracic (ET), tracheobronchial (TB), and the acinar (AC) regions,
   were calculated by employing the Multiple-Path Particle Dosimetry (MPPD)
   model. Because of the absence of information being available for the
   hygroscopic properties of particles, three different particle
   hygroscopicity scenarios were considered: (i) non-hygroscopic (i.e., raw
   model estimations), (ii) nearly hydrophobic, and (iii) hygroscopic
   particles. When hygroscopic properties were considered, we found a
   remarkable reduction (up to 55\%) in the estimated total particle number
   doses in comparison to the non-hygroscopic particle scenario.
   Furthermore, we found that the size distribution pattern of the particle
   doses within the different parts of the HRT was strongly affected by
   particles' hygroscopic properties with the non-hygroscopic particle
   scenario significantly overestimating the particle doses in the
   sub-100-nm range, while underestimating the doses of larger particles.
   On the contrary, the deposition density appeared to be negligibly
   affected by the particles' hygroscopic properties, implying the
   existence of a possible threshold in the number of particles deposited
   per airway surface area. Similarly, the lobar particle number deposition
   fraction was unaffected by the hygroscopic properties of particles, as
   well as the ambient particle size distribution and the individuals'
   physiological parameters. The total particle number deposition doses
   estimated here are within the range of the corresponding values reported
   for other urban environments. It is hoped that our findings could
   contribute to better understanding of submicron particle exposure and
   add to the development of more sufficient methods to evaluate the
   related health impacts.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{694-715}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Timely detection of ecological regime shifts is a key problem for
   ecosystem managers, because changed ecosystem dynamics and function will
   usually necessitate a change in management strategies. However,
   currently available methods for detecting regime shifts depend on having
   multiple long time series data from both before and after the regime
   shift. This data requirement is prohibitive for many ecosystems. Here,
   we present a new approach for detecting regime shifts from
   one-dimensional spatial (transect) data from just a single time step
   either side of the transition. Characteristic length scale (CLS)
   estimation is a method of attractor reconstruction combined with
   nonlinear prediction that enables identification of the emergent scale
   at which deterministic behavior of the system is best observed.
   Importantly, previous studies show that a fundamental change in
   ecosystem dynamics, from one domain of attraction to another, is
   reflected in a change in the CLS, i.e., the approach enables
   distinguishing regime shifts from variability in dynamics around a
   single attractor. Until now the method required highly resolved
   two-dimensional spatial data, but here we adapted the approach so that
   the CLS can be estimated from one-dimensional transect data. We
   demonstrate its successful application to both model and real ecosystem
   data. In our model test cases, we detected change in the CLS in cases
   where the shape (topology) of the interaction network had changed,
   leading to a shift in community composition. In an examination of
   benthic transect data from four Indonesian coral reefs, changes in the
   CLS for two of the reefs indicate a regime shift. This new development
   in estimating CLSs makes it possible to detect regime shifts in systems
   where data are limited, removing ambiguity in the interpretation of
   community change.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation of freshwater ecosystems has become a common ecological
   and environmental problem globally. Owing to the complexity of
   biological communities, there remain tremendous technical challenges for
   investigating influence of environmental stressors (e.g., chemical
   pollution) on biological communities. High-throughput sequencing-based
   metabarcoding provides a powerful tool to reveal complex interactions
   between environments and biological communities. Among many technical
   issues, the clustering strategies for operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
   which are crucial for assessing biodiversity of communities, may affect
   final conclusions. Here, we used zooplankton communities along an
   environmental pollution gradient in the Chaobai River in Northern China
   to test different clustering strategies, including nonclustering and
   clustering with varied thresholds. Our results showed that though the
   number of OTUs estimated by nonclustering strategies and clustering
   strategies with divergence thresholds of 99\%-97\% largely varied, they
   were able to identify the same set of significant environmental and
   spatial variables responsible for geographical distributions of
   zooplankton communities. In addition, the ecological conclusions
   obtained by clustering thresholds of 99\%-97\% were consistent with
   nonclustering strategies, where for all eight clustering scenarios we
   detected that species sorting predicted by environmental variables
   overrode dispersal as the dominant factor in structuring zooplankton
   communities. However, clustering with the divergence thresholds of <95\%
   affected the environmental and spatial variables identified. We conclude
   that both newly developed nonclustering methods and traditional
   clustering methods with divergence thresholds >= 97\% were reliable to
   reveal mechanisms of complex community-environment interactions,
   although different clustering strategies could lead to largely varied
   biodiversity estimates such as those for alpha-diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrological models have been widely applied in flood forecasting, water
   resource management and other environmental sciences. Most hydrological
   models calibrate and validate parameters with available records.
   However, the first step of hydrological simulation is always to
   quantitatively and objectively split samples for use in calibration and
   validation. In this paper, we have proposed a framework to address this
   issue through a combination of a hierarchical scheme through trial and
   error method, for systematic testing of hydrological models, and
   hypothesis testing to check the statistical significance of
   goodness-of-fit indices. That is, the framework evaluates the
   performance of a hydrological model using sample splitting for
   calibration and validation, and assesses the statistical significance of
   the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index (E-f), which is commonly used to
   assess the performance of hydrological models. The sample splitting
   scheme used is judged as acceptable if the E-f values exceed the
   threshold of hypothesis testing. According to the requirements of the
   hierarchical scheme for systematic testing of hydrological models, cross
   calibration and validation will help to increase the reliability of the
   splitting scheme, and reduce the effective range of sample sizes for
   both calibration and validation. It is illustrated that the threshold of
   E-f is dependent on the significance level, evaluation criteria (both
   regarded as the population), distribution type, and sample size. The
   performance rating of E-f is largely dependent on the evaluation
   criteria. Three types of distributions, which are based on an
   approximately standard normal distribution, a Chi square distribution,
   and a bootstrap method, are used to investigate their effects on the
   thresholds, with two commonly used significance levels. The highest
   threshold is from the bootstrap method, the middle one is from the
   approximately standard normal distribution, and the lowest is from the
   Chi square distribution. It was found that the smaller the sample size,
   the higher the threshold values are. Sample splitting was improved by
   providing more records. In addition, outliers with a large bias between
   the simulation and the observation can affect the sample values of E-f,
   and hence the output of the sample splitting scheme. Physical hydrology
   processes and the purpose of the model should be carefully considered
   when assessing outliers. The proposed framework in this paper cannot
   guarantee the best splitting scheme, but the results show the necessary
   conditions for splitting schemes to calibrate and validate hydrological
   models from a statistical point of view.}},

Abstract = {{Halogenated chemicals including perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)
   represent an emerging class of endocrine-disrupting pollutants for human
   populations across the globe. Distress related to their environmental
   fate and toxicity has initiated several research projects, but the
   amount of experimental data available for these pollutants is limited.
   The objective of this study is to assess the toxicity of potentially
   ``safer{''} alternatives, in relation to their existing counterparts.
   Developmental toxicity data on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos of single
   and tertiary halogenated mixtures were modeled employing quantitative
   structure-toxicity relationship (QSTR) tool. The computed models are
   then employed for toxicity prediction of theoretically generated binary
   and tertiary mixtures (which have no experimental data) to check their
   possible threshold and mode of toxicity for future risk assessment.
   Further, for toxicity screening, we have prepared a huge external
   dataset consists of single (24), binary (276) and tertiary (2024)
   mixtures of PFASs. It was accomplished by combination method and
   predicted through developed models for interpretation of toxicity
   threats for individuals and mixtures along with identification of
   diverse range and combination of toxicity thresholds. We found that
   chemicals in mixtures displayed concentration addition of individual
   chemical suggesting a similar mode of toxic action and non interaction
   of chemicals. Not only that, mixtures of halogenated compounds including
   PFASs showed less toxicity than their single counterparts and the
   obtained toxicity trend is: Single chemical > Binary mixture > Tertiary

Abstract = {{Benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) belong to an important group of
   aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are usually emitted from
   various sources. BTX play a vital role in the tropospheric chemistry as
   well as pose health hazard to human beings. Thus, an investigation of
   ambient benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) was conducted at urban and
   rural sites of Gorakhpur for a span of one year in order to ascertain
   the contamination levels. The sampling of BTX was performed by using a
   low-flow SKC Model 220 sampling pump equipped with activated coconut
   shell charcoal tubes with a flow rate of 250 ml/min for 20-24 h. The
   analysis was in accordance with NIOSH method 1501. The efficiency of
   pump was checked weekly using regulated rotameters with an accuracy of
   +/- 1\%. The samples were extracted with CS2 with occasional agitation
   and analyzed by GC-FID. The total BTX concentration ranged from 3.4 mu g
   m(-3) to 45.4 mu gm(-3) with mean value 30.95 mu g m(-3) and median 24.8
   mu g m(-3). The mean concentration of total BTX was maximum during
   winter (393 mu g m(-3)), followed by summer (28.4 mu g m(-) (3)) and
   monsoon season (25.1 mu g m(-3)). The mean concentration of BD( at urban
   site (11.8 mu g m(-3)) was higher than that at rural site (8.8 mu g
   m(-3)). At both the sites, TSB and X/B ratios were highest in monsoon
   and lowest in winters. Toluene against benzene plot shows R-2 value of
   0.96 and 0.49 at urban and rural sites respectively. Higher R-2 value at
   urban site clearly indicates similar sources of emission for benzene and
   toluene. At both the sites, the estimated integrated lifetime cancer
   risk (ILTCR) for benzene exceeded the threshold value of 1E-06 whereas
   the individual hazard quotients (HQ) for BTX did not exceed unity at any
   of the sites. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although the impact of environmental regulation on industrial efficiency
   has been widely investigated in various industries, it remains largely
   unknown in the construction industry. Using 2011-2015 panel data of 30
   provinces and cities in China, this paper aims to reveal whether
   environmental regulation has an impact on regional construction
   efficiency. A 3-Stage DEA Model is used to measure the technical
   efficiency of regional construction industries influenced by
   environmental regulations. Then Hansen's (Hansen, 1999) threshold
   regression model is used to analyse the threshold effect of environment
   regulation on the efficiency of regional construction industry. A single
   threshold value of 0.014 is identified to be used to group China's 30
   provinces into high-regulation and low-regulation regions. The results
   show that environmental regulation has a significant impact on the
   efficiency of China's construction industry. Scale efficiency is the
   most affected. The technical efficiency of highly regulated provinces is
   less affected by environmental regulations. The findings provide a
   reference frame and analytical method for the analysis of construction
   efficiency of other developing countries, and provide practical

Abstract = {{Land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from satellite imagery is one
   of the most practical ways to consistently monitor urban thermal
   environment. Given the heterogeneous nature of urban landscape, an
   implicit assumption should be considered in remotely sensed LST
   determinations that a mixed urban land cover aggregation is the
   combination of its constituent components. Currently, the common LST
   retrieval method which utilize emissivity measures estimated by NDVI
   threshold method (NDVITHM), including mono window (MW), single channel
   (SC), and split window algorithms (SW), does not take into account
   heterogeneity of pixels. While in this study, a new approach, the
   mixture analysis of emissivity (MAoE), is proposed to calculate
   temperature by estimating pixel emissivity from mixed land cover
   classes. We conduct a comparison of six approaches by the combinations
   of three LST retrieval algorithms with NDVITHM and MAoE respectively.
   The differences among strategies are characterized and analyzed by
   comparing LST estimates from Landsat 8 thermal images. The LST gradients
   derived from transect analysis are found consistently similar for
   combinations of two LST algorithms (MW and SC) and the two emissivity
   estimation algorithms (MAoE and NDVITHM). LSTs derived from SW
   algorithms using band 10 have the highest mean values, while the SC
   algorithms have moderate mean values and the MW algorithms have the
   lowest values. Standard deviations of estimated LST from MAoE are
   smaller compared with NDVITHM methods, SC retrieval algorithm with MAoE
   has the smallest standard deviation, and NDVITHM temperature estimation
   could be more impacted by different land use land cover types.}},

   quantum dots carboxylate-coated, 25 mg L-1 > CdTe quantum dots
   polyethylene glycol-coated, 100 mg L-1. The MIC values were above the
   highest test concentration used (100 mg L-1) for CuO, TiO2, nanodiamonds

Title = {{Enhanced forest interior estimations utilizing lidar-assisted 3D forest
   cover map}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},

Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of forest interior is essential for large scale
   sustainable forest management. Conventional 2D forest cover maps only
   indicate the presence and absence of forests and may introduce quantity
   and allocation bias in the delineation of forest interior due to the
   inclusion of early successional/recently disturbed forests. We addressed
   this issue by utilizing both lidar data and National Land Cover Database
   (NLCD) to generate a 3D forest cover map in the forested region of
   western North Carolina, USA. We first classified forest cover as either
   early or late successional based on vertical structural information
   (using either a single-height threshold or a variable-height threshold
   by forest type). We then estimated forest interior based on these
   different forest cover classes and assessed disagreement in quantity and
   allocation of interior forests as determined using 2D forest cover maps.
   In addition, we determined spatial relationships between developed areas
   and forest interiors to evaluate the impact of landscape settings on the
   estimation of forest interior. Our results indicated that using a
   single-height threshold, the 3D forest cover map was able to distinguish
   early vs. late successional forests with a classification accuracy of
   96.6\%. A similar classification accuracy (94.6\%) was achieved when
   applying variable height thresholds by forest type. Based on the
   single-height threshold method, excluding early successional forests
   (6.4\% of all forested area) reduced estimates of forest interior by
   10.3\%, 9.6\% and 10.4\% at spatial resolutions of 4.4 ha, 39.7 ha and
   234 ha, respectively. Using variable-height threshold by forest type,
   the estimates of forest interior were approximately 1\% less than the
   estimates using the single-height threshold method due to the slightly
   decrease of the early successional forest classification (5.7\% of all
   forest area). Our results indicated the forest interior may be
   overestimated without accounting for successional stage. Moreover,
   geospatial distance analysis revealed the overestimation of forest
   interior to be most pronounced in highly fragmented areas. Our study
   demonstrated the advantage of considering 3D structural information for
   the accurate estimation of forest interior, particularly in areas
   already having fragmented forests. This information can be relatively
   easily obtained from lidar data. This 3D method will allow for the
   creation of high-accuracy forest interior maps that can help to answer a
   variety of ecological questions and improve forest management and
   conservation.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In order to assess the pollution levels and health risks of PM2.5-bound
   metals in Baoding City before and after the heating period, samples were
   collected in 2016 at Hebei University from September 25th to November
   14th during the non-heating period, and November 15th to December 26th
   during the heating period, respectively. ICP-MS was applied to analyze
   seven heavy metals (Cr, Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cd and Fe). The statistical
   analysis, enrichment factor (EF), pollution load index method, and Risk
   Assessment Method proposed by U.S. EPA were used to evaluate the
   non-carcinogenic risks of six of these heavy metals (Cr, Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni
   and Cd) and carcinogenic risks of three of these heavy metals (Cr, Ni
   and Cd). The results showed three main results. First, the average daily
   PM2.5 concentrations of the national air monitoring stations was 155.66
   g.m(-3) which was 2.08 times as high as that of the second level
   criterion in China (75 g.m(-3)) during the observation period. Compared
   with the non-heating period, all heavy metals concentrations increased
   during heating period. The growth rates of Pb and Ni were the highest
   and the lowest, which were 88.03 and 5.11 percent, respectively. Second,
   the results of enrichment factor indicated that the EF values of all
   heavy metals were higher during the heating period in comparison with
   during the non-heating period, but the degree of enrichment of all heavy
   metals remained unchanged. Not only those, Cr and Ni were minimally
   enriched and were affected by both human and natural factors, Pb, Cu and
   Zn were significantly enriched and were mainly affected by human
   factors, the enrichment of Cd was much higher than that of the other
   heavy metals, exhibiting extremely high enrichment, mainly due to human
   factors during the whole sampling period. The results of the pollution
   load index indicated that the proportions of the number of highly and
   very highly polluted PM2.5-bound metals were the highest during the
   heating period, while the proportion of moderately polluted PM2.5-bound
   metals was the highest during the non-heating period. The combined
   pollution degree of heavy metals was more serious during the heating
   period. Third, according to the health risk assessment model, we
   concluded that the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks caused by
   inhalation exposure were the highest and by dermal exposure were the
   lowest for all kinds of people. The overall non-carcinogenic risk of
   heavy metals via inhalation and subsequent ingestion exposure caused
   significant harm to children during the non-heating and the heating
   periods, and the risk values were 2.64, 4.47, 1.20 and 1.47,
   respectively. Pb and Cr exhibited the biggest contributions to the
   non-carcinogenic risk. All the above non-carcinogenic risks exceeded the
   standard limits suggested by EPA (HI or HQ < 1). The carcinogenic risk
   via inhalation exposure to children, adult men and women were 2.10 x
   10(-4), 1.80 x 10(-4), and 1.03 x 10(-4) during the non-heating period,
   respectively, and 2.52 x 10(-4), 2.16 x 10(-4) and 1.23 x 10(-4) during
   the heating period, respectively. All the above carcinogenic risks
   exceeded the threshold ranges (10(-6)similar to 10(-4)), and Cr posed a
   carcinogenic risk to all people.}},

Title = {{Coral reef applications of Sentinel-2: Coverage, characteristics,

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{216}},

Abstract = {{The Sentinel-2A and 2B Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) offers a
   specification of potential value toward a number of objectives in remote
   sensing of coral reefs. Coral reefs represent a unique challenge for
   remote sensing, being highly heterogeneous at metre scales and occurring
   at variable depths and water clarity regimes. However, conservation
   initiatives, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,
   add urgency to the need for the large scale environmental monitoring
   information that remote sensing can provide. In the quest to meet this
   challenge a range of satellite instruments have been leveraged, from
   Landsat to high spatial resolution sensors such as WorldView-2, toward
   objectives such as: mapping of bottom types, bathymetry, change
   detection, and detection of coral bleaching events. Sentinel-2A and 2B
   offer a new paradigm of available instruments, with a 5-day revisit, 10m
   multispectral spatial resolution and freely available data. Pre-launch
   simulation analyses by several of the authors suggested Sentinel-2 would
   have good performance for reef applications, in this paper we follow up
   on this study by reviewing the potential based on the substantial
   archive of actual data now available.
   First we determine to what extent the World's reefs are covered by
   Sentinel-2, since the mission requirements do not by default include all
   reefs. Secondly we review how a 5-day revisit translates to a usable
   acquisition rate of clear images, given that cloud and surface glint are
   common confounding factors. The usable acquisition rate is the real
   determinant of the objectives to which the data can be applied. Finally
   we apply current processing algorithms to Sentinel-2 data of several
   sites over the Great Barrier Reef, including physics-based bathymetry
   inversion and object-orientated benthic mapping. Landsat 8 OLI is most
   comparable current sensor to Sentinel-2 MSI, so direct comparisons and
   the possibilities for data synthesis are explored.
   Our findings confirm that Sentinel-2 has excellent performance for
   meeting several essential coral reef scientific and monitoring
   objectives. Taking into account cloud and sun glint, the usable
   acquisition rate for a large proportion of reefs is likely to be around
   20 clear images a year on average, giving a new potential for evaluation
   of short time-scale disturbances and impacts. The spatial resolution of
   10 m is a key threshold for delineating benthic features of interest
   such as coral structures, and there is evidence from image and field
   data that bleaching is detectable. Radiometrically Sentinel-2 data can
   support good results in physics-based methods, such as bathymetric
   mapping, comparable to Landsat 8 and WorldView-2. In addition the large
   scale acquisition area, provided by the 290 km wide swath, offers
   advantages over high spatial resolution imagery for mapping at
   multi-reef scales.
   Sentinel-2 data can be immediately leveraged with existing methods, to
   provide a new level of reef monitoring information compared to that
   previously available by remote sensing. Combined with Landsat 8 and the
   historical Landsat archive, the data collected today will be invaluable
   for decades or even centuries to come. In this context, the main
   downside of the Sentinel-2 mission is that approximately 12\% of the
   World's reefs currently lie outside the acquisition plan and are not
   imaged. Surprisingly, for a European initiative, coral reefs in European
   governed territories are among the worst served globally. These
   omissions, approximately only 1/200th of the currently imaged area,
   limit the global scope which otherwise would be one of Sentinel-2s
   greatest strengths.}},

Abstract = {{1. Recent advances in biologging have resulted in animal location data
   at unprecedentedly high temporal resolutions, sometimes many times per
   second. However, many current methods for analysing animal movement
   (e.g. step selection analysis or state-space modelling) were developed
   with lower-resolution data in mind. To make such methods usable with
   high-resolution data, we require techniques to identify features within
   the trajectory where movement deviates from a straight line.
   2. We propose that the intricacies of movement paths, and particularly
   turns, reflect decisions made by animals so that turn points are
   particularly relevant to behavioural ecologists. As such, we introduce a
   fast, accurate algorithm for inferring turning-points in high-resolution
   data. For analysing big data, speed and scalability are vitally
   important. We test our algorithm on simulated data, where varying
   amounts of noise were added to paths of straight-line segments
   interspersed with turns. We also demonstrate our algorithm on data of
   free-ranging oryx Oryx leucoryx. We compare our algorithm to existing
   statistical techniques for break-point inference.
   3. The algorithm scales linearly and can analyse several
   hundred-thousand data points in a few seconds on a mid-range desktop
   computer. It identified turnpoints in simulated data with complete
   accuracy when the noise in the headings had a standard deviation of +/-

   comparable accuracy to the existing algorithms tested, and is up to
   three orders of magnitude faster.
   4. Our algorithm, freely available in R and Python, serves as an initial
   step in processing ultra high-resolution animal movement data, resulting
   in a rarefied path that can be used as an input into many existing
   step-and-turn methods of analysis. The resulting path consists of points
   where the animal makes a clear turn, and thereby provides valuable data
   on decisions underlying movement patterns. As such, it provides an
   important breakthrough required as a starting point for analysing
   subsecond resolution data.}},

Abstract = {{1. The popularity of species distribution models (SDMs) and the
   associated stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs), as tools for
   community ecologists, largely increased in recent years. However, while
   some consensus was reached about the best methods to threshold and
   evaluate individual SDMs, little agreement exists on how to best
   assemble individual SDMs into communities, that is, how to build and
   assess S-SDM predictions.
   2. Here, we used published data of insects and plants collected within
   the same study region to test (a) if the most established thresholding
   methods to optimize single species prediction are also the best choice
   for predicting species assemblage composition, or if community-based
   thresholding can be a better alternative, and (b) whether the optimal
   thresholding method depends on taxa, prevalence distribution and/or
   species richness. Based on a comparison of different evaluation
   approaches, we provide guidelines for a robust community
   cross-validation framework, to use if spatial or temporal independent
   data are unavailable.
   3. Our results showed that the selection of the ``optimal{''} assembly
   strategy mostly depends on the evaluation approach rather than taxa,
   prevalence distribution, regional species pool or species richness. If
   evaluated with independent data or reliable cross-validation,
   community-based thresholding seems superior compared to single species
   optimisation. However, many published studies did not evaluate community
   projections with independent data, often leading to overoptimistic
   community evaluation metrics based on single species optimisation.
   4. The fact that most of the reviewed S-SDM studies reported over-fitted
   community evaluation metrics highlights the importance of developing
   clear evaluation guidelines for community models. Here, we move a first
   step in this direction, providing a framework for cross-validation at
   the community level.}},

Abstract = {{Rivers worldwide are impacted by human activities such as habitat
   degradation, habitat fragmentation, waterway flow regulation, and
   introduction of exotic species, which are responsible for the reduction
   or the disappearance of native species in many parts of the world. The
   Oglio River, a tributary of the Po River in Northern Italy, is a good
   example of a river with a long history of human alteration and where
   exotic invasions are present. We used data on water parameters and fish
   communities along the watercourse to investigate whether low flow
   conditions, degraded water quality, abundant exotic species, and the
   presence of migration barriers could be a disadvantage for native
   species. We used ordination methods (redundancy analysis), variance
   partitioning analysis, and the threshold indicator taxa analysis to
   explore changes in community composition and ecofunctional traits along
   an altitude gradient. We found that exotic species affected native ones
   more than water quality and hydromorphological parameters. Native
   species were most abundant in the upper reach of the Oglio River,
   despite low flow and shallow depth. Moreover, rheophilic and clear water
   native fish decreased rapidly in the lower reach of the river, where
   exotic species increased. This distribution could be explained by the
   presence of barriers in the middle reach, which block exotic species
   migrating upstream from the highly invaded Po River, and by a lower
   suitability of the upper reach for some exotic species. Our results
   provide a general description of the fish fauna of a strongly regulated
   river and can contribute to develop more effective fish and water
   management practices.}},

Abstract = {{AimSpecies richness is a measure of biodiversity often used in spatial
   conservation assessments and mapped by summing species distribution

   and conservation assessments. We sought to further the understanding of
   the sensitivity of hotspot delineation methods and conservation
   assessments to commission errors, and choice of threshold for hotspot
   delineation.
   LocationUnited States.
   MethodsWe created range maps and 30-m and 1-km resolution habitat maps
   for terrestrial vertebrates in the United States and generated species
   richness maps with each dataset. With the richness maps and the GAP
   Protected Areas Dataset, we created species richness hotspot maps and
   calculated the proportion of hotspots within protected areas;
   calculating protection under a range of thresholds for defining
   hotspots. Our method allowed us to identify the influence of commission
   errors by comparing hotspot maps.
   ResultsCommission errors from coarse spatial grain data and lack of
   porosity in the range data inflated richness estimates and altered their
   spatial patterns. Coincidence of hotspots from different data types was
   low. The 30-m hotspots were spatially dispersed, and some were very long
   distances from the hotspots mapped with coarser data. Estimates of
   protection were low for each of the taxa. The relationship between
   estimates of hotspot protection and threshold choice was nonlinear and
   inconsistent among data types (habitat and range) and grain size (30-m
   and 1-km).
   Main conclusionsCoarse mapping methods and grain sizes can introduce
   commission errors into species distribution data that could result in
   misidentifications of the regions where hotspots occur and affect
   estimates of hotspot protection. Hotspot conservation assessments are
   also sensitive to choice of threshold for hotspot delineation. There is
   value in developing species distribution maps with high resolution and
   low rates of commission error for conservation assessments.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of benthic invertebrates in streams receiving acidic
   metal-contaminated water over an 18-yr period revealed both degraded
   conditions and recovery along a network of downstream locations.
   Compared with reference streams, and over the course of clean-up
   remediation efforts below an abandoned open-pit sulfur mine in the
   central Sierra Nevada of California, improving water quality was
   accompanied by recovery of benthic communities at some sites. Years of
   high flow resulted in degraded biological status when acid mine drainage
   capture was incomplete and metal loading had increased with runoff.
   Seasonal patterns of recovery evident in the fall after the summer
   treatment season reverted in the next spring after overwinter periods
   when sources were not captured. As the metal load has been reduced,
   phased recovery of community structure, function, and similarity
   progressed toward that of reference assemblage taxonomic composition.
   From impacted communities dominated by relatively tolerant midges,
   reassembly involved an increase in density, return of long-lived taxa,
   an increased ratio of sensitive-to-tolerant forms, then overall
   diversity and community composition, and eventually large predators and

Abstract = {{Over the past decades, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) found
   in environmental matrices worldwide have raised concerns due to their
   toxicity, ubiquity and persistence. A widespread pollution of
   groundwater and surface waters caused by PFASs in Northern Italy has
   been recently discovered, becoming a major environmental issue, also
   because the exact risk for humans and nature posed by this contamination
   is unclear. Here, the Po River in Northern Italy was selected as a study
   area to assess the ecological risk posed by perfluoroalkyl acids
   (PFAAs), a class of PFASs, considering the noticeable concentration of
   various PFAAs detected in the Po waters over the past years. Moreover,
   the Po has a large environmental and socio-economic importance: it is
   the largest Italian river and drains a densely inhabited, intensely
   cultivated and heavily industrialized watershed. Predicted no-effect
   concentrations (PNECs) were derived using two regulated methodologies,
   assessment factors (AFs) and species sensitivity distribution (SSD),
   which rely on published ecotoxicological laboratory tests. Results were
   compared to those of a novel methodology using the mechanistic ecosystem
   model AQUATOX to compute PNECs in an ecologically-sound manner, i.e.
   considering physical, chemical, biological and ecological processes in
   the river. The model was used to quantify how the biomasses of the
   modelled taxa in the river food web deviated from natural conditions due
   to varying inputs of the chemicals. PNEC for each chemical was defined
   as the lowest chemical concentration causing a non-negligible yearly
   biomass loss for a simulated taxon with respect to a control simulation.
   The investigated PFAAs were Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and
   Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as long-chained compounds, and
   Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) as
   short-chained homologues. Two emerging contaminants, Linear Alkylbenzene
   Sulfonate (LAS) and triclosan, were also studied to assess the
   performance of the three methodologies for chemicals whose ecotoxicology
   and environmental fate are well-studied. The most precautionary approach
   was the use of AFs generally followed by SSD and then AQUATOX, except
   for PFOS, for which AQUATOX yielded a much lower PNEC compared to the
   other approaches since, unlike the other two methodologies, it
   explicitly simulates sublethal toxicity and indirect ecological effects.
   Our findings highlight that neglecting the role of ecological processes
   when extrapolating from laboratory tests to ecosystems can result in
   under-protective threshold concentrations for chemicals. Ecosystem
   models can complement existing laboratory-based methodologies, and the
   use of multiple methods for deriving PNECs can help to clarify
   uncertainty in ecological risk estimates.}},

   A case study in Vilnius (Lithuania)}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Direct health effects of extreme temperatures are a
   significant environmental health problem in Lithuania, and could worsen
   further under climate change. This paper attempts to describe the change
   in environmental temperature conditions that the urban population of
   Vilnius could experience under climate change, and the effects such
   change could have on excess heat-related and cold-related mortality in
   two future periods within the 21st century.
   Methods: We modelled the urban climate of Vilnius for the summer and
   winter seasons during a sample period (2009-2015) and projected
   summertime and wintertime daily temperatures for two prospective
   periods, one in the near (2030-2045) and one in the far future
   (2085-2100), under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5.
   We then analysed the historical relationship between temperature and
   mortality for the period 2009-2015, and estimated the projected
   mortality in the near future and far future periods under a changing
   climate and population, assuming alternatively no acclimatisation and
   acclimatisation to heat and cold based on a constant-percentile
   threshold temperature.
   Results: During the sample period 2009-2015 in summertime we observed an
   increase in daily mortality from a maximum daily temperature of 30
   degrees C (the 96th percentile of the series), with an average of around
   7 deaths per year. Under a no acclimatisation scenario, annual average
   heat-related mortality would rise to 24 deaths/year (95\% CI: 8.4-38.4)
   in the near future and to 46 deaths/year (95\% CI: 16.4-74.4) in the far
   future. Under a heat acclimatisation scenario, mortality would not
   increase significantly in the near or in the far future. Regarding
   wintertime cold-related mortality in the sample period 2009-2015, we
   observed increased mortality on days on which the minimum daily
   temperature fell below 12 degrees C (the 7th percentile of the series),
   with an average of around 10 deaths a year. Keeping the threshold
   temperature constant, annual average cold-related mortality would
   decrease markedly in the near future, to 5 deaths/year (95\% CI:
   0.8-7.9) and even more in the far future, down to 0.44 deaths/year (95\%
   C: 0.1-0.8). Assuming a ``middle ground{''} between the acclimatisation
   and non acclimatisation scenarios, the decrease in cold-related
   mortality will not compensate the increase in heat-related mortality.
   Conclusion: Thermal extremes, both heat and cold, constitute a serious
   public health threat in Vilnius, and in a changing climate the decrease
   in mortality attributable to cold will not compensate for the increase
   in mortality attributable to heat. Study results reinforce the notion
   that public health prevention against thermal extremes should be
   designed as a dynamic, adaptive process from the inception.}},

Abstract = {{Attention is increasingly being paid to low impact development (LID)
   practices in urban stormwater management. Because LID practices offer a
   wide variety of hydro-environmental benefits, it is often necessary to
   account for these benefits collectively in cost-benefit analysis and LID
   alternative selection. The conventional methods of quantifying these
   benefits, however, can hardly incorporate the preferences of decision
   makers, and commonly involve tedious parameter estimations. To address
   these shortcomings, this study adopts a relative performance evaluation
   method to assess the various hydro-environmental impacts of LID
   alternatives in small urban catchments. This study considers several
   categories of hydro-environmental impacts, including water balance
   impact, surface pollutant load abatement, and combined sewer overflow
   and flood risk mitigation. Several performance indicators are used for
   each impact category. The system-wide effectiveness of an LID
   alternative is then derived by the weighted aggregation of its indicator
   scores, which are obtained by comparing its performance with that of all
   of the other alternatives. The hydro-environmental impact of green roofs
   and bioretention cells of varying areas in New York City, U.S. are
   investigated in detail. The results suggest that a green roof that
   covers the whole catchment is as effective as a bioretention cell that
   covers 3\%-5\% of the catchment in terms of stormwater management, and
   that the effectiveness of a bioretention cell doubles when its surface
   area increases from 2\% to 10\% of the catchment area. These assessment
   results are influenced by catchment-specific assessment criteria (e.g.,
   the high flow threshold) and management interests, which suggests that
   design guidelines for different catchments should be tailored to their
   natural and drainage characteristics. The framework used in this study
   allows stakeholders' interests to be reflected in LID alternative
   selections and the implications of different design guidelines to be
   thoroughly investigated.}},

   different types of trade-offs, risk strategies, and the resulting
   spatial and statistical distribution of their composite scores. Four
   aggregation tools are investigated (Weighted Linear Combination, WLC;
   Ordered Weighted Average, OWA; Data Envelopment Analysis, DEA;
   Compromise Programming, CP) using an example of vulnerability to
   flooding in the eastern United States. The choice of aggregation tool
   affects vulnerability outcomes, decision risk strategies, and the
   prioritization of vulnerability reduction strategies. DEA produces the
   highest vulnerability scores, representing a risk averse strategy
   associated with pessimistic outcomes. WLC implies a neutral and fixed
   risk strategy. CP produces a range of outcomes from neutral (equivalent
   to the WLC) to pessimistic, depending on its parameters. OWA offers the
   highest flexibility to adjust the levels of trade-off and risk strategy,

   pessimistic. The units of analysis, when prioritized across the
   different aggregation tools, are more consistent for the top ranked

   Solid-phase extraction (SPE) method were used to extract OPEs from water

   associated with air pollution, with a large determination coefficient
   (BMA: 0.46, PCR: 0.51) and high model's posterior probability (0.47).
   The most reliable prediction model for pneumonia was indicated by the
   lowest Bayesian Information Criterion. Among the pollutants, particulate
   matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 mu m or less (PM10) was
   associated with serious health risks on evaluation, with the highest
   posterior inclusion probabilities (range, 80.20 to 100.00\%) and
   significantly positive correlation coefficients (range, 0.14 to 0.34, p
   < 0.05). In addition, excessive PM10 concentration (approximately 2.54
   times the threshold) and a continuous increase in mortality due to
   respiratory diseases (approximately 1.50-fold in 10 years) were also
   exhibited. Overall, the results of this study suggest that currently,
   socio-environmental policies and international collaboration to mitigate
   health effects of air pollution is necessary in Seoul, Korea. Moreover,
   consideration of uncertainty of the regression model, which was verified
   in this research, will facilitate further application of this approach
   and enable optimal prediction of interactions between human and
   environmental factors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There have been significant regime shifts in the ecosystem structure and
   function in a large number of lakes worldwide due to the increasing
   human disturbance and climate change in recent decades. It has become a
   critical issue in lake conservation and management to identify the
   characteristics of regime shifts in lakes and explore potential
   early-warning signals prior to regime shifts. However, research on
   identifying and predicting regime shifts in lakes is still a difficult
   task since recent modelling approaches cannot fully grasp the non-linear
   processes among multiple ecosystem components and the ecological time
   series data are too scarce to support the detection in most lakes. In
   this study, multi-proxy paleolimnological records were used to obtain
   long time-series ecological data and determine the inflection points of
   regime shifts in the Baiyangdian Lake, northern China. First, the
   sediment chronology was established, and macrophyte pollen as well as
   nutrient conditions in each dated sediment layer were identified. Then
   the heuristic segmentation algorithm and Pettitt test were used to
   determine the most significant inflection points of regime shifts.
   Additionally, multiple early-warning indicators including variance,
   autocorrelation and skewness were used to test their ability to forecast
   the major ecosystem regime shift. Results show that the most important
   abrupt change in the Baiyangdian Lake occurred in the early 19605. The
   increasing variance coupled with decreasing autocorrelation and skewness
   started in 1-16 years before this regime shift, which is consistent with
   a flickering phenomenon rather than critical slowing down. The detection
   results of regime shifts and early-warning signals can provide valuable
   reference in- formation for the lake management and aquatic ecosystem
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, bridges have played a significant role in human transportation
   networks. However, less attention has been paid to the bridge extraction
   from the countryside environment. This paper aims to propose a
   three-step method for the bridge extraction from airborne LiDAR point
   clouds. First, we propose a chain-code-based method to delimit
   land/water interface from the input scene. Second, we perform an angle
   testing process to extract candidate bridge points based on the
   shoreline delimitation result. Third, we calculate the cost of paths
   across the water body. A path whose cost is less than an adaptive
   threshold will be selected as a bridge path. The main contribution of
   this paper is that we formulate an energy function to calculate the cost
   of each potential bridge path. The optimal path, which achieves the
   minimum cost, is solved by the proposed minimum-cost path model. The
   developed extraction method does not rely on the geometric shape of
   rivers and works well in different types of bridges. Experiments show
   that the presented method succeeds to obtain all bridges in six small

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to identify the concentrations, sources,
   and potential ecological and health risks of heavy metals in soils from
   a typical industrial area in Shanghai, China. A total of 28 surface soil
   samples were collected and analyzed for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Zn, and
   Hg from the BAO steel industry in June and July 2016. Classic
   multivariate statistical and geostatistical analysis methods were used
   to detect the sources of heavy metals, and the ecological risk index
   (RI) and hazard index (HI) were calculated to assess the potential
   ecological and health risks. The results showed significant pollution
   levels, which were derived from the industrial production process and
   closely related to the spatial layout of the functional areas of the
   industry. The ecological risk assessment indicated that a very high
   concentration zone with values ranging from 2045 to 3417 mg kg(-1)
   represented considerable ecological risk in the range of 300 to 600. The
   main dominant factor affecting the ecological risk is toxicity rather
   than concentration. The health risk assessment indicated that
   noncarcinogenic risk was mainly caused by Cr, and the average HI value
   for adults was 6.48, while it was 39.01 for children. Thus, children
   face higher threats to heavy metals in soils. The average carcinogenic
   risk values for Ni, Cr, Cd, and As were 7.97E-09, 5.2E-07, 2.1E-10, and
   2.1E-09, respectively, all of which were below the threshold values

Abstract = {{Early warning signals (EWS) are statistical indicators that a rapid
   regime shift may be forthcoming. Their development has given ecologists
   hope of predicting rapid regime shifts before they occur. Accurate
   predictions, however, rely on the signals being appropriate to the
   system in question. Most of the EWS commonly applied in ecology have
   been studied in the context of one specific type of regime shift (the
   type brought on by a saddle-node bifurcation, at which one stable
   equilibrium point collides with an unstable equilibrium and disappears)
   under one particular perturbation scheme (temporally uncorrelated noise
   that perturbs the net population growth rate in a density independent
   way). Whether and when these EWS can be applied to other ecological
   situations remains relatively unknown, and certainly underappreciated.
   We study a range of models with different types of dynamical transitions
   (including rapid regime shifts) and several perturbation schemes
   (density-dependent uncorrelated or temporally-correlated noise) and test
   the ability of EWS to warn of an approaching transition. We also test
   the sensitivity of our results to the amount of available pre-transition
   data and various decisions that must be made in the analysis (i.e. the
   rolling window size and smoothing bandwidth used to compute the EWS). We
   find that EWS generally work well to signal an impending saddle-node
   bifurcation, regardless of the autocorrelation or intensity of the
   noise. However, EWS do not reliably appear as expected for other types
   of transition. EWS were often very sensitive to the length of the
   pre-transition time series analyzed, and usually less sensitive to other
   decisions. We conclude that the EWS perform well for saddle-node
   bifurcation in a range of noise environments, but different methods
   should be used to predict other types of regime shifts. As a
   consequence, knowledge of the mechanism behind a possible regime shift
   is needed before EWS can be used to predict it.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: This study presents a bioclimate modelling approach, using
   responses to extreme climate events, rather than historical
   distributional associations, to project future species vulnerability and
   refugia. We aim to illustrate the compounding effects of groundwater
   loss and climate on species vulnerability.
   Location: California, USA.
   Methods: As a case study, we used the 2012-2015 California drought and
   resulting extensive dieback of blue oak (Quercus douglasii). We used
   aerial dieback surveys, downscaled climate data and subsurface water
   change data to develop boosted regression tree models identifying key
   thresholds associated with dieback throughout the blue oak distribution.
   We (1) combined observed dieback-climatic threshold relationships with
   climate futures to anticipate future areas of vulnerability and (2) used
   satellite-derived measurements of subsurface water loss in
   drought/dieback modelling to capture the mediating effect of groundwater
   on species response to climatic drought.
   Results: A model including climate, climate anomalies and subsurface
   water change explained 46\% of the variability in dieback. Precipitation
   in 2015 and subsurface water change accounted for 62.6\% of the modelled
   probability of dieback. We found an interaction between precipitation
   and subsurface water in which dieback probability increased with low
   precipitation and subsurface water loss. The relationship between
   precipitation and dieback was nonlinear, with 99\% of dieback occurring
   in areas that received <363 mm precipitation. Based on a MIROC\_rcp85
   future climate scenario, relative to historical conditions, 13\% of the
   blue oak distribution is predicted to experience more frequent years
   below this precipitation threshold by mid-century and 81\% by end of
   century.
   Main conclusions: As ongoing climate change and extreme events impact
   ecological processes, the identification of thresholds associated with
   observed dieback may be combined with climate futures to help identify
   vulnerable populations and refugia and prioritize climate change-related
   conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Water resource development on rivers significantly affects life cycles
   of species reliant on wetlands. However, assessing ecological impacts is
   often difficult because they are realised over long-time periods and
   large spatial scales, particularly on highly variable dryland rivers.
   Thirty percent of all Ramsar wetlands are in drylands. We examined the
   effects of diversions of water upstream on colonial waterbird breeding
   at the Narran Lakes, supplied by a highly variable dryland river. Narran
   Lakes is an important Ramsar-listed wetland in Australia for its
   provision of habitat for wetland fauna during key life history stages,
   including colonially breeding waterbirds. We use historical ibis
   breeding data over five decades (1970-2016) to determine the flow
   requirements for colonial waterbird breeding and modelled the impacts of
   water resource management options (current and restoration) on breeding.
   We identified thresholds (> 154,000 ML in 90 days with a secondary
   threshold of > 20,000 ML in the first 10 days) of river flow volume
   necessary to stimulate breeding. Water resource development reduced the
   frequency of large flows resulting in ibis breeding by 170\%, from 1 in
   4.2 years to 1 in 11.4 years. Restoration efforts by government to
   recover water for the environment was predicted to improve colonial
   waterbird breeding frequency associated with large flow events to 1 in
   6.71 years, representing a 59\% reduction from pre-development periods.
   Our framework has global application as a method for identifying
   long-term impacts of water resource development on key Ramsar wetland
   areas. This is important as few mechanisms exist for assessing impacts
   and identifying restoration options on the listed criteria for many

Abstract = {{Environmental risk assessment (ERA) of chemicals relies on the
   combination of exposure and effects assessment. Exposure concentrations
   are commonly estimated using mechanistic fate models, but the effects
   side is restricted to descriptive statistical treatment of toxicity
   data. Mechanistic effect models are gaining interest in a regulatory
   context, which has also sparked discussions on model quality and good
   modeling practice. Proposals for good modeling practice of effect models
   currently focus very much on population and community models, whereas
   effects models also exist at the individual level, falling into the
   category of toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) models. In contrast to
   the higher-level models, TKTD models are usually completely
   parameterized by fitting them to experimental data. In fact, one of
   their explicit aims is to replace descriptive methods for data analysis.
   Furthermore, the construction of these models does not fit into an
   orderly modeling cycle, given that most TKTD models have been under
   continuous development for decades and are being applied by many
   different research groups, for many different purposes. These aspects
   have considerable consequences for the application of frameworks for
   model evaluation. For example, classical sensitivity analysis becomes
   rather meaningless when all model parameters are fitted to a data set.
   We illustrate these issues with the General Unified Threshold model for

Abstract = {{Analysis of microbial community structure by multivariate ordination
   methods, using data obtained by high-throughput sequencing of amplified

   rather than being based on explicit knowledge. In this study, we explore
   the extent to which ordination results are affected by variation in

   from nine microbial community studies, representing different sampling
   designs, spatial scales and ecosystems, were subjected to clustering
   into OTUs at seven different similarity thresholds (clustering
   thresholds) ranging from 87\% to 99\% sequence similarity. The 63 data
   sets thus obtained were subjected to parallel DCA and GNMDS ordinations.
   The resulting community structures were highly similar across all
   clustering thresholds. We explain this pattern by the existence of
   strong ecological structuring gradients and phylogenetically diverse
   sets of abundant OTUs that are highly stable across clustering
   thresholds. Removing low-abundance, rare OTUs had negligible effects on
   community patterns. Our results indicate that microbial data sets with a

Abstract = {{Computer controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM) is a

   two-stage particle classification procedure based on elemental
   compositions of individual particles. A rule based classifier is applied
   in the first stage to form the main classes consisting of particles
   containing the same elements. Only elements with concentrations above a
   threshold of 5 wt\% are considered. In the second stage, data of each
   main class are isometrically log-ratio transformed and then clustered
   into subclasses, using a robust, model-based method. Single particles
   which are too far away from any more densely populated region are
   excluded during training, preventing these particles from distorting the
   definition of the sufficiently populated subclasses. The classifier was
   trained with over 55,000 single particles from 83 samples of manifold
   environments, resulting in 227 main classes and 465 subclasses in total.
   All these classes are checked manually by inspecting the ternary plot
   matrix of each main class. Regardless of the size of training data, some

Abstract = {{The heavy-tailed distribution of the data of organic pollution in soils
   can raise specific problems in estimating and mapping the
   concentrations. Some high values often highly impact the sample
   variogram and extend the pollution hot-spots on the estimation maps.
   Non-linear geostatistical models, such as the anamorphosed Gaussian
   model, have been proposed in the 70's. They allow a consistent estimate
   of the concentrations and the probability that the concentrations exceed
   a cut-off. These well-founded methods are rarely used by environmental
   consultants, mainly because of time constraints and because the
   hypotheses of the models are not always satisfied.
   To estimate the concentrations, an empirical method widely used by
   environmental consultants consists of truncating the high values to gain
   robustness in the variogram analysis. The truncation value is arbitrary,
   even if it has a strong influence on the estimates of the
   concentrations. Proposed to handle heavy-tailed distributions of ore
   grades, the top-cut model (Rivoirard et al., 2013) justifies the use of
   truncated values but corrects the underestimation of the mean caused by
   truncation.
   In this model, the decomposition of the variable into three components
   (the truncated value, a weighted indicator at the top-cut threshold and
   a residual) makes the variographic study more robust and guides choosing
   the top-cut threshold.
   In the case of a chlorinated solvent contamination, a detailed
   comparison between several estimation methods is performed: ordinary
   kriging, kriging after truncation of the highest concentrations and
   estimation within the top-cut model, with structured or pure nugget
   residual. A sensitivity study to the top-cut threshold is realized. The
   results of two implementations of the cross-validation are compared.
   The top-cut model with nugget residual appears to be robust, even if the

Abstract = {{The concentration of salts in streams is increasing world-wide making
   freshwater a declining resource. Developing thresholds for freshwater
   with low specific conductivity (SC), a measure of dissolved ions in
   water, may protect high quality resources that are refugia for aquatic
   life and that dilute downstream waters. In this case example, methods
   are illustrated for estimating protective levels for streams with low
   SC. The Cascades in the Pacific Northwest of the United States of
   America was selected for the case study because a geophysical model
   indicated that the SC of freshwater streams was likely to be very low.
   Also, there was an insufficient range in the SC data to accurately
   derive a criterion using the 2011, US Environmental Protection Agency
   field-based extirpation concentration distribution method. Instead,
   background and a regression model was used to estimate chronic and acute
   SC levels that could extirpate 5\% of benthic invertebrate genera.
   Background SC was estimated at the 25th centile (33 mu S/cm) of the
   measured data and used as the independent variable in a least squares
   empirical background-to-criteria (B-C) model. Because no comparison
   could be made with effect levels estimated from a paired SC and
   biological data set from the Cascades, the lower 50\% prediction limit
   (PL) was identified as an example chronic water quality criterion (97 mu
   S/cm). The maximum exposure threshold was estimated at the 90th centile
   SC of streams meeting the chronic SC level. The example acute SC level
   was 190 mu S/cm. Because paired aquatic life and SC data are often
   sparse, the B-C method is useful for developing SC criteria for other
   systems with limited data. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In order to save potable water, this study aims to evaluate
   the contamination of soil and Capsicum annuum L. (chilli) watered with

   Methods: The appropriateness of wetland outflow for irrigation when
   applying reused wastewater with high contamination of minerals and
   pathogens was assessed. The impact of wastewaters pre-treated by various
   wetlands on soil and harvest was tested in terms of mineral and
   biological contamination risk. Results: The wetlands met the standards
   for irrigation water for most water quality variables. However, the
   thresholds for key water quality parameters were significantly (p <
   0.05) exceeded. The highest values for total coliforms,
   ammonium-nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were 157,072 CFU/100 mL, 8.5
   mg/L, 5.0 mg/L, and 7.0 mg/L, respectively. The harvest was moderately
   polluted only by zinc according to vegetable quality standards

Abstract = {{Understanding the physical and biological mechanisms contributing to
   flow velocity-ecology relationships is crucial for successful river
   management. The application of an ecological traits-based approach
   offers the potential to explore mechanistic linkages between aquatic
   communities and a hydrological gradient. To date, however, studies
   focused on identifying these relationships have been limited by a lack
   of large-scale, long-term biological data. To address this gap at a
   scale relevant for water policy management, we employed data from a
   large-scale standardised benthic monitoring programthe Canadian Aquatic
   Biomonitoring Networkobtained from wadeable river sites across Canada.
   We applied the Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis method to quantify the
   response of the macroinvertebrate community, expressed as traditional
   taxonomic information and also as ecological traits, along a flow
   velocity gradient in reference and potential reference sites. Five key
   findings emerged: (1) using taxa and trait modalities revealed different
   flow velocity thresholds, (2) trait flow velocity indicators were less
   variable than taxon indicators, especially for positively responding
   trait modalities, (3) labile and non-labile trait modalities
   demonstrated highly similar patterns along the flow velocity gradient,
   (4) taxa from 12 different orders responded negatively to flow velocity,
   while only EPT taxa and some dipterans responded positively to flow
   velocity, and (5) traits related to mobility and ecology (e.g. climber
   and swimmer habits, preference of cold-cool eurythermal water and
   ability to survive desiccation) tended to respond positively to flow
   velocity, while traits related to morphology, life history and ecology
   (e.g. sprawler and burrower habits, preference for warm eurythermal
   water and inability to survive desiccation) tended to respond negatively
   to flow velocity. Providing ecologically based flow management targets
   can improve management plans, anticipate ecosystem consequences of
   anthropogenic change and support the development of policies to mitigate
   anthropogenic flow alteration. While our taxon and trait modality flow
   indicators were developed for Canadian watersheds, our methods to
   develop flow indicators and thresholds are transferrable to other
   systems where long-term biomonitoring programs are being developed,
   underscoring the need for long-term biomonitoring programs to support
   better ecosystem management.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{553-559}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   The functional advantages of arsenic (As) hyperaccumulation by plants
   are poorly understood. One proposed benefit, termed elemental
   allelopathy, occurs when hyperaccumulated As is cycled from the plant
   back into the top layer of soil, allowing As hyperaccumulators to gain
   an advantage over intolerant species by increasing soil As
   concentrations ({[}As]) underneath their canopy. To date, there are no
   studies that detail the presence of increased soil {[}As] associated
   with As hyperaccumulators. In this study, we documented variation in the
   soil {[}As] associated with the Chinese brake fern, Pteris vittata L.
   and also compared the effects of environmentally relevant soil and
   solution {[}As] on competitor plant growth.
   Methods
   Four populations of P. vittata were identified in central Florida, USA.
   P. vittata tissue samples and soil samples were collected at the base of
   and at 3 m away from ferns in each population (n = 36). Five sample
   locations were randomly selected from each site, and soils from the base
   and 3 m away from each fern were collected to examine the effects of
   naturally occurring soil {[}As] on the germination and growth of a
   potential competitor plant (Oxalis stricta). Solutions with increasing
   {[}As] were also used to examine the threshold for negative effects of
   {[}As] on O. stricta growth. {[}As] were measured using inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
   Important Findings
   Overall, soil {[}As] from the base of ferns was nearly twice that of
   soil 3 m away indicating that ferns hyperaccumulate As. However, ferns
   and their associated soil, contained different {[}As] depending on their
   collection site, indicating that these populations accumulate and use
   {[}As] differently. O. stricta growth decreased and germination was
   delayed as solution and soil {[}As] increased. However, the relative
   distance from the fern that the soil was collected from did not affect
   growth, which would be expected with elemental allelopathy. Our results
   show that P. vittata is associated with higher soil {[}As] and these
   concentrations are sufficient to inhibit growth of competitors. However,
   the absence of a strong inhibitory relationship associated with
   proximity to the fern across all locations suggests that the possible
   functional advantages of elemental allelopathy may depend on site
   specific characteristics.}},

   Perspective of Economic, Environmental and Overall Performances}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The economic and environmental performances of the swine farming
   industry have always resulted in heated discussions in developing
   countries. Exploring the relationship between these features and the
   producers' overall performance is the focus of this paper. For
   constructing multi-objective features that include the above features, a
   compromise approach for optimization is taken into consideration. For
   classifying the overall performance into different levels and detecting
   the effect of economic and environmental features on such features, an
   iteration scheme is developed in which the overall performance is
   treated as a target label. By neglecting this target label, a k-means
   clustering method is then used to help predict the producer's overall
   performance given their economic and environmental features. In data
   pre-processing, correlation analysis for feature selection shows that
   the producer's pollution emission and received regulation intensity
   largely affect its overall performance, while profit is found to be
   negatively correlated with pollution emission as regulation intensity is
   neglected. The classification result derived from the Silhouette
   Coefficient shows that the data set can be efficiently split into
   different groups in terms of the producer's overall performance. The
   average distance between the objects in the low-performance group is
   larger than that of the high-performance group. The threshold position
   between the two groups is found to be largely dependent on the features
   of pollution emission and regulation intensity. The clustering result
   obtained by the k-means method shows good effectiveness and efficiency
   in separating the objects into different groups based on various
   features other than the overall performance. In 2- and 3-cluster cases,
   the result also shows evidence of the impact of economic and
   environmental features on the clustering result. The cross-validation
   analysis under a set of randomly chosen splitting points shows an
   increasing out-of-sample prediction quality with increases in training
   sample size. As one of the by-products of this paper, the geographical
   distribution in the clustering result is found partially consistent with
   the official report from Chinas central government regarding
   advantageous regions within the industry. In addition to current
   research, the ease of using the knowledge obtained in this paper for
   transfer learning is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Rubber plantations have expanded at an unprecedented rate in Southeast

   time-series data derived from spatially explicit ESS models (InVEST)

   potential tipping points (TPs) in the supply of ESS under two rubber
   plantation expansion scenarios. TPs were defined as any situation in
   which the state of a system is changed through positive feedback as a
   result of accelerating changes. The TP analysis included hydrological,
   agronomical, and climate-regulation ESS, as well as multiple facets of
   biodiversity (habitat quality for vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant
   species). We identified regime shifts indicating potential tipping
   points, which were linked to abrupt changes in rubber yields, in both
   scenarios at varying spatial scales. With this study, we provide an
   easily applicable method for regional policy making and land use

Abstract = {{The phylogenetic and population genetic structure of symbiotic

   among- and within-species genetic structure for Lophodermium, a genus of
   fungal endophytes whose evolutionary analyses have been limited by the
   scarcity of informative markers. The protocol avoids expensive barcoded
   adapters and incorporates universal indexes for multiplexing. We tested
   for reproducibility and functionality by comparing shared loci from
   sample replicates and assessed the effects of numbers of ambiguous sites
   and clustering thresholds on coverage depths, number of shared loci
   among samples, and phylogenetic reconstruction. Errors between technical
   replicates were minimal. Relaxing the quality-filtering criteria
   increased the mean coverage depth per locus and the number of loci
   recovered within a sample, but had little effect on the number of shared
   loci across samples. Increasing clustering threshold decreased the mean
   coverage depth per cluster and increased the number of loci recovered
   within a sample but also decreased the number of shared loci across
   samples, especially among distantly related species. The combination of
   low similarity clustering (70\%) and relaxed quality-filtering (allowing
   up to 30 ambiguous sites per read) performed the best in phylogenetic
   analyses at both recent and deep genetic divergences. Hence, this method
   generated sufficient number of shared homologous loci to investigate the
   evolutionary relationships among divergent fungal lineages with small

   structure within species that correlated with ecological traits,
   providing valuable insights into their cryptic life histories.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming at the rapid identification of rural buildings in complex

Abstract = {{In this study, we propose amplification factors of single conical piles
   with different heights and sizes to describe wind erosion acceleration
   effects of piles compared to flat erodible surfaces. It is not difficult
   using traditional wind erosion models to estimate wind erosion of flat
   agricultural land or pastoral surfaces. However, in the current form
   these models cannot be used for elevated surfaces such as dunes or
   piles, which may lead to more serious dust emission and air pollution. A
   computational fluid dynamics simulation was used to refine a wind
   erosion estimation method of pile from the US Environmental Protection
   Agency (USEPA) by dividing the pile surface into multiple subareas with
   constant wind speed for each subarea and then obtaining ratios of pile
   erosion to the corresponding flat surface by calculating the total
   erosion rate of the pile and that of a flat surface with the same floor
   area. The ratios as amplification factors, E-amp, for six pile sizes
   (from 1 to 12 m) and five wind speed scenarios covering most erosive
   daily wind speeds from 824 stations throughout China were analyzed and
   fitted to equations to enable consideration of other heights and wind
   speed conditions. The changing patterns of the factors were verified
   using experimental surveys of two plots via the structure-from-motion
   photogrammetry method, which generated high-resolution digital elevation
   maps and detected detailed erosion changes. The erosion from a stockpile
   surface was found to be 2.52 to 7.16 times that from a flat surface with
   the same floor area, and the influence of pile height on amplification
   factor could be expressed by a logarithmic equation. These factors can
   be easily applied to estimate pile erosion by multiplying them by wind
   erosion results for flat surfaces obtained from other indexes or models.
   The procedure described in this paper can be extended to consider
   amplification or reduction effects of dunes, hills, piles, pits, and
   gullies with different shapes or configurations in relation to wind
   erosion. Furthermore, the reliability of wind erosion estimation over
   complex surfaces can be improved to implement specific soil conservation
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{Information diffusion techniques and Monte Carlo methods have been
   widely used in solving all kinds of problems of small samples with
   incomplete data in the field of natural disaster risk assessment such as
   environmental resource rating, flood monitoring and temperature
   changing. Data are not the only thing that matters for natural disaster
   risk assessment, but with enough data, we can accurately predict the
   time, place, scale and loss of future disasters. It is important to
   simulate the complete data scene when there is a minimum sample size. In
   this paper, we collect temperature data from 3050 meteorological
   stations in China and use the Monte Carlo simulation method to
   investigate the effect of sample size on estimating the normal
   information diffusion. The results show that (1) for the same sample,
   the information diffusion method is significantly better than the
   traditional histogram method. (2) Using the hard histogram estimation
   method, the recommended sample size is 85 or more, which is slightly
   larger than the traditional threshold value (i.e., 30), while using the
   information diffusion estimation method, the recommended sample size
   decreases to 45 or more. (3) Simulation experiments show that, with
   insufficient samples, both estimation methods, i.e., the information
   diffusion and the traditional histogram methods become invalid because
   of its poor correlation, low robustness, high RMSE and variance values.
   These results indicate that the Monte Carlo simulation method and
   information diffusion technique have certain practical reference value
   in the research of natural disaster risk assessment in the case of a

Abstract = {{Aim: Climate change affects forest functioning not only through direct
   physiological effects such as modifying photosynthesis and growing
   season lengths, but also through indirect effects on community
   composition related to species extinctions and colonizations. Such
   indirect effects remain poorly explored in comparison with the direct
   ones. Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) studies commonly examine
   the effects of species loss by eliminating species randomly. However,
   species extinctions caused by climate change will depend on the species'
   vulnerability to the new environmental conditions, thus occurring in a
   specific, non-random order. Here, we evaluated whether successive tree
   species extinctions, according to their vulnerability to climate change,
   impact forest functions differently than random species losses.
   Location: Eleven temperate forests across a gradient of climatic
   conditions in central Europe.
   Methods: We simulated tree community dynamics with a forest succession
   model to study the impact of species loss on the communities'
   aboveground biomass, productivity and temporal stability. Tree species
   were removed from the local pool (1) randomly, and according to (2)
   their inability to be recruited under a warmer climate or (3) their
   increased mortality under drier conditions.
   Results: Results showed that non-random species loss (i.e., based on
   their vulnerability to warmer or drier conditions) changed forest
   functioning at a different rate, and sometimes direction, than random
   species loss. Furthermore, directed extinctions, unlike random,
   triggered tipping points along the species loss process where forest
   functions were strongly impacted. These tipping points occurred after
   fewer extinctions in forests located in the coldest areas, where
   ecosystem functioning relies on fewer species.
   Main conclusions: We showed that the extinction of species in a
   deterministic and mechanistically motivated order, in this case the
   species vulnerability to climate change, strengthens the selection
   effect of diversity on ecosystem functioning. BEF studies exploring the
   impact of species loss on ecosystem functioning using random extinctions
   thus possibly underestimate the potential effect of biodiversity loss
   when driven by a directional force, such as climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting and quantifying environmental thresholds is frequently an
   important step in understanding ecological responses to environmental
   stressors. We discuss two statistical issues often encountered in
   threshold detection and quantification when statistical null hypothesis
   testing is used as a main analytical tool. The hidden
   multiple-comparison trap (leading to a much higher risk of a false
   detection) and Raven's paradox (rendering a ``detection{''} meaningless)
   are often obscured when statistical hypothesis testing is used as part
   of a more elaborate model, especially models based on computer-intensive
   methods. Using two examples, we show that the hidden multiple-comparison
   trap can be exposed using computer simulation to estimate the
   probability of making a false detection; Raven's paradox can be avoided
   by clearly stating the null and alternative hypotheses using scientific
   terms to substantiate that the rejection of the null is equivalent to
   proving that the alternative of interest is true. The hidden
   multiple-comparison trap implies that a null hypothesis testing based on
   a computer-intensive method should be used with caution. The implication
   of Raven's paradox requires that we focus on providing evidence
   supporting the proposed hypothesis or model, rather than seeking
   evidence against the frequently irrelevant null hypothesis. These two
   problems, and many others related to null hypothesis testing, suggest
   that statistical hypothesis testing should be used only as a component
   of the body of evidence, perhaps, as the devil's advocate.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating wildlife abundance is central to conservation. We compared
   two widely practiced standards for counting animals - aerial strip
   surveys and ground line transects - with interpreted counts of animal
   tracks. At equal sampling intensity in semiarid savanna with good
   visibility all three methods produced similar population estimates and
   precision for six large herbivores. This comparison adds empirical
   support for the use of track count data to estimate population density
   rather than being restricted to ambiguous indices of relative abundance.
   Although expected to capture more species than aerial surveys, we found
   line transects limiting because encounter rates by direct sightings were
   relatively low; a minimum threshold 40 observations was achieved for
   only 1/3 of antelope species in 648.4 km of transect. By contrast,
   animal track counts returned exceedingly high encounter rates that
   allowed estimation of abundance for the entire large predator-prey
   community and mapping density-distributions more completely. Unlike
   aerial surveys conducted by Botswana's wildlife authority, the track
   survey provided opportunity to involve local people in the research
   process. The track survey cost 40\% less than the aerial survey, and
   could be reduced a further 3-fold if trackers collected data
   autonomously without motor vehicles. Counting animals by their tracks is
   ultimately constrained to regions with appropriate substrates. However,
   in suitable environments like the Kalahari, we suggest that a citizen
   science driven by expert local trackers could ultimately replace
   conventional wildlife counts, generating knock-on benefits to
   conservation beyond improved data.}},

Volume = {{628-629}},

Abstract = {{Since 1950, increase in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) river loadings
   in the North-East Atlantic (NEA) continental seas has induced a deep
   change in the marine coastal ecosystems, leading to eutrophication
   symptoms in some areas. In order to recover a Good Ecological Status
   (GES) in the NEA, as required by European Water Framework Directive
   (WFD) and Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), reductions in N-
   and P-river loadings are necessary but they need to be minimal due to
   their economic impact on the farming industry. In the frame of the
   ``EMoSEM{''} European project, we used two marine 3D ecological models
   (ECO-MARS3D, MIRO\&CO) covering the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel
   and the southern North Sea to estimate the contributions of various
   sources (riverine, oceanic and atmospheric) to the winter nitrate and
   phosphate marine concentrations. The various distributed descriptors
   provided by the simulations allowed also to find a log-linear
   relationship between the 90th percentile of satellite-derived
   chlorophyll concentrations and the ``fully bioavailable{''} nutrients,
   i.e. simulated nutrient concentrations weighted by light and
   stoichiometric limitation factors. Any GES threshold on the 90th
   percentile of marine chlorophyll concentration can then be translated in
   maximum admissible `fully bioavailable' DIN and DIP concentrations, from
   which an iterative linear optimization method can compute river-specific
   minimal abatements of N and P loadings. The method has been applied to
   four major river groups, assuming either a conservative (8 mu g Chl L-1)
   or a more socially acceptable (15 mu g Chl L-1) GES chlorophyll
   concentration threshold. In the conservative case, maximum admissible
   winter concentrations for nutrients correspond to marine background
   values, whereas in the lenient case, they are close to values
   recommended by the WFD/MSFD. Both models suggest that to reach
   chlorophyll GES, strong reductions of DIN and DIP are required in the
   Eastern French and Belgian-Dutch river groups. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{175}},
Pages = {{72-79}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Urban-rural fringe is the frontier of urban expansion and the most
   dynamic area in urban region. Identifying the urban-rural fringe
   accurately is of great significance, as it helps to measure the extent
   of urbanization and its environmental effects from the urban-rural
   contrast perspective. However, traditional studies with spatial discrete
   data and threshold methods make it difficult to identify its boundary
   objectively and accurately. To solve this problem, a new approach was
   proposed in this study, integrating the spatial continuous data of
   impervious surface area (ISA) and the method of spatial continuous
   wavelet transform (SCWT). Taking Beijing City, one of the largest city
   in China, as a case, this study identified the boundary of urban-rural
   fringe, which extended mainly in the southwestern and northeastern
   direction, with the area increased by 18.75\% between 2009 and 2014. The
   accuracy of the identification result was verified by spatial
   differentiation characteristics of nighttime light and normalized
   difference vegetation index. Meanwhile, when compared with the
   subjective threshold method, it showed that SCWT could identify the
   fringe more accurately. And the ISA based identification result was more
   consistent with the actual spatial patterns of urban development in
   Beijing City than land use degree index based one, which showed the
   remotely sensed spatial continuous data performed more effectively well
   on identifying the urban-rural fringe. The proposed approach can
   identify the urban-rural fringe directly from remote sensing images,
   which is of great significance to quickly urbanization monitoring and
   thus sustainable urban planning and management.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{202}},
Pages = {{136-144}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies showed that continuous exposure to ammonia nitrogen
   (AN) contributed to regional losses of benthic invertebrate diversity in
   China. Yet, the overall ecological risk of AN to aquatic organisms in
   major riverine systems of China has not been appropriately studied. Our
   research then investigated temporal (seasonally/yearly) and spatial
   distributions of AN and un-ionized ammonia (NH3) in major Chinese river
   basins using historic data generated between 2007 and 2014, and
   developed risk assessment criteria. Our results showed that the highest
   average AN concentrations occurred during winter (0.82-2.76 mg/L) and
   the lowest during summer (036-0.78 mg/L). NH3 exhibited the opposite
   trend with the highest average concentrations mostly observed during
   spring (15.13-92.84 mu g/L) and the lowest concentrations mainly during
   winter (10.53-45.43 mu g/L). Both AN and NH3 concentrations steadily
   increased and reached maximum levels in 2008 (AN: 1.22 mg/L and 50.65 mu
   g/L), and then decreased. Temporal trends showed that the Yellow, Hai,
   and Huai river basins had the highest AN and NH3 concentrations.
   Subsequently, conventional (hazard quotients) and probabilistic (joint
   probability curves) methods were applied to assess the hazards and risks
   posed by AN and NH3. The results showed that the probability of
   exceeding the acute toxicity threshold for 5\% of species (exposed to AN
   or NH3) was less than 13.3\% and gradually decreased over time. To
   protect aquatic organisms, an acute criterion of 51.4 mu g NH3/L, and a
   chronic criterion of 1.14 mg AN/L at pH = 7.5, 20 degrees C were
   developed and are recommended for future risk assessment studies. (C)

Abstract = {{Given the increasing vulnerability of communities to the negative
   impacts of untreated wastewater, resource recovery (RR) systems provide
   a paradigm shift away from a traditional approach of waste separation
   and treatment towards a productive recovery of water, energy and
   nutrients. The aim of this research is to understand the relationships
   between factors that influence the adoption and sustainability of
   wastewater-based RR systems to inform technology implementation
   strategies. The study presents a theory-informed, community-influenced
   system dynamics (SD) model to provide decision-makers with an adaptable
   tool that simulates system-level responses to the strategies that are
   developed for the coastal town of Placencia, Belize. The modeling
   framework is informed by literature-based theories such as the theory of
   diffusion of innovations (TDI) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB).
   Various methods, including surveys, interviews, participatory
   observations, and a water constituents mass balance analysis are used to
   validate relationships and numerically populate the model. The SD model
   was evaluated with field data and simulated to identify strategies that
   will improve the adoption and sustainability of RR systems. Site
   demonstrations (marketing strategy) made a significant impact on the
   stock of adopted RR systems. The stock of sustained RR systems is driven
   by the sustainability rate (i.e. economic and environmental viability)
   which can be improved by more site demonstrations and tank options
   (technical strategy). These strategies, however, only contributed to
   incremental improvements in the system's sustainability performance.
   This study shows that changing community behaviors (i.e. reporting the
   correct number of users and reclaiming resources), represented by
   structural change in the SD model, is the more significant way to
   influence the sustainable management of the community's wastewater
   resources. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption/desorption of arsenic (As) at the sediment-water
   interface in lakes is the key to understanding whether As can enter the
   ecosystem and participate in material circulation. In this study, the
   concentrations of As(III), total arsenic {[}As(T)], sulfide, iron (Fe),
   and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in overlying water were observed
   after the initial sulfate (SO42-) concentrations were increased by four
   gradients in the presence and absence of microbial systems. The results
   indicate that increased SO42- concentrations in overlying water
   triggered As desorption from sediments. Approximately 10\% of the
   desorbed As was desorbed directly as arsenite or arsenate by competitive
   adsorption sites on the iron salt surface; 21\% was due to the reduction
   of iron (hydr)oxides; and 69\% was due to microbial activity, as
   compared with a system with no microbial activity. The intensity of
   microbial activity was controlled by the SO42- and DOC concentrations in
   the overlying water. In anaerobic systems, which had SO42- and DOC
   concentrations higher than 47 and 7 mg/L, respectively, microbial
   activity was promoted by SO42- and DOC; As(III) was desorbed under these
   indoor simulation conditions. When either the SO42- or DOC concentration
   was lower than its respective threshold of 47 or 7 mg/L, or when either
   of these indices was below its concentration limit, it was difficult for
   microorganisms to use SO42- and DOC to enhance their own activities.
   Therefore, conditions were insufficient for As desorption. The migration
   of As in lake sediments was dominated by microbial activity, which was
   co-limited by SO42- and DOC. The concentrations of SO42- and DOC in the
   overlying water are thus important for the prevention and control of As
   pollution in lakes. We recommend controlling SO42- and DOC
   concentrations as a method for controlling As inner-source pollution in
   lake water.}},

Abstract = {{Highly radioactive cesium-rich microparticles (CsMPs) were released from
   the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (FDNPP) to the surrounding

   contribute, which we call ``quantification of CsMPs{''} (QCP) and is
   based on autoradiography. Here, photostimulated luminescence (PSL) is
   linearly correlated to the radioactivity of various microparticles, with
   a regression coefficient of 0.0523 becquerel/PSL/h (Bq/PSL/h). In soil
   collected from Nagadoro, Fukushima, Japan, CsMPs were detected in soil
   sieved with a 114 mu m mesh. There was no overlap between the
   radioactivities of CsMPs and clay particles adsorbing Cs. Based on the
   distribution of radioactivity of CsMPs, the threshold radioactivity of
   CsMPs in the size fraction of <114 mu m was determined to be 0.06 Bq.
   Based on this method, the number and radioactivity fraction of CsMPs in
   four surface soils collected from the vicinity of the FDNPP were
   determined to be 48-318 particles per gram and 8.53-31.8\%,
   respectively. The QCP method is applicable to soils with a total
   radioactivity as high as , similar to 10(6) Bq/kg. This novel method is
   critically important and can be used to quantitatively understand the

Abstract = {{To improve the mode share of public transport and reduce the transition
   to private transport of passengers waiting at bus station, the mechanism
   of passengers' decision-making procedure and influence factors of the
   travel mode choice were analyzed. Some latent variables such as safety,
   comfort, convenience, flexibility and economy were selected to reflect
   the satisfaction degree of passengers on the service level of public
   transport. Taking Jinan City as an example, the questionnaire of
   passengers' travel choice behavior at bus station was designed and
   carried out. Based on the structure equation model (SEM), the
   relationship between the satisfaction degree and some latent variables
   such as safety and comfort was discussed. The SEM method analysis shows
   that, of the influence level of the latent variables to the service
   level of public transport, flexibility is the most significant variable
   affecting passenger's satisfaction degree followed by safety,
   convenience, comfort and economy. Travel mode choice model of passengers
   waiting at bus station was established with an integration approach of
   SEM and nested logit (NL) model. The SEM-NL integration model results
   reveal that gender, monthly income, purpose of the trip, travel
   distance, safety and convenience service level have a significant effect
   on the choice of the upper model (public transport or private
   transport). Passenger's age, vehicle ownership and bus ride frequency
   have great influence on the choice of the lower mode (ORB: original
   route bus; ARB: alternative route bus; Taxi; and Shared bike).
   Sensitivity analysis reveals that the transition probabilities from
   private transport to public transport can reach the highest point
   (respectively, 69.85\%, 68.84\% and 35.51\%) when safety service reaches
   level 4, convenience service reaches level 3, or comfort service reaches
   level 2, indicating that the safety level equal to 4, convenience level
   equal to 3 and comfort level equal to 2 are the key threshold to
   increase the public transport mode share. Some proposals such as
   ensuring good accessibility of public transport, shortening the transfer
   distance of different routes, creating a comfortable travel environment
   and integrating bus ticket system have been put forward for the
   sustainable development of public transport system.}},

Abstract = {{Industrialization and urbanization has rapidly advanced in China.
   Therefore, clarifying the relationship between industrial agglomeration
   and environmental pollution resolves questions if intensive or dispersed
   development should be adopted for the future Chinese industry or not. By
   distinguishing between specialized and diversified agglomeration, this
   paper adopts the threshold regression method to investigate the
   differentiated influence of industrial agglomeration stages on pollution
   emission reduction. This was based on panel data from 2003 to 2016 on
   285 prefecture-level cities in China. The result indicates that moderate
   degrees of industrial agglomeration and suitable agglomeration modes are
   conducive for the reduction of pollution emission. From a perspective of
   environmental protection, the development of diversified agglomeration
   is superior to that of specialized agglomeration. Specifically, a
   U-shaped relationship was found between specialized agglomeration and
   environmental pollution, suggesting that the former first mitigated and
   then worsened environmental pollution. This staged evolution of
   diversified agglomeration exerts a more-complex influence on
   environmental pollution. The following policy implications have been
   proposed: The currently implemented industrial growth pole strategy in
   China should fully utilize the self-purification effect of agglomeration
   to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction. Furthermore,
   differentiated agglomeration policies should be formulated in response
   to various growth poles according to different stages of industrial
   agglomeration. In addition, efforts should be made towards creating an
   interactive early warning mechanism for the spatial distribution of both
   economic activities and pollution.}},

   Two UAVs are used for remote sensing. The first UAV is a fixed wing
   aircraft with a high spatial resolution visible spectrum also known as
   RGB camera as a payload. The second UAV is a quadrotor UAV with an RGB
   camera interfaced to an on-board single board computer as the payload.
   LARS was carried out to acquire aerial high spatial resolution RGB
   images of different farms. Spectral-spatial classification of high
   spatial resolution RGB images for detection, delineation and counting of
   tree crowns in the image is presented. Supervised classification is
   carried out using extreme learning machine (ELM), a single hidden layer
   feed forward network neural network classifier. ELM was modelled for RGB
   values as input feature vectors and binary (tree and non-tree pixels)
   output class. Due to similarities in spectral intensities, some of the
   non-tree pixels were classified as tree pixels and in order to remove
   them, spatial classification was performed on the image. Spatial
   classification was carried out using thresholded geometrical property
   filtering techniques. Threshold values chosen for carrying out spatial
   classification were analysed to obtain optimal values. Finally in the
   delineation and counting, the connected tree crowns were segmented using
   Watershed algorithm performed on the image after marking individual tree
   crowns using Distance Transform method. Five representative UAV images
   captured at different altitudes with different crowns of banana plant,
   mango trees and coconut trees were used to demonstrate the performance
   of the proposed method. The performance was compared with the
   traditional KMeans spectral-spatial method of clustering. Results and
   comparison of performance parameters of KMeans spectral-spatial and ELM
   spectral-spatial classification methods are presented. Results indicate
   that ELM performed better than KMeans.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a rapid, cost-effective,
   non-invasive biodiversity monitoring tool which utilises DNA left behind
   in the environment by organisms for species detection. The method is
   used as a species-specific survey tool for rare or invasive species
   across a broad range of ecosystems. Recently, eDNA and metabarcoding
   have been combined to describe whole communities rather than focusing on
   single target species. However, whether metabarcoding is as sensitive as
   targeted approaches for rare species detection remains to be evaluated.
   The great crested newt Triturus cristatus is a flagship pond species of
   international conservation concern and the first UK species to be
   routinely monitored using eDNA. We evaluate whether eDNA metabarcoding
   has comparable sensitivity to targeted real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)
   for T.cristatus detection. Extracted eDNA samples (N=532) were screened
   for T.cristatus by qPCR and analysed for all vertebrate species using
   high-throughput sequencing technology. With qPCR and a detection
   threshold of 1 of 12 positive qPCR replicates, newts were detected in
   50\% of ponds. Detection decreased to 32\% when the threshold was
   increased to 4 of 12 positive qPCR replicates. With metabarcoding, newts
   were detected in 34\% of ponds without a detection threshold, and in
   28\% of ponds when a threshold (0.028\%) was applied. Therefore, qPCR
   provided greater detection than metabarcoding but metabarcoding
   detection with no threshold was equivalent to qPCR with a stringent
   detection threshold. The proportion of T.cristatus sequences in each
   sample was positively associated with the number of positive qPCR
   replicates (qPCR score) suggesting eDNA metabarcoding may be indicative
   of eDNA concentration. eDNA metabarcoding holds enormous potential for
   holistic biodiversity assessment and routine freshwater monitoring. We
   advocate this community approach to freshwater monitoring to guide
   management and conservation, whereby entire communities can be initially
   surveyed to best inform use of funding and time for species-specific
   surveys.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{212}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Earth Observation (EO) offers spatially and temporally unique data for
   generating information required under various environmental regulations
   for assessing the status of surface waters. These requirements, which
   are laid down in, for example, European Union directives and the Clean
   Water Act in the United States, share two core elements with respect to
   status assessments: 1) the status assessment is done using discrete
   classes, typically for water bodies, sub-areas or critical sites
   representative for certain area of interest, and 2) phytoplankton
   chlorophyll a (chl-a) is one of the main variables considered. We
   analysed the benefits of using chl-a concentrations derived from EO data
   for the status assessments specified in the EU Water Framework Directive
   (WFD). Our study focused especially on EO observations' ability to
   capture extreme and transient events (such as instances of cyanobacteria
   blooms) more frequently than the monitoring-station data conventionally
   employs. The accuracy of EO-based chl-a assessment was studied for, in
   all, 129 Finnish water bodies in the area of the Baltic Sea, in Northern
   Europe. Natural conditions in this coastal area particularly its
   multitude of small bays, numerous estuaries, and mosaic of islands
   impose exceptionally strict requirements for an EO instrument's spatial
   resolution. The analysis revealed that an instrument with a 300 m
   resolution, such as the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS)
   or Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI), can be used to estimate the
   water quality in 62\% of these water bodies. Processing of MERIS data
   into chl-a concentrations by means of a FUB inversion model demonstrated
   good accuracy relative to monitoring stations' measurements for the
   open-water season in 2003-2011. This extensive dataset showed a 23\%
   difference in modal values between EO- and station sampling -based chl-a
   concentrations. The bias in EO chl-a estimates was found to increase
   with low Secchi disk depth, elevated turbidity, and the presence of
   intensive phytoplankton blooms. The monitoring-station and EO data
   showed similar distributions of chl-a observations for a given day and
   location, a finding that supports the comprehensive use of EO-derived
   chl-a concentrations in assessment. For determination of a water body's
   status, the EO data required but also allowed for statistical analysis
   that differs from what has typically been utilised with sparse
   measurements from monitoring-station data. The geometric mean or the
   mode of the EO observations was found to represent the main bulk of the
   chl-a concentrations well statistically. In contrast, the arithmetic
   mean of EO observations yields chl-a concentrations that are roughly
   1.1-1.6 mu g/I higher and hence can lead to over-estimation in the
   associated status assessment. This paper also presents a new approach
   applicable for evaluating the validity of EO-based algorithms for any
   coastal water area requiring assessment. With this quality-grade (QG)
   method, the EO chl-a estimation accuracy is rated in terms of three
   grades, with water bodies taken as the evaluation units. For this, the
   method utilises statistical differences between EO and station-sampling
   chl-a concentrations and applies background information on optical
   properties obtained from measurements at routine-monitoring stations.
   The QG method showed the EO-based chl-a accuracy to suffice for
   assessing the status of 65\% of the coastal water bodies examined. At
   concentrations representing the threshold for the target of ``good
   status{''} under the WFD, the EO approach produced 0.
   6 mu g/I higher chl-a values than the stations' sampling did. The MERIS
   results point to clear benefits of using OLCI-based status assessment
   throughout the Sentinel-3 era.}},

   optimization method and application}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{614-620}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The optimization design of well spacing (WS) and aeration rate (AR) is
   crucial to the in situ aeration system operation in under long-term and
   high-efficiency conditions. This optimization design aims to transport
   additional air into landfills and to develop an improved oxygen
   environment for enhancing aerobic degradation. Given the specific pore
   structure distribution within landfills, providing sufficient oxygen in
   all waste bodies in field sites through gas wells is difficult. The
   design of well distribution also lacks adequate criteria. In this work,
   the multi-well optimization aeration method (MWOAM) was proposed to
   select the WS and AR from prediction results that consider gas transport
   properties by maximizing oxygen storage ratio (OSR) as the key objective
   threshold. This method was applied to the aeration restoration
   engineering in Jinkou landfill, which represents the first full-scale
   application of an aeration project in China, to optimize the operation
   scheme of the aeration system. Results of the gas concentration
   monitoring show that the trend of the OSR with aeration time based on
   the measurement agrees with the prediction. The oxygen and methane
   contents remain high and low within the landfill during the aeration
   process, respectively. Moreover, the temperature in the waste body did
   not exceed the upper limit value. These results suggested that the MWOAM
   is an effective means of supplying sufficient oxygen content across the
   landfill body and extend the aeration system operation for the long
   term. Therefore, this work provides reliable evidence to support the
   design and operation management of the aeration systems in full-scale
   landfills. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Processing data that originates from different sources (such as

   Additionally, the application of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), a
   set of Business Intelligence (BI) methodologies and practices for
   multidimensional data analysis, can be an invaluable tool for its

Abstract = {{1. Species monitoring using environmental DNA (eDNA) is a powerful new
   technique for natural resource scientists and the number of research
   groups employing eDNA detection is growing rapidly. However, current
   eDNA sampling technologies consist mainly of do-it-yourself solutions,
   and the lack of purpose-built sampling equipment is limiting the
   efficiency and standardization of eDNA studies.
   2. Here, we describe the first fully integrated sampling system (ANDe
   (TM)) designed by a team of molecular ecologists and engineers for
   high-throughput eDNA sample collection. It consists of a backpack
   portable pump that integrates sensor feedback, a pole extension with
   remote pump controller, custom-made filter housings in single-use
   packets for each sampling site and onboard sample storage. The system is
   optimized for sampling speed and replicability, while minimizing risk of
   contamination.
   3. We present an example pilot study designed to identify optimal ANDe
   (TM) system parameter values (i.e. pump pressure, flow rate, filter pore
   size, sample volume) in a new sampling environment. We identified a peak
   in filtration efficiency at a flow rate threshold of 1.0 L/m, and found
   that 5 mu m filters captured significantly more target eDNA than 1 mu m
   filters. Results also suggest that high filtration pressures may reduce
   eDNA retention, which implies that pressure should be standardized to
   avoid biasing detection data.
   4. Similar to the technological evolution of backpack electrofishers,
   eDNA sampling technology is in the process of transitioning from a
   nascent phase to professionally engineered research tools. Such
   innovations will be essential as eDNA monitoring becomes one of the
   industry standard methods used for species detection and management.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{897-909}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Positive density dependence (i.e., Allee effects) can create a threshold
   of population states below which extinction of the population occurs.
   The existence of this threshold, which can often be a complex,
   multi-dimensional surface, rather than a single point, is of particular
   importance in degraded populations for which there is a desire for
   successful restoration. Here, we incorporated positive density
   dependence into a closed, size- and age-structured integral projection
   model parameterized with empirical data from an eastern oyster,
   Crassostrea virginica, population in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA.
   To understand the properties of the threshold surface, and implications
   for restoration, we introduced a general method based on a linearization
   of the threshold surface at its unique, unstable equilibrium. We
   estimated the number of oysters of a particular age (i.e., stock
   enhancement), or the surface area of dead shell substrate required
   (i.e., habitat enhancement) to move a population from an extinction
   trajectory to a persistence trajectory. The location of the threshold
   surface was strongly affected by changes in the amount of local larval
   retention. Traditional stock enhancement with oysters <1 yr old (i.e.,
   spat) required three times as many oysters relative to stock enhancement
   with oysters between ages 3 and 7yr old, while the success of habitat
   enhancement depended upon the initial size distribution of the
   population. The methodology described here demonstrates the importance
   of considering positive density dependence in oyster populations, and
   also provides insights into effective management and restoration
   strategies when dealing with a high dimensional threshold separating
   extinction and persistence.}},

Abstract = {{River restoration is widely applied, although its effects are poorly
   understood, and degraded habitats might be difficult to improve.
   Moreover, there is a lack of monitoring as well as few systematic
   comparisons of restoration methods. This study presents results of a
   4-year monitoring on River Inn (southern Germany) investigating
   restoration by gravel or sand addition or embankment removal. The
   results were compared with reference sites that represent the

   vegetation types based on aerial photographs, whereas at a smaller
   scale, we undertook vegetation surveys and evaluated species
   composition, growth, and life form, as well as the proportion of the
   target vegetation. After 4years, the data indicated a negative
   resilience of the vegetation back to the state prior to restoration. The
   structural analysis revealed an extensive spread of reed at expense of
   bare soil. Thus, the species composition largely regressed to the
   pre-restoration conditions, and neither annuals nor other pioneer
   species showed a long-term benefit of river restoration. There were
   differences among the three restoration treatments after 2years, but no
   longer after 4years. However, the river restoration had three positive
   outcomes: (a) There was a temporary benefit for pioneer vegetation that
   most likely replenished the seed bank of the respective species, (b) the
   valuable reed communities showed resilience, and (c) the measures
   allowed some practical learning as expected for adaptive restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are a diverse and essential biota of

   late-seral habitat. We examined how the spatial ecology of this biota,
   particularly distance-decay and species-area relationships, could better
   inform habitat thresholds for EMF conservation planning.
   Location: Southeast Vancouver Island near Victoria, British Columbia,
   Canada.
   Methods: Using a stratified sampling design, 11 plots (0.15ha in size)
   were established at 0.05-17.5km apart across 2,800ha of mesic old-growth
   Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii and Tsuga heterophylla forests. EMF
   communities were compiled through molecular analysis of root tips and
   sporocarps.
   Results: The EMF community was comprised of many Cortinarius, Piloderma,
   Russula and Tricholoma species typical of mesotrophic habitat. A total
   of 238 EMF species were observed, of which 86 species were detected only
   once. The ratio of average species richness per plot (84 taxa) to total
   richness was low at 0.35, and inherent stochasticity of the EMF
   community was estimated to be 31\% community dissimilarity for species
   incidence. Distance decay of EMF communities was nonlinear, with an
   estimated slope break at 2.6km, followed by a largely unchanging trend
   in -diversity. Accumulated species-area curves were fitted best by the
   cumulative Weibull sigmoid model, and the asymptote (367 species) at
   approx. 50ha was consistent with nonparametric estimates of -diversity
   (342-362 spp.).
   Main conclusions: Old-growth forests host an impressive amount of EMF
   diversity, and many of the Ramaria, Inocybe and Russula species are
   likely to be endemic to the Pacific Northwest. Both niche- and
   neutral-based processes influenced EMF community composition, resulting
   in a minimum threshold of 50ha (1.8\% of the sample area) for capturing
   -diversity. These spatial patterns will help design and evaluate
   conservation efforts, such as retention forestry, to sustain fully
   diverse EMF communities over managed landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Indicators of wildlife health are important elements of a comprehensive
   approach for assessing and monitoring trends of methyl mercury (MeHg)
   contamination in the environment. River otters (Lontra canadensis) have
   been used as a model species for toxicological studies on the effects of
   MeHg bioaccumulation due to their position as an apex predator in
   aquatic systems and sensitivity to environmental disturbance. Although
   laboratory studies suggest that sublethal MeHg exposure may have
   detrimental effects on wildlife, they are limited in their ability to
   reflect real world exposure and forecast population level effects. Few
   studies have identified the threshold at which MeHg exposure results in
   a population-level effect for wild populations of river otters in marine
   or freshwater systems. We used a series of data sets collected over a
   7-year period for river otter populations in central British Columbia,
   Canada, to assess mercury concentrations (river otter fur) and
   measurements of population status and health relative to a lake with an
   inactive and reclamated mercury mine along its shoreline (Pinchi Lake).
   We used a combination of remote cameras, marked individuals, hair
   snares, and scat counts/inventories to collect measurements of
   population status and health including: activity levels, population
   estimates, sex ratios, group sizes, litter sizes, behaviour, stress
   hormones, diet, and habitat quality. We found that mercury
   concentrations in river otter inhabiting Pinchi Lake were significantly
   higher than all other lakes in the study, and were also high relative to
   other areas in Canada and the United States. We did not, however, detect
   significant differences between the two lakes in many of the population
   parameters measured. We discuss the knowledge gaps and challenges of
   identifying the effects of MeHg for wild populations of mammals,
   determining sensitive and appropriate methods for measuring these
   effects, and the implications of our results for monitoring the impacts
   of natural resources activities. Detailed studies on population effects
   across a range of exposure and background conditions are required to
   address these data deficiencies. Typically, river otters are not
   included as monitoring species in environmental assessments even though
   their value as an indicator of anthropogenic contaminants has clearly
   been documented. We encourage inclusion of river otters in environmental
   assessments pre-, during-, and post-industrial activities as a measure
   of pollutant exposure and bioavailability as well as a critical first
   step in addressing knowledge gaps associated with contaminants and its
   effects on populations.}},

Abstract = {{Lake ecosystems are sensitive recorders of environmental changes that
   provide continuous archives at annual to decadal resolution over
   thousands of years. The systematic investigation of land use changes and
   emission of pollutants archived in Holocene lake sediments as well as
   the reconstruction of contamination, background conditions, and
   sensitivity of lake systems offer an ideal opportunity to study
   environmental dynamics and consequences of anthropogenic impact that
   increasingly pose risks to human well-being. This paper discusses the
   use of sediment and other lines of evidence in providing a record of
   historical and current contamination in lake ecosystems. We present a
   novel approach to investigate impacts from human activities using
   chemical analytical, bioanalytical, ecological, paleolimnological,
   paleoecotoxicological, archeological as well as modeling techniques.
   This multi-time slice weight-of-evidence (WOE) approach will generate
   knowledge on conditions prior to anthropogenic influence and provide
   knowledge to (i) create a better understanding of the effects of
   anthropogenic disturbances on biodiversity, (ii) assess water quality by
   using quantitative data on historical pollution and persistence of
   pollutants archived over thousands of years in sediments, and (iii)
   define environmental threshold values using modeling methods. This
   techniquemay be applied in order to gain insights into reference
   conditions of surface and ground waters in catchments with a long

Abstract = {{China is one of the fastest-growing economies of the late 20th and early
   21st centuries, and heavy metal emissions have increased in parallel
   with rapid industrialization and urbanization. Over the last decade,
   several studies of geochemical records from peat have reconstructed
   changes in atmospheric metal pollution in China. We review the peat
   records that detail the history of atmospheric metal pollution over the
   last two centuries in NE China. The ecological risk (ER) of accumulated
   metals and their potential eco-toxicological effects, through threshold
   and probable effect concentrations (TEC and PEC), are also evaluated.
   Peat records of metals show an increase of pollution loads in the
   environment over the pre-industrial level during the past two centuries,
   with an unprecedented increase in China over the last 60 years. There is
   generally good agreement between geochemical peat records from NE China
   and others records elsewhere in China. However, some discrepancies are
   observed especially with Hg records from lake sediments. These
   discrepancies could be explained by several factors, including
   post-depositional processes or uncertainties arising from dating
   methods. The ecological risk of heavy metals is found to be relatively
   weak in the remote and high-altitude environment in NE China. Although,
   most metals are under the TEC, Pb concentrations usually surpass it and
   are getting close to the PEC which indicates increasing ecological
   risks. Some areas of improvement have been highlighted such as the need
   for more long-term studies on atmospheric metals and a greater number of
   Pb isotopes records to better capture the long history of human activity
   and the spatial variability in metal deposition of the region. (c) 2018

Abstract = {{Developing novel methods for the removal of heavy-metal ions from
   wastewater with low costs, special selectivity and high efficiency is
   quite important in water restoration and comprehensive ecological
   improvement. In this work, a nanopore-based strategy was suggested and
   related segregation apparatus was built to separate multiple heavy-metal
   ions in water by selective complexation. The results indicated that the
   prioritization of the selecting order for the complexing agent
   (thiacalix{[}4]arene-p-tetrasulfonate (TCAS)) to heavy-metal ions was
   Cu(II) > Cd(II) > Pb(II) > Ba(II). Meanwhile, higher driven voltage
   corresponded to a faster separation speed, while it could cause the
   decomposition of complexed heavy-metal ions when excessed the threshold.
   On the other hand, pH value would affect the hydrolysis of heavy-metal
   ions, the complexation of the calixarene to the heavy-metal ions and the
   speed of the electroosmotic flow. In our experiments, the maximum
   separation efficiency was achieved when the driven voltage was 1.5 V and
   the pH value was 5.0, corresponding to the best separation rate of
   94.8\%, 95.2\%, 92.8\%, 93.6\%, for Cu(II), Cd(II), Pb(II) and Ba(II),

Abstract = {{Global warming and rapid urbanization in China have caused a series of
   ecological problems. One consequence has involved the degradation of
   lake water environments. Lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs)
   significantly shape water ecological environments and are highly
   correlated with the watershed ecosystem features and biodiversity
   levels. Analysing and predicting spatiotemporal changes in LSWT and
   exploring the corresponding impacts on water quality is essential for
   controlling and improving the ecological water environment of
   watersheds. In this study, Dianchi Lake was examined through an analysis
   of 54 water quality indicators from 10 water quality monitoring sites
   from 2005 to 2016. Support vector regression (SVR), Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA) and Back Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BPANN)
   methods were applied to form a hybrid forecasting model. A geospatial
   analysis was conducted to observe historical LSWTs and water quality
   changes for Dianchi Lake from 2005 to 2016. Based on the constructed
   model, LSWTs and changes in water quality were simulated for 2017 to
   2020. The relationship between LSWTs and water quality thresholds was
   studied. The results show limited errors and highly generalized levels
   of predictive performance. In addition, a spatial visualization analysis
   shows that from 2005 to 2020, the chlorophyll-a (Chia), chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) diffused from north to south and
   that ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP) levels are
   increases in the northern part of Dianchi Lake, where the LSWT levels
   exceed 17 degrees C. The LSWT threshold is 17.6-18.53 degrees C, which
   falls within the threshold for nutritional water quality, but COD and TN
   levels fall below V dass water quality standards. Transparency (Trans),
   COD, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and Chla levels present a close
   relationship with LSWT, and LSWTs are found to fundamentally affect lake

Abstract = {{Sustainability science (SS), rooted in multiple disciplines, has been
   developing rapidly during the last two decades and become a
   well-recognized new field of study. However, the ``identity{''} of SS

   the key characteristics of SS by revisiting the question raised by the
   leading sustainability scientist, Robert Kates (2011): ``What kind of a
   science is sustainability science?{''} Specifically, we reviewed the
   literature in SS, and developed a synthesis of definitions and core
   research questions of SS, using multiple methods including change-point
   detection, word cloud visualization, and content and thematic analyses.
   Our study has produced several main findings: (1) the development of SS
   exhibited an S-shaped growth pattern, with an exponential growth phase
   through to 2012, and a asymptotic development phase afterwards; (2) ten
   key elements from the existing definitions of SS were identified, of
   which understanding ``human-environment interactions{''} and
   ``use-inspired{''} were most prominent; and (3) sixteen core questions
   in SS were derived from the literature. We further proposed an
   eight-theme framework of SS to help understand how the sixteen questions
   are related to each other. We argue that SS is coming of age, but more
   integrative and concerted efforts are still needed to further
   consolidate its identity by developing a coherent and rigorous

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Conventional environmental-economic power dispatch methods constrain the
   total amount of emissions of power plants, and they succeed in reducing
   emissions from the power sector. However, they fail to address the
   mismatch between emission reductions and the resulting changes in
   regional air quality. This paper proposes an ecology- and
   security-constrained unit commitment (Eco-SCUC) model considering the
   differentiated impacts of generation-associated emissions on regional
   air quality. A Gaussian puff dispersion model is applied to capture the
   temporal-spatial transport of air pollutants. Additionally, an air
   pollutant intensity (API) index is defined for assessing the impacts of
   emissions on the air quality in regions with differentiated atmospheric
   environmental capacities. Then the API constraints are formulated based
   on air quality forecast and included in SCUC model. Moreover, the
   stochastic optimization is employed to accommodate wind power
   uncertainty, and the Benders decomposition technique is used to solve
   the formulated mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. Case
   studies demonstrate that the Eco-SCUC can cost-effectively improve air
   quality for densely-populated regions via shifting generation among
   units and can significantly reduce the person-hours exposed to severe
   air pollution. Furthermore, the benefits of wind power for air quality

   Generating Quantitative Risk Estimates for Chemicals}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Human health assessments synthesize human, animal, and
   mechanistic data to produce toxicity values that are key inputs to
   risk-based decision making. Traditional assessments are data-, time-,
   and resource-intensive, and they cannot be developed for most
   environmental chemicals owing to a lack of appropriate data.
   OBJECTIVES: As recommended by the National Research Council, we propose
   a solution for predicting toxicity values for data-poor chemicals
   through development of quantitative structure-activity relationship
   (QSAR) models.
   METHODS: We used a comprehensive database of chemicals with existing
   regulatory toxicity values from U.S. federal and state agencies to
   develop quantitative QSAR models. We compared QSAR-based model
   predictions to those based on high-throughput screening (HTS) assays.
   RESULTS: QSAR models for noncancer threshold-based values and cancer
   slope factors had cross-validation-based Q(2) of 0.25-0.45, mean model
   errors of 0.70-1.11 log(10) units, and applicability domains covering >
   80\% of environmental chemicals. Toxicity values predicted from QSAR
   models developed in this study were more accurate and precise than those
   based on HTS assays or mean-based predictions. A publicly accessible web
   interface to make predictions for any chemical of interest is available
   at http://toxvalue. org.
   CONCLUSIONS: An in silico tool that can predict toxicity values with an
   uncertainty of an order of magnitude or less can be used to quickly and
   quantitatively assess risks of environmental chemicals when traditional
   toxicity data or human health assessments are unavailable. This tool can
   fill a critical gap in the risk assessment and management of data-poor
   chemicals.}},

Title = {{Determination of trigger levels for groundwater quality in landfills
   located in historically human-impacted areas}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{400-406}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Landfills are one of the most recurrent sources of groundwater
   contamination worldwide. In order to limit their impacts on groundwater
   resources, current environmental regulations impose the adoption of
   proper measures for the protection of groundwater quality. For instance,
   in the EU member countries, the calculation of trigger levels for
   identifying significant adverse environmental effects on groundwater
   generated by landfills is required by the Landfill Directive 99/31/EC.
   Although the derivation of trigger levels could be relatively easy when
   groundwater quality data prior to the construction of a landfill are
   available, it becomes challenging when these data are missing and
   landfills are located in areas that are already impacted by historical
   contamination.
   This work presents a methodology for calculating trigger levels for
   groundwater quality in landfills located in areas where historical
   contaminations have deteriorated groundwater quality prior to their
   construction. This method is based on multivariate statistical analysis
   and involves 4 steps: (a) implementation of the conceptual model, (b)
   landfill monitoring data collection, (c) hydrochemical data clustering
   and (d) calculation of the trigger levels.
   The proposed methodology was applied on a case study in northern Italy,
   where a currently used lined landfill is located downstream of an old
   unlined landfill and others old unmapped waste deposits. The developed
   conceptual model stated that groundwater quality deterioration observed
   downstream of the lined landfill is due to a degrading leachate plume
   fed by the upgradient unlined landfill. The methodology led to the
   determination of two trigger levels for COD and NH4-N, the former for a
   zone representing the background hydrochemistry (28 and 9 mg/L for COD
   and NH4-N, respectively), the latter for the zone impacted by the
   degrading leachate plume from the upgradient unlined landfill (89 and 83
   mg/L for COD and NH4-N, respectively). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Aim: Aphyllophoroid fungi are associated with plants, either using
   plants as a resource (as parasites or decomposers) or as symbionts (as
   mycorrhizal partners). In spite of their strong association with plants,
   it is unknown how much plant distributions determine their
   biogeographical patterns compared with environmental factors such as
   climate and human land use. In this study, our aims are to (1) describe
   the spatial diversity patterns of aphyllophoroid fungi in Europe and (2)
   identify the factors shaping these patterns.
   Location: Europe, as well as the adjacent Subarctic to Arctic islands
   (Greenland, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Svalbard), Palestine and the
   south-east coast of the Caspian Sea.
   Methods: We compiled a dataset consisting of 14,030 fruitbody
   occurrences of 1,491 aphyllophoroid fungal species from 39 geographical
   areas (17 countries) belonging to eight biogeographical regions. We
   assessed the differences in fungal species richness and overall
   diversity and its nestedness and turnover components across
   biogeographical regions of Europe, as well as between southern and
   northern Europe (based on geographical latitude of 50 degrees as
   threshold). We used cluster and ordination analyses to classify the
   European aphyllophoroid communities biogeographically and evaluated the
   importance of climate, host-tree species, topography and human land-use
   intensity in explaining biogeographical variation.
   Results: The importance of biogeographical regions in determining
   European aphyllophoroid fungal communities varies for different
   diversity components. Species richness and nestedness are best explained
   by plant-based biogeographical regions, whereas overall beta diversity
   and species turnover are driven mostly by variation in climate, and
   nestedness mostly by tree species occupancy. Beta-diversity patterns of
   aphyllophoroid fungi do not differ between southern and northern Europe.
   Main conclusions: At the continental scale, aphyllophoroid fungi are
   less shaped by historical legacies than vascular plant and animal
   communities, and trends of overall beta diversity in southern and
   northern Europe are similar to patterns found for bryophytes.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem regime shifts are abrupt changes from one dynamical state to
   another, such as the shift from a clear-water state to an algal bloom
   state in lakes. These transitions are hard to forecast but theory
   suggests that early warning indicators can predict impending regime
   shifts that may allow for management intervention to prevent or mitigate
   an unwanted change. The efficacy of early warning indicators has been
   demonstrated in modeling and laboratory experiments, but rarely in the
   field, where environmental drivers are numerous and interacting. It is
   unclear if early warning indicators are observable or timely enough to
   allow for intervention under these conditions. We performed six
   whole-lake experimental nutrient additions to test the utility of early
   warning indicators for predicting the regime shift from a clear-water
   state to a cyanobacteria-dominated state. The lakes were monitored for
   increases in resilience indicators including rises in standard deviation
   and autocorrelation of algal pigments and dissolved oxygen saturation. A
   statistical method, quickest detection, determined when resilience
   indicators in manipulated lakes deviated substantially from those in a
   reference ecosystem. Blooms occurred in five of the six lake-years.
   Although there was substantial variability in bloom size and timing, at
   least one indicator foreshadowed the peak chlorophyll a concentration in
   all instances. Early warnings occurred 1-57 d prior to a bloom, which in
   some instances, may allow managers to notify the public or intervene to
   prevent blooms. The resilience indicators generally identified changes
   in resilience over time within a lake and also ranked large differences
   in resilience among lakes. Our findings suggest that resilience
   indicators can be useful for classifying ecosystems on a landscape and
   across time with respect to proximity to a critical threshold.}},

Abstract = {{Solar energy utilization will play an increasingly important role in
   sustainable urban development because it will help motivate low-carbon
   development. This study proposed a framework that calculates the solar
   irradiance on roofs and facades of city-scale buildings, as well as the
   potential reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions that can be
   derived from solar energy utilization. This framework consolidates data
   acquired using 3D remote sensing techniques (e.g., light detection and
   ranging (LiDAR) data and digital photogrammetry) with existing 3D
   building vector models from urban planning and building design. To
   further the economical use of solar energy, the framework provides a new
   strategy based on three aspects (threshold, structure, and orientation),
   for a more realistic analysis of the available area of roofs and
   facades, by combining street view images and point clouds. Nanjing,
   China, was selected as a study area for validating and analyzing the
   proposed framework. The experimental area covers approximately 30 km(2)
   and 5216 buildings. The reliability of the proposed method was validated
   by comparing the results with the computation modules of mainstream
   commercial programs and previous international studies. The following
   conclusions were drawn from the experimental area. (1) Annual solar
   energy on the roofs of all buildings was 9647.89 GWh, corresponding to a
   PV yield of 1447.18 GWh, which equates to reductions of 584.66 kt in
   standard coal consumption and 1261.94 kt in CO2 emissions. The annual
   solar energy on the facades was 5364.63 GWh, corresponding to a PV yield
   of 804.69 GWh, which equates to reductions of 325.10 kt in standard coal
   consumption and 701.69 kt in CO2 emissions. (2) Based on the calculated
   potential solar energy utilization of the building envelopes, it was
   shown that the utilization of solar radiation on roofs and facades would
   promote low-carbon urban development. The utilization of solar energy on
   the facades of high buildings will contribute to the supply of energy
   for these buildings and help balance their energy consumption. (3) As
   the solar incidence angle changes over time, the reductions in energy
   consumption and CO2 emissions related to PV power generation are maximal
   in summer for building roofs, whereas no significant seasonal
   differences were observed for facades. (4) Incorporating the available
   area translates the utilization of solar energy and potential CO2
   reductions from theory to practical application by reducing inefficient
   and invalid areas. The percentages of available area of roof and facade
   were estimated at 47\% and 16\% by comprehensive calculations
   considering three aspects (threshold, structure, and orientation). The
   corresponding potential of solar energy on the roofs and facades in the
   validation area B are 167.18 GWh and 53.63 GWh, respectively, compared
   to the original theoretic values of 316.97 GWh and 237.98 GWh.}},

   younger adults in hominid fossil remains, indicating considerably high
   adult mortality in australopithecines, early Homo, and Neanderthals. It
   is not clear to date why only human ancestors among all hominoid species
   could survive in these harsh environments. In this paper, we explore the
   possibility that hominids had shorter interbirth intervals to enhance
   fertility than the extant apes. To infer interbirth intervals in fossil
   hominids, we introduce the notion of the critical interbirth interval,
   or the threshold length of birth spacing above which a population is
   expected to go to extinction. We develop a new method to obtain the
   critical interbirth intervals of hominids based on the observed ratios
   of older adults to all adults in fossil samples. Our analysis suggests
   that the critical interbirth intervals of australopithecines, early
   Homo, and Neanderthals are significantly shorter than the observed
   interbirth intervals of extant great apes. We also discuss possible
   factors that may have caused the evolutionary divergence of hominid life
   history traits from those of great apes.}},

Title = {{A Novel Method for the Development of Environmental Public Health
   Indicators and Benchmark Dose Estimation Using a Health-Based End Point
   for Chlorpyrifos}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Organophosphorus (OP) compounds are the most widely used
   group of insecticides in the world. Risk assessments for these chemicals
   have focused primarily on 10\% inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in the
   brain as the critical metric of effect. Aside from cholinergic effects
   resulting from acute exposure, many studies suggest a linkage between
   cognitive deficits and long-term OP exposure.
   OBJECTIVE: In this proof-of-concept study, we focused on one of the most
   widely used OP insecticides in the world, chlorpyrifos (CPF), and
   utilized an existing physiologically based phammcokinetic (PBPK) model
   and a novel phammcodynamic (PD) dose response model to develop a point
   of departure benchmark dose estimate for cognitive deficits following
   long-term, low-dose exposure to this chemical in rodents.
   METHODS: Utilizing a validated PBPK/PD model for CPF, we generated a
   database of predicted biomarkers of exposure and internal dose metrics
   in both rat and human. Using simulated peak brain CPF concentrations, we
   developed a dose response model to predict CPF-induced spatial memory
   deficits and correlated these changes to relevant biomarkers of exposure
   to derive a benchmark dose specific to `neurobehavioral changes. We
   extended these cognitive deficit predictions to humans and simulated
   corresponding exposures using a model parameterized for humans.
   RESULTS: Results from this study indicate that the human-equivalent
   benchmark dose (BMD) based on a 15\% cognitive deficit as an end point
   is lower than that using the present threshold for 10\% brain AChE
   inhibition. This predicted human-equivalent subchronic BMD threshold
   compares to occupational exposure levels determined from biomarkers of
   exposure and corresponds to similar exposure conditions where deficits
   in cognition are observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative PD models based on neurobehavioral testing in
   animals offer an important addition to the methodologies used for
   establishing useful environmental public health indicators and BMDs, and
   predictions from such models could help inform the human health risk
   assessment for chlorpyrifos.}},

Abstract = {{Context. Trapping of small vertebrates during their active hot summer
   periods is vital for conservation and impact assessment studies. Animal
   Ethics Committees (AECs) protect wildlife by enforcing arbitrary but
   restrictive temperature limits for trapping.
   Aims. Empirical data were gathered on the temperatures reached in
   different trap configurations to inform pragmatic ethical guidelines.
   Methods. Temperature was measured inside small vertebrate traps at two
   Australian arid zone sites to generate data on the thermal consequences
   of: (1) trap design and external shading; (2) provision of protective
   refuge substrates; and (3) timing of trap clearing.
   Key results. Shading and increased trap depth significantly reduced
   temperatures within pitfall traps. A conservative stressful upper
   temperature limit of 36 degrees C was never exceeded inside deep,
   shaded, narrow pitfall traps at one study site and only between 1100 and
   1300 hours on 3 days at the hotter site, despite ambient temperatures
   reaching over 42 degrees C. By contrast, potentially lethal upper
   temperatures were reached in wider, shallower bucket pit traps on most
   days at both sites, even when optimal shading and refuge substrates were
   employed. Deployment of surface traps under vegetation and with
   additional shading significantly reduced maximum temperatures
   experienced. Temperatures inside shaded Elliott and funnel traps
   generally tracked ambient air temperatures and thus typically exceeded
   conservative threshold temperatures between 0700 and 1900 hours when
   ambient temperatures exceeded 36 degrees C.
   Conclusions. Temperatures experienced in optimal deep, shaded traps when
   ambient temperatures exceeded 40 degrees C were 31 degrees C lower than
   surface temperatures and similar to temperatures recorded at 20 cm below
   the soil surface, where many species would typically take refuge at
   these times.
   Implications. Data suggest that deep (60 cm), narrow pitfall traps with
   elevated lids for shade and shelter substrate inside should enable
   trapping to be conducted safely in the study region during summer
   (December to February). This is even the case in extremely hot weather,
   as long as trapped animals are removed within 4 h of sunrise.
   Ecophysiological studies of thermal tolerance within optimum trap
   arrangements revealed by the present study will allow field ecologists
   and AECs to develop informed site-specific trapping protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Air pollutant measurement and respiratory inflammatory tests were
   conducted at a junior secondary school in Xi'an, Northwestern China.
   Hazardous substances including particulate matters (PMs), black carbon
   (BC) and particle-bounded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were
   quantified both indoors and outdoors of the school. Source
   characterization with organic tracers and particle-size distribution
   demonstrated that the school's air was mostly polluted by combustion
   emissions from the surrounding environment. The evaluation of health
   assessment related to air quality was conducted by two methods,
   including potential risk estimation of air pollutants and direct
   respiratory inflammatory test. The incremental lifetime cancer risks
   associated with PAHs were estimated and were 1.62 x 10(-6) and 2.34 x
   10(-6), respectively, for indoor and outdoor fine PMs. Both the values
   exceeded the threshold value of 1 x 10(-6), demonstrating that the
   carcinogenic PAHs are a health threat to the students. Respiratory
   inflammatory responses of 50 students who studied in the sample
   classroom were examined with a fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)
   test, with the aid of health questionnaires. The average FeNO
   concentration was 17.4 +/- 8.5 ppb, which was slightly lower than the
   recommended level of 20 ppb established by the American Thoracic Society
   for children. However, a wide distribution and 6\% of the values were >
   35 ppb, suggesting that the potentials were still high for eosinophilic
   inflammation and responsiveness to corticosteroids. A preliminary
   interpretation of the relationship between air toxins and respiratory
   inflammatory response demonstrated the high exposure cancer risks and
   inflammatory responses of the students to PMs in the city.}},

Abstract = {{Cadmium (Cd) is an environmental toxicant with high rates of soil-plant
   transfer. It is essential to establish an accurate soil threshold for
   the implementation of soil management practices. This study takes root
   vegetable as an example to derive soil thresholds for Cd based on the
   food quality standard as well as health risk assessment using species
   sensitivity distribution (SSD). A soil type-specific bioconcentration
   factor (BCF, ratio of Cd concentration in plant to that in soil)
   generated from soil with a proper Cd concentration gradient was
   calculated and applied in the derivation of soil thresholds instead of a
   generic BCF value to minimize the uncertainty. The sensitivity
   variations of twelve root vegetable cultivars for accumulating soil Cd
   and the empirical soil-plant transfer model were investigated and
   developed in greenhouse experiments. After normalization, the hazardous
   concentrations from the fifth percentile of the distribution based on
   added Cd (HC5(add)) were calculated from the SSD curves fitted by Burr
   Type III distribution. The derived soil thresholds were presented as
   continuous or scenario criteria depending on the combination of soil pH
   and organic carbon content. The soil thresholds based on food quality
   standard were on average 0.7-fold of those based on health risk
   assessment, and were further validated to be reliable using independent
   data from field survey and published articles. The results suggested
   that deriving soil thresholds for Cd using SSD method is robust and also
   applicable to other crops as well as other trace elements that have the
   potential to cause health risk issues. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In a mountain environment, the transport of coarse material is a key
   factor for many fields such as geomorphology, ecology, hazard
   assessment, and reservoir management. Despite this, there have been only
   a few field investigations of bedload, in particular using multiple
   monitoring methods. In this sense, attention has frequently focused on
   the effects of ``high magnitude/low frequency floods{''} rather than on
   ``ordinary events{''}. This study aims to analyze the sediment dynamics
   triggered by three high-frequency floods (recurrence interval ``RI{''}
   between 1.1 and 1.7 yr) that occurred in the Rio Cordon basin during
   2014. The flood events were investigated in terms of both sediment
   mobility and bedload magnitude. The Rio Cordon is an Alpine basin
   located in northeastern Italy. The catchment has a surface area of 5
   km(2), ranging between 1763 and 2763 m above sea level. The Rio Cordon
   flows on an armored streambed layer, with a stable step-pool
   configuration and large boulders. Since 1986, the basin has been
   equipped with a permanent station to continuously monitor water
   discharge and sediment flux. To investigate sediment mobility, 250
   PIT-tags were installed in the streambed in 2012. The 2014 floods showed
   a clear difference in terms of tracer displacement. The near-bankfull
   events showed equal mobility conditions, with mean travel distance one
   order of magnitude higher than the below-bankfull event. Furthermore,
   only the near-bankfull events transported coarse material to the
   monitoring station. Both events had a peak discharge up to 2.06 m(3)
   s(-1), but the bedload transport rates differed by more than one order
   of magnitude, proving that under the current supply-limited condition,
   the bedload appears more related to the sediment supply than to the
   magnitude of the hydrological features. In this sense, the results
   demonstrated that near-bankfull events can mobilize large amounts of
   material for long distances, and that floods of apparently similar
   magnitude may lead to different sediment dynamics, depending on the type
   and amount of sediment supply. (C) 2017 International Research and

Abstract = {{The Land Surface Temperature (LST) of a park is lower than the

   The LST and Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) of 18 different sized parks in

Abstract = {{Resource selection functions (RSFs) are tremendously valuable for
   ecologists and resource managers because they quantify spatial patterns
   in resource utilization by wildlife, thereby facilitating identification
   of critical habitat areas and characterizing specific habitat features
   that are selected or avoided. RSFs discriminate between known-use
   resource units (e.g., telemetry locations) and available (or randomly
   selected) resource units based on an array of environmental features,
   and in their standard form are performed using logistic regression. As
   generalized linear models, standard RSFs have some notable limitations,
   such as difficulties in accommodating nonlinear (e.g., humped or
   threshold) relationships and complex interactions. Increasingly,
   ecologists are using flexible machine-learning methods (e.g., random
   forests, neural networks) to overcome these limitations. Herein, we
   investigate the seasonal resource selection patterns of mule deer
   (Odocoileus hemionus) by comparing a logistic regression framework with
   random forest (RF), a popular machine-learning algorithm. Random forest
   (RF) models detected nonlinear relationships (e.g., optimal ranges for
   slope and elevation) and complex interactions which would have been very
   challenging to discover and characterize using standard model-based
   approaches. Compared with standard RSF models, RF models exhibited
   improved predictive skill, provided novel insights about resource
   selection patterns of mule deer, and, when projected across a relevant
   geographic space, manifested notable differences in predicted habitat
   suitability. We recommend that wildlife researchers harness the
   strengths of machine-learning tools like RF in addition to classical
   tools (e.g., mixed-effects logistic regression) for evaluating resource
   selection, especially in cases where extensive telemetry data sets are
   available.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is an assessment of metal pollution levels in
   Aegean Sea sediment. Sediment samples collected from 7 different
   locations (Yenikoy, Edremit, Ayvalik, Dikili, Aliaga, Hekimadasi, and
   Ildir) along the northern Mediterranean region of Turkey were
   investigated for 11 elements (Cu, Fe, Zn, V, Cd, Ni, As, Pb, Mn, Co, and
   Cr). Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry (GFAAS) and
   flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS) were used for elemental
   analysis. The findings were evaluated with sediment assessment methods
   by taking two different values as a reference and then investigating the
   adverse biological effects of elemental profiles on living organisms.
   Pb, Mn, As, Cd, and Cr concentrations were within a moderate to
   significant range in terms of contamination factor (C-f(i)), albeit
   varying according to reference and location. Themost problematic region
   and elements regarding the enrichment factor (EF) wasAyvalik and As, Ni,
   Cu, Pb, Co, and Cd. However, according to the EF, the anthropogenic
   effect was not at an alarming level. This was further supported by the
   results of the geoaccumulation index (Igeo). The findings of themodified
   degree of contamination (mC(d)) and the pollution load index (PLI)
   suggested that the accumulation was greatest in Ayvalik, and the least
   in Hekimadasi and Ildir. The location with the highest elemental total
   toxic unit (Sigma TU) was Edremit. The effect of the existing element
   profile on organisms was 21\% in this location when the mean effect
   range-median quotient (m-ERM-q) was considered. As and Ni concentrations
   in all stations were found to be higher than threshold effect level
   (TEL) and Effect Range Low (ERL). Ni levels in Edremit exceeded the

Abstract = {{Aim: The aim was to examine whether recent mortality can be explained by
   hydraulic failure linked to water deficit.
   Location: Western Europe.
   Time period: 1986-2014.
   Major taxa studied: Forty-four tree species.
   Methods: We modelled the hydraulic safety margin (HSM) across the ranges
   of 44 tree species at their driest margin (n=193,261 plots), defined as
   the difference between the estimated minimal soil water potential of
   each plot and the species water stress threshold, which corresponds to
   the hydraulic failure of the vascular system. Soil water potential was
   estimated by applying Campbell's equations on the minimal and maximal
   soil water contents estimated from 1979 to 2010 in the top 289 cm of
   soil and five soil textures across the species ranges. For each species,
   we modelled the amount of average mortality derived from plots of the
   Spanish and French National Forest Inventories to the variation in
   modelled hydraulic safety margin and environmental drivers across the
   species ranges using hurdle models.
   Results: We did not identify any global convergence of modelled HSM
   within the species distribution ranges, finding instead a rather large
   variability in modelled HSM for most of the studied species. Fifteen
   species, out of 25 for which the models were practicable, showed
   significantly higher mortality in populations with negative HSM in
   comparison to those showing positive HSM, with positive and negative
   interaction along the aridity index.
   Main conclusions: The combination of competition, average climate and
   modelled HSM explained average tree mortality. Most of the species
   presented at least one population that had already experienced a
   negative HSM and many other populations a positive but narrow HSM,
   suggesting that climate change is likely to push some populations
   towards a higher risk of hydraulic failure in the drier conditions
   projected for Western Europe.}},

   errors resulting from instrument malfunction or calibration drifts from
   natural (environmentally driven) regional changes in ambient
   concentrations. Our case study considered hourly-averaged ozone data

Abstract = {{An estimate of a river's natural flow regime is useful for water
   resource planning and ecosystem rehabilitation by providing insight into
   the predisturbance form and function of a river. The natural flow regime
   of most rivers has been perturbed by development during the 20th century
   and in some cases, before stream gaging began. The temporal resolution
   of natural flows estimated using traditional methods is typically not
   sufficient to evaluate cues that drive native ecosystem function.
   Additionally, these traditional methods are watershed specific and
   require large amounts of data to produce accurate results. We present a
   mass balance method that estimates natural flows at daily time step
   resolution for the northern branch of the Rio Grande, upstream from the
   Rio Conchos, that relies only on easily obtained streamflow data. Using
   an analytical change point method, we identified periods of the measured
   flow regime during the 20th century for comparison with the estimated
   natural flows. Our results highlight the significant deviation from
   natural conditions that occurred during the 20th century. The total
   annual flow of the northern branch is 95\% lower than it would be in the
   absence of human use. The current 2 year flood has decreased by more
   than 60\%, is shorter in duration, and peaks later in the year. When
   compared to unregulated flows estimated using traditional mass balance
   accounting methods, our approach provides similar results.}},

Abstract = {{New indices - modified hazard quotient (m HQ) and ecological
   contamination index (ECI) -were developed for the evaluation of heavy
   metals contamination of sediment. Sequential extraction method was
   employed to determine the levels of cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper
   (Cu), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) in subtidal sediment samples from
   tropical ecosystems off the Gulf of Guinea. The results were used to
   assess the degree of contamination and estimate the extent of
   anthropogenic inputs from industrial activities. Results indicated that
   the concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb ranged from 4.33 -5.67,
   11.12-28.52, 30.26-43.72, 2.02-2.60 and 162.0-190.37 mg/kg dw,
   respectively. The mean metal levels did not show significant variations
   among study sites during the wet and dry seasons. Spatial distribution
   and severity of sediment-associated contamination by heavy metals based
   on the newly developed indices (m HQ and ECI) were in good agreement
   with existing pollution indices and followed the descending sequence:
   Cd>Pb>Cu>Cr>Ni. Contamination severity index, mean hazard quotient and
   modified risk assessment code were also used to evaluate the
   sediment-heavy metal contamination, which generally indicated medium
   risk contamination of the investigated ecosystems. Aquatic pollution
   indicators (potential contamination index, ECI, hazard quotients, m HQ)
   revealed significant anthropogenic contamination by Cd and Pb, while Cr,
   Cu and Ni showed relatively low degree of contamination. Potential
   contamination index (PCI) generally followed the sequence
   Cd>Pb>Cu>Cr>Ni. A comparison of newly proposed indices with existing
   pollution indices revealed very good agreement. The contamination trends
   derived from the new indices were consistent and took into consideration
   site specificity, toxicity and a three-tier effect levels (threshold,
   mid-range and extreme effects guideline values) that support their
   reliability in evaluating contaminated aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{The perspective of strong/weak sustainability has a great impact on

   Ecological Footprint (EF) and Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) for
   strong and weak sustainability assessment, were employed to evaluate the

   results showed that the ecological footprint had been enlarged in the

   increase since 2005. The cities of Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, and
   Shanghai met the threshold of below 2.5 global hectares for EF /capita,
   and over 3000 dollars/capita (in 2010 US\$) for GPI/capita. By analyzing
   and comparing the characteristics, the processes and results, and the
   complementary features of evaluation methods of EF and GPI, the research
   suggested that: (1) Strong and weak sustainability indicators, with
   their own pros/cons in sustainability assessment, should be used
   carefully; (2) Weak sustainability indicators could be analyzed from the

Abstract = {{It is often of interest to model the incidence and duration of threshold
   exceedance events for an environmental variable over a set of monitoring
   locations. Such data arrive over continuous time and can be considered
   as observations of a two-state process yielding, sequentially, a length
   of time in the below threshold state followed by a length of time in the
   above threshold state, then returning to the below threshold state, etc.
   We have a two-state continuous time Markov process, often referred to as
   an alternating renewal process. The process is observed over a truncated
   time window and, within this window, duration in each state is modeled
   using a distinct cumulative intensity specification. Initially, we model
   each intensity over the window using a parametric regression
   specification. We extend the regression specification adding temporal
   random effects to enrich the model using a realization of a log Gaussian
   process over time. With only one type of renewal, this specification is
   referred to as a Gaussian process modulated renewal process. Here, we
   introduce Gaussian process modulation to the intensity for each state.
   Model fitting is done within a Bayesian framework. We clarify that
   fitting with a customary log Gaussian process specification over a
   lengthy time window is computationally infeasible. The nearest neighbor
   Gaussian process, which supplies sparse covariance structure, is adopted
   to enable tractable computation. We propose methods for both generating
   data under our models and for conducting model comparison. The model is
   applied to hourly ozone data for four monitoring sites at different
   locations across the United States for the ozone season of 2014. For
   each site, we obtain estimated profiles of up-crossing and down-crossing
   intensity functions through time. In addition, we obtain inference
   regarding the number of exceedances, the distribution of the duration of
   exceedance events, and the proportion of time in the above and below
   threshold state for any time interval.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Excessive summer heat is a serious environmental health
   problem in several European cities. Heat-related mortality and morbidity
   is likely to increase under climate change scenarios without adequate
   prevention based on locally relevant evidence.
   Methods: We modelled the urban climate of Antwerp for the summer season
   during the period 1986-2015, and projected summer daily temperatures for
   two periods, one in the near (2026-2045) and one in the far future
   (2081-2100), under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5.
   We then analysed the relationship between temperature and mortality, as
   well as with hospital admissions for the period 2009-2013, and estimated
   the projected mortality in the near future and far future periods under
   changing climate and population, assuming alternatively no
   acclimatization and acclimatization based on a constant threshold
   percentile temperature.
   Results: During the sample period 2009-2013 we observed an increase in
   daily mortality from a maximum daily temperature of 26 degrees C, or the
   89th percentile of the maximum daily temperature series. The annual
   average heat-related mortality in this period was 13.4 persons (95\% CI:
   3.8-23.4). No effect of heat was observed in the case of hospital
   admissions due to cardiorespiratory causes. Under a no acclimatization
   scenario, annual average heat-related mortality is multiplied by a
   factor of 1.7 in the near future (24.1 deaths/year CI 95\%: 6.78-41.94)
   and by a factor of 4.5 in the far future (60.38 deaths/year CI 95\%:
   17.00-105.11). Under a heat acclimatization scenario, mortality does not
   increase significantly in the near or in the far future.
   Conclusion: These results highlight the importance of a long-term
   perspective in the public health prevention of heat exposure,
   particularly in the context of a changing climate, and the calibration
   of existing prevention activities in light of locally relevant evidence.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{233-244}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The importance of quantifying the contribution of historical
   processes in shaping current biodiversity patterns is now recognized,
   but quantitative approaches that explicitly link speciation, extinction
   and dispersal processes to palaeo-environmental changes are currently
   lacking. Here, we propose a spatial diversification model of lineages
   through time (SPLIT) based on the reconstruction of palaeo-environments.
   We illustrate our approach using mangroves as a case study and evaluate
   whether habitat changes caused by plate tectonics explain the current
   biodiversity patterns of this group.
   Innovations: The SPLIT model allows one to simulate the evolutionary
   dynamics of species ranges by spatially linking speciation, extinction
   and dispersal processes to habitat changes over geological time periods.
   The SPLIT model provides a mechanistic expectation of speciation and
   extinction assuming that species are ecologically identical and not
   interacting. The likelihood of speciation and extinction is equivalent
   across species and depends on two dispersal parameters interacting with
   habitat dynamics (d a maximum dispersal distance and ds a distance
   threshold beyond which gene flow is absent). Beyond classical
   correlative approaches, this model tracks biodiversity dynamics under
   palaeo-environmental changes and provides multiple expectations (i.e.,
   alpha-, beta-diversity, phylogenies) that can be compared to empirical
   patterns.
   Main conclusions: The SPLIT model allows a better understanding of the
   origin of biodiversity by explicitly accounting for habitat changes over
   geological times. The simulations applied to the mangrove case study
   reproduced the observed longitudinal gradient in species richness, the
   empirical pattern of beta-diversity and also provided inference on
   diversification rates. Future developments may include niche evolution
   and species interactions to evaluate the importance of non-neutral
   mechanisms. The method is fully implemented in the InsideDNA platform
   for bioinformatics analyses, and all modelling results can be accessed
   via interactive web links.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is one of the most fiercely debated scientific issues in
   recent decades, and the changes in climate extremes are estimated to
   have greater negative impacts on human society and the natural
   environment than the changes in mean climate. Extreme value theory is a
   well-known tool that attempts to best estimate the probability of
   adversarial risk events. In this paper, the focus is on the statistical
   behaviour of extreme maximum values of temperature. Under the framework
   of this theory, the methods of block maxima and threshold exceedances
   are employed. Due to the non-stationary characteristic of the series of
   temperature values, the generalized extreme value distribution and the
   generalized Pareto distribution were extended to the non-stationary
   processes by including covariates in the parameters of the models. For
   the purpose of obtaining an approximately independent threshold
   excesses, a declustering method was performed and then the de-clustered
   peaks were fitted to the generalized Pareto distribution. The stationary
   Gumbel distribution was found a reasonable model for the annual block
   maxima; however, a non-stationary generalized extreme value distribution
   with quadratic trend in the location was recommended for the half-yearly
   period. The findings also show that there is an improvement in modelling
   daily maxima temperature when it is applied to the declustered series
   and the given model outperforms the non-stationary generalized Pareto
   distribution models. Furthermore, the retained generalized Pareto
   distribution model proved better than the generalized extreme value
   distribution. Estimates of the return levels obtained from both extreme
   value models show that new records on maximum temperature event could
   appear within the next 20, 50 and 100 years.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops an Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare for Spain
   from 1970 to 2012 and seeks to update valuation approaches to a number
   of items. Two approaches have proven particularly controversial over
   recent decades; the costs of energy depletion and of climate change. The
   valuation implications in measuring present welfare have proven
   problematic, as both include future sustainability consequences arising
   from resource depletion and environmental impacts. This study includes a
   `transition cost' approach to energy depletion, a modified approach to
   costs of climate change and water pollution, and removes the cost of
   ozone depletion. The results illustrate that while GDP per capita
   increased significantly, the ISEW per capita shows a widening gap.
   Household labour contributes strongly, but income distribution, energy
   depletion and costs of climate change limit improvement. Sensitivity
   analysis shows that accumulating climate change costs and escalating
   energy depletion costs have significant effects. Nevertheless, the new
   valuation approaches do not alter conclusions that welfare has shown
   little improvement. The ISEW provides a useful alternative to current
   indicators such as GDP subject to awareness of limitations. It is a
   measure of welfare that uses sustainability accounting methods when
   estimating costs, but is not an indicator of whether welfare is actually

   The global farm-specific data set of 890 observations across 14

   grown under Unilever's sustainable agricultural code. It represents on
   average 3\% of the annual global production of processing tomatoes:
   insights can be used to help inform corporate' sourcing strategies and
   certification schemes. The median GHG footprint ranged from 18 in Chile
   to 61 kg CO2-equiv per tonne of tomatoes in India, lower than results
   reported in other studies. We found that footprints are more consistent
   within countries than between them. Using linear mixed effect models, we
   quantified the relative influence of environmental conditions and farm
   management factors. Key variables were area of production and the method
   of fertilizer application. GHG footprints decreased with increasing area
   of production to a threshold of 17.4 ha. Farms using single fertilizer
   application methods in general had a larger GHG footprint than those
   using a combination of methods. We conclude that farm management factors
   should be prioritized for future data collection, and more stringent
   guidance on acceptable practices is required if greater comparability of
   outcomes is needed either within a scheme, such as the Unilever's

   drought-tolerant trees in the past or drought-intolerant trees
   currently. We conclude that fire is a parsimonious explanation for

   forests. Fire exclusion was unprecedented during early 20th century and
   loss of this driver provides a mechanism for forest transitions.}},

Abstract = {{Conflict over water resources emerges from complex interactions among
   biophysical, social, and economic processes operating at multiple
   scales. Competing use of linked surface-groundwater (LSGW) resources is
   an excellent yet relatively unexplored example of such conflict. Dynamic
   circumstances surrounding the contested installation of a high capacity
   municipal well in southeastern Wisconsin were examined through the
   theoretical lens of adaptive governance using document analysis and
   open-ended key stakeholder interviews. A framework analysis method
   extracted 16 controlling variables from the qualitative data. These
   controlling variables were placed on a threshold matrix at their
   appropriate geospatial scale (Property, Watershed, State) and process
   domain (Biophysical, Economic, Social), which revealed several
   social-ecological feedbacks not currently addressed by management
   authorities. Three dynamic feedback loops were identified that explain
   the emergence and resolution of LSGW conflict in the case study area.
   Conflict emerged when processes driving new development in southeastern
   Wisconsin threatened to impact a highly valued groundwater dependent
   lake. Lake groups engaged in collective learning, utilized information
   networks, and displayed leadership to address the issue. However, lack
   of participatory avenues for dispute resolution at the scale of
   occurrence drove lake groups to challenge the regulatory authority of
   the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR). Through
   order-based legitimacy, legal resolution affected governance of LSGW
   resources across the state, but did little to address the underlying
   stakeholder values driving conflict. We conclude this system will
   continue to be subjected to ``legal back and forth,{''} recurrent
   conflict, and uncertainty for both environmental and developmental
   interests until a more participatory process is developed with
   regulatory authorities to resolve conflicts over LSGW.}},

Abstract = {{Large environmental datasets usually include outliers which can have
   significant effects on further analysis and modelling. There exist
   various outlier detection methods that depend on the distribution of the
   analysed variable. However quite often the distribution of environmental
   variables can not be estimated. This paper presents an approach for
   identification of outliers in environmental time series which does not
   impose restrictions on the distribution of observed variables. The
   suggested algorithm combines kernel smoothing and extreme value
   estimation techniques for stochastic processes within considerations of
   nonstationary expected value of the process. The nonstationarity in
   variance is evaded by change point analysis which precedes the proposed
   algorithm. Possible outliers are identified as observations with rare
   occurrence and, in correspondence to extreme value methodology, the
   confidence limits for high values of observed variables are constructed.
   The proposed methodology can be especially convenient for cases where
   validation of the data has to be carried out manually, since it
   significantly reduces the number of implausible observations. For a case
   study, the technique is applied for outlier detection in time series of
   hourly PM10 concentrations in Brno, Czech Republic. The methodology is
   derived on solid theoretical results and seems to perform well for the
   series of PM10. However its flexibility makes it generally applicable
   not only to series of atmospheric pollutants. On the other hand, the
   choice of return level turns out to be crucial in sensitivity to the
   outliers. This issue should be left to the practitioners to decide with
   respect to specific application conditions. (C) 2017 Turkish National

Abstract = {{The revolutions in the maritime industry resulting from the

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Transferring plant material during ecological restoration has inherent
   risk. The use of seed transfer guidelines minimizes the possibility of
   introducing maladapted genotypes. We delineated biogeographic regions
   relevant to the distribution of Cercocarpus montanus for the purpose of
   creating provisional seed transfer zones for ecological restoration. We
   also modeled seed transfer guidelines using quantitative estimates of
   environmental tolerance and thresholds. Analyses identified broadscale
   environmental patterns relevant for seed transfer success. First, a
   species distribution model was used to identify the distribution of
   C.montanus. Next, we used non-metric multidimensional scaling to
   investigate the structure of environmental data, and hierarchical
   cluster analysis to delineate biogeographic regions (i.e., environmental
   discontinuities) using species distribution data. Finally, we calculated
   measures of environmental tolerance and thresholds for C.montanus to
   model the probability of seed transfer success with multiple logistic
   regression. Biogeographic regionalization of C.montanus resulted in four
   major clusters, which agreed with ordination methods. Logistic
   regression was implemented using estimates of environmental tolerance
   and threshold data to model seed transfer success. We compared our
   species-specific seed transfer zones and guidelines with other
   provisional seed transfer zone methods and found that our
   species-specific methods performed better at explaining phenotypic
   variation of C.montanus in four out of six cases. Seed transfer zones
   are useful for restoration planning; however, zonal models fail to
   reflect much of the environmental heterogeneity present across the range
   of C.montanus. Continuous models for seed transfer success using
   environmental tolerance and thresholds enhance the development and use
   of seed transfer guidelines because they reflect landscape heterogeneity
   at a fine scale, and the results are relative to restoration sites of
   interest. Herein, we describe a methodology to construct provisional
   seed transfer zones and continuous seed transfer guidelines using
   species-specific distribution models and multivariate analyses.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed concentration levels of particulate matter (PM) in

   suspended particles (TSP)) in 10 locations taking into consideration
   land use patterns. Surfer (R) version 8 (Golden Software LLC, USA) was
   used to model the spatial variation of particulate matter concentration
   levels using kriging interpolation griding method. Human exposure
   assessment was done using the total respiratory deposition dose (TRDD)
   estimates and statutory limit breach (SLB) approaches. The appearance of
   dominating weak southern atmospheric wind flow was observed as wind
   speed ranged from 0 to 6.811 m/s while solar radiation periods ranged
   from 0.3 to 3.5 h/day. The relative humidity of the metropolis ranged

   strong negative correlations existed between the PM concentration levels
   and microclimatic parameters. Spatial variation of the concentration
   level as modelled using Surfer (R) version 8 indicated that particulate

Abstract = {{Hypoxic or oxygen-free zones are linked to large-scale mortalities of

   understand the implications of long-term exposure on fish and their
   ability to acclimate. To test the effects of long-term exposure (months)
   of fish to hypoxia we devised a novel method to control the level of
   available oxygen. Juvenile golden perch (Macquaria ambigua ambigua), and
   silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus), two key native species found within
   the Murray Darling Basin, Australia, were exposed to different
   temperatures (20, 24 and 28 degrees C) combined with normoxic (6-8
   mgO(2) L-1 or 12-14 kPa) and hypoxic (3-4 mgO(2) L-1 or 7-9 kPa)
   conditions. After 10 months, fish were placed in individual respirometry
   chambers to measure standard and maximum metabolic rate (SMR and MMR),
   absolute aerobic scope (AAS) and hypoxia tolerance. Golden perch had a
   much higher tolerance to hypoxia exposure than silver perch, as most
   silver perch died after only 1 month exposure. Golden perch acclimated
   to hypoxia had reduced MMR at 20 and 28 degrees C, but there was no
   change to SMR. Long-term exposure to hypoxia improved the tolerance of
   golden perch to hypoxia, compared to individuals held under normoxic
   conditions suggesting that golden perch can acclimate to levels around 3
   mgO(2) L-1 (kPa similar to 7) and lower. The contrasting tolerance of

Abstract = {{It is critical for surface water management systems to provide
   earlywarnings of abrupt, large variations inwater quality, which likely
   indicate the occurrence of spill incidents. In this study, a combined
   approach integrating a wavelet artificial neural network (wavelet-ANN)
   model and high-frequency surrogate measurements is proposed as a method
   of water quality anomaly detection and warning provision. High-frequency
   time series of major water quality indexes (TN, TP, COD, etc.) were
   produced via a regression-based surrogate model. After wavelet
   decomposition and denoising, a low-frequency signalwas imported into a
   back-propagation neural network for one-step prediction to identify the
   major features of water quality variations. The precisely trained
   sitespecific wavelet-ANN outputs the time series of residual errors. A
   warning is triggered when the actual residual error exceeds a given
   threshold, i.e., baseline pattern, estimated based on long-term water
   quality variations. A case study based on the monitoring programapplied
   to the Potomac River Basin in Virginia, USA, was conducted. The
   integrated approach successfully identified two anomaly events of TP
   variations at a 15-minute scale from high-frequency online sensors. A
   storm event and point source inputs likely accounted for these events.
   The results showthat the wavelet-ANN model is slightly more accurate
   than the ANN for high-frequency surfacewater quality prediction, and it
   meets the requirements of anomaly detection. Analyses of the performance
   at different stations and over different periods illustrated the
   stability of the proposed method. By combining monitoring instruments
   and surrogate measures, the presented approach can support timely
   anomaly identification and be applied to urban aquatic environments for
   watershed management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mining activity is an increasingly important stressor for freshwater
   ecosystems. However, the mechanism on how sulfate-rich mine drainage
   affects freshwater ecosystems is largely unknown, and its potential
   ecological risk has not been assessed so far. During 2009-2016, water
   and macroinvertebrate samples from 405 sample sites were collected along
   the mine drainage gradient from circum-neutral to alkaline waters in
   Hun-Tai River, Northeastern China. Results of linear regressions showed
   that sulfate-rich mine drainage was significantly positively correlated
   with the constituents typically derived from rock weathering (Ca2+, Mg2+
   and HCO3- + CO32-); the diversity of intolerant stream
   macroinvertebrates exhibited a steep decline along the gradient of
   sulfate-rich mine drainage. Meanwhile, stressor-response relationships
   between sulfate-rich mine drainage and macroinvertebrate communities
   were explored by two complementary statistical approaches in tandem
   (Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis and the field-based method developed
   by USEPA). Results revealed that once stream sulfate concentrations in
   mine drainage exceeded 35 mg/L, significant decline in the abundance of
   intolerant macroinvertebrate taxa occurred. An assessment of ecological
   risk posed by sulfate-rich mine drainage was conducted based on a tiered
   approach consisting of simple deterministic method (Hazard Quotient, HQ)
   to probabilistic method (Joint Probability Curve, JPC). Results
   indicated that sulfate-rich mine drainage posed a potential risk, and
   64.62-84.88\% of surface waters in Hun-Tai River exist serious risk
   while 5\% threshold (HC05) and 1\% threshold (HC01) were set up to
   protect macroinvertebrates, respectively. This study provided us a
   better understanding on the impacts of sulfate-rich mine drainage on
   freshwater ecosystems, and it would be helpful for future catchment
   management to protect streams from mining activity. (C) 2017 Published

Title = {{Estimating species pools for a single ecological assemblage}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: The species pool concept was formulated over the past
   several decades and has since played an important role in explaining
   multi-scale ecological patterns. Previous statistical methods were
   developed to identify species pools based on broad-scale species range
   maps or community similarity computed from data collected from many
   areas. No statistical method is available for estimating species pools
   for a single local community (sampling area size may be very small as <=
   1 km(2)). In this study, based on limited local abundance information,
   we developed a simple method to estimate the area size and richness of a
   species pool for a local ecological community. The method involves two
   steps. In the first step, parameters from a truncated negative trinomial
   model characterizing the distributional aggregation of all species
   (i.e., non-random species distribution) in the local community were
   estimated. In the second step, we assume that the unseen species in the
   local community are most likely the rare species, only found in the
   remaining part of the species pool, and vice versa, if the remaining
   portion of the pool was surveyed and was contrasted with the sampled
   area. Therefore, we can estimate the area size of the pool, as long as
   an abundance threshold for defining rare species is given. Since the
   size of the pool is dependent on the rarity threshold, to unanimously
   determine the pool size, we developed an optimal method to delineate the
   rarity threshold based on the balance of the changing rates of species
   absence probabilities in the sampled and unsampled areas of the pool.
   Results: For a 50 ha (0.5 km(2)) forest plot in the Barro Colorado
   Island of central Panama, our model predicted that the local, if not
   regional, species pool for the 0.5 km(2) forest plot was nearly the
   entire island. Accordingly, tree species richness in this pool was
   estimated as around 360. When the sampling size was smaller, the upper
   bound of the 95\% confidence interval could reach 418, which was very
   close to the flora record of tree richness for the island. A numerical
   test further demonstrated the power and reliability of the proposed
   method, as the true values of area size and species richness for the
   hypothetical species pool have been well covered by the 95\% confidence
   intervals of the true values.
   Conclusions: Our method fills the knowledge gap on estimating species
   pools for a single local ecological assemblage with little information.
   The method is statistically robust and independent of sampling size, as
   proved by both empirical and numerical tests.}},

Abstract = {{Urban greenspaces are important areas for biodiversity, serving multiple
   uses, sometimes including conservation and biodiversity management.
   Citizen science provides a cheap and potentially effective method of
   assisting biodiversity management in urban greenspaces. Despite this
   potential, the minimum amount of citizen science data required to
   adequately represent a community is largely untested. We used eBird data
   to test the minimum sampling effort required to be confident in results
   for three biological metrics, species richness, Shannon diversity, and
   community composition (Bray-Curtis similarity). For our data, from 30
   urban greenspaces in North America, for a 90\% threshold level, a
   minimum mean number of 210, 33, and 58 checklists were necessary for
   species richness, Shannon diversity, and community composition,
   respectively. However, when we eliminated those species that were
   present in fewer than 5\% of checklists at a given site, there was a
   marked decrease in mean minimum number of checklists required (17, 9,
   and 52, respectively). Depending on the ecological questions of
   interest, eBird data may be a potentially reliable data source in urban
   greenspaces. We provide a validation methodology using eBird data, with
   its associated code in the R statistical environment, to provide

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{B, SI}},
Pages = {{144-155}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite advances in our mechanistic understanding of ecological
   processes, the inherent complexity of real-world ecosystems still limits
   our ability in predicting ecological dynamics especially in the face of
   on-going environmental stress. Developing a model is frequently
   challenged by structure uncertainty, unknown parameters, and limited
   data for exploring out-of-sample predictions. One way to address this
   challenge is to look for patterns in the data themselves in order to
   infer the underlying processes of an ecological system rather than to
   build system-specific models. For example, it has been recently
   suggested that statistical changes in ecological dynamics can be used to
   infer changes in the stability of ecosystems as they approach tipping
   points. For computer scientists such inference is similar to the notion
   of a Turing machine: a computational device that could execute a program
   (the process) to produce the observed data (the pattern). Here, we make
   use of such basic computational ideas introduced by Alan Turing to
   recognize changing patterns in ecological dynamics in ecosystems under
   stress. To do this, we use the concept of Kolmogorov algorithmic
   complexity that is a measure of randomness. In particular, we estimate
   an approximation to Kolmogorov complexity based on the Block
   Decomposition Method (BDM). We apply BDM to identify changes in
   complexity in simulated time-series and spatial datasets from ecosystems
   that experience different types of ecological transitions. We find that
   in all cases, K-BDM complexity decreased before all ecological
   transitions both in time-series and spatial datasets. These trends
   indicate that loss of stability in the ecological models we explored is
   characterized by loss of complexity and the emergence of a regular and
   computable underlying structure. Our results suggest that Kolmogorov
   complexity may serve as tool for revealing changes in the dynamics of
   ecosystems close to ecological transitions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem deterioration has been and is still a serious threat to human
   survival and regional economic development. Theoretical and
   methodological challenges exist in assessing ecological risk of
   watershed ecosystem that is imposed by natural changes or human
   activities. To fill this research gap, this research proposes an
   interdisciplinary and quantitative methodology based on some techniques
   such as the Procedure for Ecological Tiered Assessment of Risk (PETAR),
   the Entropy, and the Celluar Automata Markov (CA-Markov). We focused on
   six vulnerable environmental variables, namely land-use change, water
   quantity, water quality, gross domestic product (GDP), environmental
   pollutants, and soil erosion in the Huai River watershed in the Henan
   Province in order to build multi-dimensional quantitative method.
   Further, the Coupling Coordination Degree Model is constructed, and the
   threshold index is also addressed to reflect the limitation of
   ecological risk. Our results show that the spatio-temperal distribution
   of the eco-environmental quality has greatly varied across this study
   area during different time spans. Natural eco-environmental quality has
   moderately degraded in 70\% of this study area (mainly agricultural
   region), at a prefectural level from 2000 to 2010, and has slightly
   improved over the agricultural region (<170 m above sea level) during
   2010-2015. However, when considering negative stressors from human
   social system on the natural ecosystem, the extent and distribution of
   the ecological risk varied across the whole area during 2000-2015. The
   results show that there was almost 90.40\% of this region under the
   ecological risk, with varying extents over the study time, e.g.,
   Kaifeng, Shangqiu, Xuchang, and Xinyang, with a moderate deterioration
   in the eco-environmental quality, and Zhengzhou with a slight
   deterioration in the eco-environmental quality. This paper provides a
   valuable perspective for governments at all levels to manage watershed

Abstract = {{The occurrence, toxicities, and ecological risks of five heavy metals
   (Pb, Cu, Cd, Zn and Ni) in the sediment of Taihu Lake were investigated
   in this study. To evaluate the toxicities caused by the heavy metals,
   the toxicities induced by organic contaminants and ammonia in the
   sediments were screened out with activated carbon and zeolite. The
   toxicities of heavy metals in sediments were tested with benthic
   invertebrates (tubificid and chironomid). The correlations between
   toxicity of sediment and the sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) derived
   previously were evaluated. There were significant correlations (p <
   0.0001) between the observed toxicities and the total risk quotients of
   the heavy metals based on SQGs, indicating that threshold effect level
   (TEL) and probable effect level (PEL) were reliable to predict the
   toxicities of heavy metals in the sediments of Taihu Lake. By contrast,
   the method based on acid volatile sulfides (AVS) and simultaneously
   extracted metals (SEM), such as Sigma SEM/AVS and Sigma SEM-AVS, did not
   show correlations with the toxicities. Moreover, the predictive ability
   of SQGs was confirmed by a total predicting accuracy of 77\%. Ecological
   risk assessment based on TELs and PELs showed that the contaminations of
   Pb, Cu, Cd and Zn in the sediments of Taihu Lake were at relatively low

Abstract = {{Soil quality indices (SQIs) were an important tool for evaluating
   agro-ecosystems. Salinization and alkalization are major environmental
   problems that have threatened agricultural productivity since ancient
   times. The aim of this study is to assess soil quality in salt-affected
   agricultural land in Kurdistan Province, Iran, using three indices; the
   Additive Soil Quality Index (SQI(a)), the Weighted Additive Soil Quality
   Index (SQI(w)), and the Nemoro Soil Quality Index (SQI(n)). Each of the
   soil quality indices were calculated using a Total Data Set (TDS) and a
   Minimum Data Set (MDS) approach. The TDS consisted of nine soil quality
   parameters measured on 150 samples (0-30 cm depth): pH, Electrical
   Conductivity (EC), Organic Carbon (OC), Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC),
   Carbonate Calcium Equivalent (CCE), Exchangeable Sodium Percentage
   (ESP), Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), Mean Weight Diameter (MWD), and
   Bulk Density (BD). Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to
   determine which indicators were to be included in the MDS. Indicator
   Kriging (IK) highlighted areas with a high risk of exceeding critical
   threshold values of EC, ESP, and SAR and having low soil quality. In
   non-salt-affected areas soil quality and the risk of exceeding critical
   threshold values and having low soil quality were lower and higher,
   respectively, compared to salt-affected regions. The MDS method showed a
   decrease in the area and proportion of grades with high and very high
   quality (I and II) and an increase in grades with low and very low
   quality (IV and V) compared to the TDS. The results of linear
   correlation, match, and kappa statistic analysis showed that soil
   quality was better estimated using the SQI(w) compared to the SQI(a) and
   the SQI(n). In addition there were higher values of agreement (match and
   kappa statistic) for the TSD than MSD. However, using the SQI(w) index
   and MDS method can adequately represent the TDS (R-2 = 0.82) and thus
   reduce the time and cost involved in evaluating soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Metals liberation and composition are decisive attributes in
   characterization of e-waste for metal recycling. Though end-of-life
   printed circuit board (PCB) is an integral part of e-waste as secondary
   resource reservoir, yet no standardized procedure exists for metals
   liberation and dissolution for its characterization. Thus, the paper
   aims at assessment of metals liberation upon comminution employing
   scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (SEM-EDS) followed by comparative assessment of the existing United
   States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) digestion procedures,
   viz., USEPA 3050B, USEPA 3051A, and USEPA 3052, in effective dissolution
   of metals from comminuted particles of waste PCBs of computer, laptop,
   mobile phone, and television. Effect of comminution and digestion
   conditions was assessed to have significant role in metal liberation and
   dissolution from PCBs. The SEM-EDS analysis demonstrated partial release
   of metals from the silica matrix of PCBs. The USEPA digestion methods
   showed statistically significant (P < 0.05) difference with greater
   dissolution of metals complexed to PCB matrix by the USEPA 3052 method
   owing to use of strong acid like hydrofluoric acid. Base metals like Cu
   and Zn and toxic metals such as Pb and Cd were present in abundance in
   PCBs and in general exceeded the total threshold limit concentration
   (TTLC). The maximum contents of Cu (20.13 +/- 0.04 wt.\%) and Zn (1.89
   +/- 0.05 wt.\%) in laptop PCBs, Pb (2.26 +/- 0.08 wt.\%) in TV PCBs, and

Abstract = {{Many studies in disease and ecological immunology rely on the use of
   assays that quantify the amount of specific antibodies (immunoglobulin)
   in samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are increasingly
   used in ecology due to their availability for a broad array of antigens
   and the limited amount of sampling material they require. Two recurrent
   methodological issues are nevertheless faced by researchers: (1) the
   limited availability of immunological assays and reagents developed for
   non-model species, and (2) the statistical determination of the cut-off
   threshold used to distinguish individual samples that are likely to have
   or not to have antibodies against a specific antigen. Here, we outline
   two solutions to deal with these issues. First, we show that
   implementing two assays with differing detection methods can help
   validate the use of reagents, such as antibodies, in species different
   from their intended target. We illustrate this by comparing the
   quantification of specific vaccinal antibodies against Newcastle disease
   virus (NDV) using two ELISA approaches in four seabird species (Cory's
   shearwater, European shag, European storm petrel and Southern rockhopper
   penguin). Second, we provide a simple way to determine from the
   distribution of ELISA values whether the assayed samples are likely to
   be made of a single group of individuals (likely negative) or of two
   groups of individuals (negative and positive). We illustrate the use of
   this approach with two independent datasets: NDV antibody levels
   following vaccination and anti-Borrelia antibody levels following
   natural exposure. The practical implementation of these methodological
   approaches could provide a way to efficiently apply ELISAs and other
   immune-based assays to address questions in the growing fields of
   ecological immunology and disease ecology.

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{188}},
Pages = {{73-80}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine whether toxicity in mouse
   fibroblast cells (3T3 cells) could predict toxicity in mice. Synthesized
   data on toxicity was subjected to regression analysis and it was
   observed that relationship of toxicities between mice and 3T3 cells was
   not strong (R-2 = 0.41). Inclusion of molecular descriptors (e.g.
   ionization, pKa) improved the regression to R-2 = 0.56, indicating that
   this relationship is influenced by kinetic processes of chemicals or
   specific toxic mechanisms associated to the compounds. However, to
   determine if we were able to discriminate modes of action (MOAs) in mice
   using the toxicities generated from 3T3 cells, compounds were first
   classified into ``baseline{''} and ``reactive{''} guided by the toxic
   ratio (TR) for each compound in mice. Sequence, binomial and recursive
   partitioning analyses provided strong predictions of MOAs in mice based
   upon toxicities in 3T3 cells. The correct classification of MOAs based
   on these methods was 86\%. Nearly all the baseline compounds predicted
   from toxicities in 3T3 cells were identified as baseline compounds from
   the TR in mice. The incorrect assignment of MOM for some compounds is
   hypothesized to be due to experimental uncertainty that exists in
   toxicity assays for both mice and 3T3 cells. Conversely, lack of
   assignment can also arise because some reactive compounds have MOAs that
   are different in mice compared to 3T3 cells. The methods developed here
   are novel and contribute to efforts to reduce animal numbers in toxicity
   tests that are used to evaluate risks associated with organic pollutants
   in the environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term (2000 to 2012) monthly data on communities of phytoplankton,
   and environmental variables were measured in water collected from
   Meiliang Bay and Wuli Lake of Tai Lake, China. Redundancy analysis (RDA)
   was conducted to explore relationships between the phytoplankton
   communities and environmental variables. Change points for
   concentrations of nutrients, which serve as early warnings of state
   shifts in lacustrine ecosystems, were identified using the Threshold
   Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN). The biomass of phytoplankton was
   positively correlated with the concentrations of total phosphorus (TP),
   suspended solids (SS), water temperature (WT), and pH but negatively
   correlated with the N/ P ratio (by mass) and Secchi disk depth (SD).
   Furthermore, TP, rather than other factors, was a controlling factor
   limiting the primary production of phytoplankton in most of this region.
   The change points for concentrations of TP controlling the occurrences
   of sensitive and tolerant taxa were 56.1 and 103.5 mu g TP/L,
   respectively. These results imply that an abrupt change in this
   lacustrine ecosystem has occurred in most parts of the study area, and
   the turbid state of this lake can be altered by reducing TP loading.
   This study provides an alternative ecological method for exploring the
   production of algal blooms and could advance the understanding of HABs.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands are one of the ecosystems that have been strongly affected by
   anthropogenic impacts. The state-ofthe-art in monitoring changes in
   grassland species composition is to conduct repeated plot-based
   vegetation surveys that assess the occurrence and cover of plants. These
   plot-based surveys are typically limited to comparably small areas and
   the quality of the cover estimates depends strongly on the experience
   and performance of the surveyors. Here, we investigate the possibility
   of a semi-automated, image-based method for cover estimates, by
   analyzing the applicability of very high spatial resolution
   hyperspectral data to classify grassland species at the level of
   individuals. This individual-oriented approach is seen as an alternative
   to community oriented remote sensing depicting canopy reflectance as the
   total of mixed species reflectance. An AISA + imaging spectrometer
   mounted on a scaffold was used to scan 1 m(2) grassland plots and assess
   the impact of four sources of variation on the predicted species cover:
   (1) the spatial resolution of the scans, (2) complexity, i.e. species
   number and structural diversity, (3) the species cover and (4) the share
   of functional types (graminoids and forbs). Classifications were
   conducted using a support vector machine classification with a linear
   kemel, obtaining a median Kappa of 0.8. Species cover estimations
   reached median r(2) and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.6 and 6.2\%
   respectively. We found that the spatial resolution and diversity level
   (mainly structural diversity) were the most important sources of
   variation affecting the performance of the proposed approach. A spatial
   resolution below 1 cm produced relatively good models for estimating
   species-specific coverages (r(2) = similar to 0.6; RMSE = similar to
   7.5\%) while predictions using pixel sizes over that threshold failed in
   this individual-oriented approach (r(2) = similar to 0.17; RMSE =
   similar to 20.7\%). Areas with low inter-species overlap were better
   suited than areas with frequent inter-species overlap. We conclude that
   the application of very high resolution hyperspectral remote sensing in
   environments with low structural heterogeneity is suited for
   individual-oriented mapping of grassland plant species.}},

Abstract = {{With rapid urbanization in the coastal zone and increasing habitat
   losses, it is imperative to understand how urban development affects
   coastal biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, it is
   important to understand how habitat fragments can best be incorporated
   into broader land use planning and coastal management, in order to
   maximize the environmental benefits they provide. In this study, we
   characterized the trade-offs between (a) urban development and
   individual mangrove environmental indicators (habitat quality and
   ecosystem services), and (b) between different environmental indicators
   in the tropical nation of Singapore. A range of biological, biophysical,
   and cultural indicators, including carbon, charcoal production, support
   for offshore fisheries, recreation, and habitat quality for a threatened
   species were quantified using field-based, remote sensing, and expert
   survey methods. The shape of the trade-off Pareto frontiers was analyzed
   to assess the sensitivity of environmental indicators for development.
   When traded off individually with urban development, four out of five
   environmental indicators were insensitive to development, meaning that
   relatively minor degradation of the indicator occurred while development
   was below a certain threshold, although indicator loss accelerated once
   this threshold was reached. Most of the pairwise relationships between
   the five environmental indicators were synergistic; only carbon storage
   and charcoal production, and charcoal production and recreational
   accessibility showed trade-offs. Trade-off analysis and land use
   optimization using Pareto frontiers could be a useful decision-support
   tool for understanding how changes in land use and coastal management

Abstract = {{1. Climate is widely assumed to influence physiological and demographic
   processes in trees, and hence forest composition, biomass and range
   limits. Growth in trees is an important barometer of climate change
   impacts on forests as growth is highly correlated with other demographic
   processes including tree mortality and fecundity.
   2. We investigated the main drivers of diameter growth for five common
   tree species occurring in the Rocky Mountains of the western United
   States using nonlinear regression methods. We quantified growth at the
   individual tree level from tree core samples collected across broad
   environmental gradients. We estimated the effects of both climate
   variation and biotic interactions on growth processes and tested for
   evidence that disjunct populations of a species respond differentially
   to climate.
   3. Relationships between tree growth and climate varied by species and
   location. Growth in all species responded positively to increases in
   annual moisture up to a threshold level. Modest linear responses to
   temperature, both positive and negative, were observed at many sites.
   However, model results also revealed evidence for differentiated
   responses to local site conditions in all species. In severe
   environments in particular, growth responses varied nonlinearly with
   temperature. For example, in northerly cold locations pronounced
   positive growth responses to increasing temperatures were observed. In
   warmer southerly climates, growth responses were unimodal, declining
   markedly above a threshold temperature level.
   4. Net effects from biotic interactions on diameter growth were negative
   for all study species. Evidence for facilitative effects was not
   detected. For some species, competitive effects more strongly influenced
   growth performance than climate. Competitive interactions also modified
   growth responses to climate to some degree.
   5. Synthesis. These analyses suggest that climate change will have
   complex, species-specific effects on tree growth in the Rocky Mountains
   due to nonlinear responses to climate, differentiated growth processes
   that vary by location and complex species interactions that impact
   growth and potentially modify responses to climate. Thus, robust model
   simulations of future growth responses to climate trends may need to
   integrate realistic scenarios of neighbourhood effects as well as
   variability in tree performance attributed to differentiated
   populations.}},

Title = {{Combining stable isotopes with contamination indicators: A method for
   improved investigation of nitrate sources and dynamics in aquifers with
   mixed nitrogen inputs}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{85-96}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Excessive nitrate (NO3-) concentration in groundwater raises health and
   environmental issues that must be addressed by all European Union (EU)
   member states under the Nitrates Directive and the Water Framework
   Directive. The identification of NO3- sources is critical to efficiently
   control or reverse NO3- contamination that affects many aquifers. In
   that respect, the use of stable isotope ratios N-15/N-14 and O-18/O-16
   in NO3- (expressed as delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3-, respectively)
   has long shown its value. However, limitations exist in complex
   environments where multiple nitrogen (N) sources coexist. This two-year
   study explores a method for improved NO3- source investigation in a
   shallow unconfined aquifer with mixed N inputs and a long established
   NO3- problem. In this tillage-dominated area of free-draining soil and
   subsoil, suspected NO3- sources were diffuse applications of artificial
   fertiliser and organic point sources (septic tanks and farmyards).
   Bearing in mind that artificial diffuse sources were ubiquitous,
   groundwater samples were first classified according to a combination of
   two indicators relevant of point source contamination: presence/absence
   of organic point sources (i.e. septic tank and/or farmyard) near
   sampling wells and exceedance/non-exceedance of a contamination
   threshold value for sodium (Na+) in groundwater. This classification
   identified three contamination groups: agricultural diffuse source but
   no point source (D+P-), agricultural diffuse and point source (D+P+) and
   agricultural diffuse but point source occurrence ambiguous (D+P +/-).
   Thereafter delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- data were superimposed on
   the classification. As delta N-15-NO3- was plotted against delta
   O-18-NO3-, comparisons were made between the different contamination
   groups. Overall, both delta variables were significantly and positively
   correlated (p < 0.0001, r(s) = 0.599, slope of 0.5), which was
   indicative of denitrification. An inspection of the contamination groups
   revealed that denitrification did not occur in the absence of point
   source contamination (group D+P-). In fact, strong significant
   denitrification lines occurred only in the D+P+ and D+P +/- groups (p <
   0.0001, r(s) > 0.6, 0.53 <= slope <= 0.76), i.e. where point source
   contamination was characterised or suspected. These lines originated
   from the 2-6\%o range for delta N-15-NO3-, which suggests that i) NO3-
   contamination was dominated by an agricultural diffuse N source (most
   likely the large organic matter pool that has incorporated N-15-depleted
   nitrogen from artificial fertiliser in agricultural soils and whose
   nitrification is stimulated by ploughing and fertilisation) rather than
   point sources and ii) denitrification was possibly favoured by high
   dissolved organic content (DOC) from point sources. Combining
   contamination indicators and a large stable isotope dataset collected
   over a large study area could therefore improve our understanding of the
   NO3- contamination processes in groundwater for better land use
   management.
   We hypothesise that in future research, additional contamination
   indicators (e.g. pharmaceutical molecules) could also be combined to
   disentangle NO contamination from animal and human wastes. (C) 2017

Title = {{A sampling design strategy to reduce survey costs in forest monitoring}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{182-191}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{High-quality data and long-term time series are the basis of any
   research activity dealing with natural resources analysis. Adequate
   sampling designs are fundamental to allow a robust statistical analysis
   to be representative of a relevant set of target variables. In this
   work, the sampling strategy of ICP-Forests Level II European network has
   been proposed to define more efficient and cost-effective procedures
   under the hypothesis that the average value of single-tree growth
   (increment) is a proxy of forest health. ICP plots have a fixed spatial
   structure consisting of a square of 50 x 50 m framed into 25 squared
   sub-plots. To estimate basal area (G) and increase over time (Delta G),
   two different sub-sampling methods have been implemented based on a
   measure of (i) the dominant layer only (i.e. a subset of the highest
   trees in the plot), and (ii) a random sample of squared sub-plots. While
   the vertical sampling procedure was performed using a progressive
   threshold, the horizontal sampling followed a bootstrapping procedure
   with random extraction without replacement. The mean absolute relative
   error (MARE) was used to evaluate quality of the two sub-sampling
   methods. Results highlighted a low predictive power with both
   methodologies, preventing the possibility to reduce the sampling efforts
   when estimating AG directly. In this context, the vertical sampling was
   strictly related to species-specific ecology, spatial structure and
   forest age, being influenced by vertical distribution of trees. The use
   of horizontal sampling for direct AG estimation led to systematically
   high errors. However, the use of horizontal sampling for total G
   estimation and indirect estimation of AG may reveal as a more effective
   procedure for a coherent representation of horizontal distribution of
   trees. Estimate AG as the difference between G values at time t and t +
   Delta t finally allows for a sensible reduction of costs with a
   controlled estimation error. An adequate level of MARE should be decided
   a-priori to select the number of sub-squares to be randomly sampled.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the high biodiversity and conservation concerns of the
   tropical dry forest, this study aim is to predict and evaluate the
   potential and current distributions of twelve species of endemic birds
   which distribute along the western slope of Mexico. The main goal is to
   evaluate altogether different methods for predicting actual species
   distribution models (ADMs) of the twelve species including the
   identification of key environmental potential limiting factors. ADMs for
   twelve endemic Mexican birds were generated and validated by means of
   applying: (1) three widely used species niche modeling approaches (ENFA,
   Garp, and Maxent); (2) two thresholding methods, based on ROC curves and
   Kappa Index, for transforming continuous models to presence/absence
   (binary) models; (3) documented habitat-species associations for
   reducing species potential distribution models (PDMs); and (4) field
   occurrence data for validating final ADMs. Binary PDMs' predicted areas
   seemed overestimated, while ADMs looked drastically reduced and
   fragmented because of the approach taken for eliminating those predicted
   areas which were documented as unsuitable habitat types for individual
   species. Results indicated that both thresholding methods generated
   similar threshold values for species modeled by each of the three
   species distribution modeling algorithms (SDMAs). A Wilcoxon signed-rank
   test, however, showed that Kappa values were generally higher than ROC
   curve for species modeled by ENFA and Maxent, while for Garp models
   there were no significant differences. Prediction success (e.g., true
   presences percentage) obtained from field occurrence data revealed a
   range of 50\%-82\% among the 12 species. The three modeling approaches
   applied enabled to test the application of two thresholding methods for
   transforming continuous to binary (presence/absence) models. The use of
   documented habitat preferences resulted in drastic reductions and
   fragmentation of PDMs. However, ADMs predictive success rate, tested
   using field species occurrence data, varied between 50 and 82\%.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid changes in state have been documented for many of Earth's

   cyanobacteria using a mobile sensor platform. Prior to the bloom, we
   detected theoretically predicted spatial EWIs based on variance and
   spatial autocorrelation, as well as a new index based on the extreme
   values. Changes in EWIs were not discernible in an unenriched reference
   lake. Despite the fluid environment of a lake where spatial

   physical mixing, spatial EWIs detected an approaching bloom suggesting
   the utility of spatial metrics for signaling ecological thresholds.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Some Vibrio spp. are pathogenic and ubiquitous in marine
   waters with low to moderate salinity and thrive with elevated sea
   surface temperature (SST).
   OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to monitor and project the suitability of
   marine conditions for Vibrio infections under climate change scenarios.
   METHODS: The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)
   developed a platform (the ECDC Vibrio Map Viewer) to monitor the
   environmental suitability of coastal waters for Vibrio spp. using
   remotely sensed SST and salinity. A case-crossover study of Swedish
   cases was conducted to ascertain the relationship between SST and Vibrio
   infection through a conditional logistic regression. Climate change
   projections for Vibrio infections were developed for Representative
   Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5.
   RESULTS: The ECDC Vibrio Map Viewer detected environmentally suitable
   areas for Vibrio spp. in the Baltic Sea in July 2014 that were
   accompanied by a spike in cases and one death in Sweden. The estimated
   exposure response relationship for Vibrio infections at a threshold of
   16 degrees C revealed a relative risk (RR) = 1.14 (95\% CI: 1.02, 1.27;
   p=0.024) for a lag of 2 wk; the estimated risk increased successively
   beyond this SST threshold. Climate change projections for SST under the
   RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios indicate a marked upward trend during the
   summer months and an increase in the relative risk of these infections
   in the coming decades.
   CONCLUSIONS: This platform can serve as an early warning system as the
   risk of further Vibrio infections increases in the 21st ritui due to
   climate change.}},

Pages = {{57-69}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The detection of non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) related impacts in
   freshwater environments by electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) has been
   clearly demonstrated in field conditions, but the mechanism generating
   the resistive signature is poorly understood. An electrical barrier
   mechanism which allows for detecting NAPLs with ERI is tested by
   developing a theoretical basis for the mechanism, testing the mechanism
   in a two-dimensional sand tank with ERI, and performing forward modeling
   of the laboratory experiment. The NAPL barrier theory assumes at low
   bulk soil NAPL concentrations, thin saturated NAPL barriers can block
   pore throats and generate a detectable electrically resistive signal.
   The sand tank experiment utilized a photographic technique to quantify
   petroleum saturation, and to help determine whether ERI can detect and
   quantify NAPL across the water table.
   This experiment demonstrates electrical imaging methods can detect small
   quantities of NAPL of sufficient thickness in formations. The bulk
   volume of NAPL is not the controlling variable for the amount of
   resistivity signal generated. The resistivity signal is primarily due to
   a zone of high resistivity separate phase liquid blocking current flow
   through the fully NAPL saturated pores spaces. For the conditions in
   this tank experiment, NAPL thicknesses of 3.3 cm and higher in the
   formation was the threshold for detectable changes in resistivity of 3\%
   and greater. The maximum change in resistivity due to the presence of
   NAPL was an increase of 37\%. Forward resistivity models of the
   experiment confirm the barrier mechanism theory for the tank experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Multilocus coalescent methods for inferring species trees or historical
   demographic parameters typically require the assumption that gene trees
   for sampled SNPs or DNA sequence loci are conditionally independent
   given their species tree. In practice, researchers have used different
   criteria to delimit independent loci. One criterion identifies sampled
   loci as being independent of each other if they undergo Mendelian
   independent assortment (IA criterion). O'Neill etal. (2013, Molecular
   Ecology, 22, 111-129) used this approach in their phylogeographic study
   of North American tiger salamander species complex. In two other
   studies, researchers developed a pair of related methods that employ an
   independent genealogies criterion (IG criterion), which considers the
   effects of population-level recombination on correlations between the
   gene trees of intrachromosomal loci. Here, I explain these three
   methods, illustrate their use with example data, and evaluate their
   efficacies. I show that the IA approach is more conservative, is simpler
   to use and requires fewer assumptions than the IG approaches. However,
   IG approaches can identify much larger numbers of independent loci than
   the IA method, which, in turn, allows researchers to obtain more precise
   and accurate estimates of species trees and historical demographic
   parameters. A disadvantage of the IG methods is that they require an
   estimate of the population recombination rate. Despite their drawbacks,
   IA and IG approaches provide molecular ecologists with promising a
   priori methods for selecting SNPs or DNA sequence loci that likely meet
   the independence assumption in coalescent-based phylogenomic studies.}},

   forest interiors and stand development? What are the locations, spatial
   extents and magnitudes of these effects?
   LocationThe 8500-ha Sylvania Wilderness Area, Michigan's Upper
   Peninsula, USA.
   MethodsWe conducted vegetation surveys in 202 plots in ten transects
   crossing the Sylvania Wilderness border in 2013 and 2014. We recorded
   characteristics of forest structure, trees, shrubs, saplings, seedlings
   and herbaceous species. We constructed GLMM to estimate the location,
   spatial extent and magnitude of change of edge effects on Sylvania with
   a range of possible edge effect locations and widths of effect. We
   selected best-fit models that minimized the AIC and applied likelihood
   ratio tests to assess the statistical significance of each edge effect.
   ResultsOverall, evidence of edge effects occurred up to 625m into the
   Sylvania Wilderness, with most significant changes occurring within 400m
   of the wilderness border. Wide zones of change occurred across the
   wilderness border, while zones of change farther from the edge tended to
   be narrower, suggesting that distinct environments are established
   beyond the transitional habitats surrounding the border region.
   Canopy-level and understorey-level variables exhibited the largest
   magnitudes and steepest gradients of change, indicating these
   communities are strongly influenced by edge effects in this forest
   system. Canopy-level heterogeneity also increased approaching the
   internal core area of Sylvania.
   ConclusionsIn this case study, we applied a linear change point model
   and found a minimum buffer zone of 400m to mitigate edge effects in an
   old-growth temperate mixed forest. Regionally, land managers could
   implement this buffer to existing edges of protected areas or negotiate
   this buffer zone in land acquisitions. A more stringent buffer zone of
   625m internal and 250m external to old-growth forests would be ideal.
   This application of change point analysis provides a simple, efficient
   method to establish effective buffer zones and to identify functional
   groups or ecosystem attributes for which edge effects are of greatest
   conservation concern. We recommend modifying our open-source change
   point package to estimate local edge effects that take into account
   regional characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrological models are widely used to investigate practical issues of
   water resources. Parametric uncertainty is considered as one of the most
   important sources of uncertainty in environmental researches. Generally,
   it is assumed that the parameters are independent mutually, but
   correlation within the parameter space is an important factor having the
   potential to cause uncertainty. The objective and innovation of this
   study was to address the effects of parameters correlation on a
   continuous hydrological model uncertainty. HEC-HMS with soil moisture
   accounting (SMA) infiltration method was used to model daily flows and
   simulate certainty bounds for Karoon III basin, southwest of IRAN, in
   two scenarios, independent and correlated parameters using 2-copula. The
   parameters were represented by probability distributions, and the effect
   on prediction error were evaluated using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS)
   on Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K),
   Clark storage-coefficient (R), and time of concentration (tc) were
   chosen for investigation, based on observed sensitivity analysis of
   simulated peak over threshold (POT). One hundred runs were randomly
   generated from 100 parameter sets captured from LHS of parameters
   distributions in each sub-basin. Using generated parameter sets, 100
   continuous hydrographs were simulated and values of certainty bounds
   calculated. Results showed that when 2-copula correlated R and tc, with
   0.656 Kendall's Tau and 0.818 Spearman's Rho coefficients, were
   propagated, decreasing of outputs' sharpness was more than when
   considering K and R (K-R), with 0.166 and 0.262; therefore,
   incorporation of correlations in the MCS is important, especially when
   the correlation coefficients exceed 0.65. The model was evaluated at the
   outlet of the basin using daily stream flow data. Model reliability was
   better for above-normal flows than normal and below-normal. Reliability
   increases of simulated flow when considering correlated R-tc was more
   than K-R because of the correlation values. Incorporation of copula for
   K-tc not only did not improve the model reliability but also decreased
   it. Results showed improvement of model reliability, by decreasing
   predicted error of hydrologic modeling, when dealing with correlated
   parameters in the system.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate wetland delineation is the basis of wetland definition and
   mapping, and is of great importance for wetland management and research.
   The Zoig Plateau on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was used as a research
   site for research on alpine wetland delineation. Several studies have
   analyzed the spatiotemporal pattern and dynamics of these alpine
   wetlands, but none have addressed the issues of wetland boundaries. The
   objective of this work was to discriminate the upper boundaries of
   alpine wetlands by coupling ecological methods and satellite
   observations. The combination of Landsat 8 images and supervised
   classification was an effective method for rapid identification of
   alpine wetlands in the Zoig Plateau. Wet meadow was relatively stable
   compared with hydric soils and wetland hydrology and could be used as a
   primary indicator for discriminating the upper boundaries of alpine
   wetlands. A slope of less than 4.5A degrees could be used as the
   threshold value for wetland delineation. The normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) in 434 field sites showed that a threshold value
   of 0.3 could distinguish grasslands from emergent marsh and wet meadow
   in September. The median normalized difference water index (NDWI) of
   emergent marsh remained more stable than that of wet meadow and
   grasslands during the period from September until July of the following
   year. The index of mean density in wet meadow zones was higher than the
   emergent and upland zones. Over twice the number of species occurred in
   the wet meadow zone compared with the emergent zone, and close to the
   value of upland zone. Alpine wetlands in the three reserves in 2014
   covered 1175.19 km(2) with a classification accuracy of 75.6\%. The
   combination of ecological methods and remote sensing technology will
   play an important role in wetland delineation at medium and small
   scales. The correct differentiation between wet meadow and grasslands is
   the key to improving the accuracy of future wetland delineation.}},

Abstract = {{In a wide range of indoor air pollutants, formaldehyde is one of the
   most-used and best-known substances. In order to protect human health,
   many countries have established threshold values for the release of
   formaldehyde from miscellaneous products and revise them constantly.
   Compliance with these regulations is usually assessed by emission test
   chamber measurements or derived methods. To control and improve the
   mechanisms of an emission test chamber, a reliable reference source with
   sample mimicking emission properties is required but not available so
   far. This study describes a permeation controlled reference source based
   on the application of paraformaldehyde as formaldehyde releasing
   polymeric compound. Interactions between the formaldehyde release of the
   source and the governing chamber parameters temperature, relative
   humidity and air velocity were investigated in 1 m(3) emission chambers.
   Depending on the conditions, constant formaldehyde concentrations
   between approximately 10 ppb and 150 ppb can be adjusted for up to 600
   h. A linear correlation between the logarithm of the chamber
   concentration and the reciprocal temperature was found. The results
   support the feasibility of the source for validation of emission test
   chamber performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   predictive ability of climate data derived from different statistical
   methods GLM5 were created using least correlated bioclimatic variables
   derived from two different climate data sets: 1) interpolated climate
   data (i.e. WORLDCLIM; Hijmans et al., 2005), and 2) quasi-mechanistical
   statistical downscaling (i.e. CHELSA; Karger et al., 2016). Model
   accuracy was evaluated using threshold-independent (Area Under the
   Curve) and threshold-dependent (True Skill Statistics) measures.
   Although there were no significant differences between the models in
   AUC, we found highly significant differences (p <= 0.01) in TSS. We
   conclude that models based on variables of CHELSA climate data had
   higher predictive power, whereas models using WORLDCLIM climate data
   consistently overpredicted the potential suitable habitat for B. utilis.
   Although climatic variables of WORLDCLIM are widely used in modelling

Abstract = {{The nitrogen dioxide/oxides of nitrogen (NO2/NOX) ratio is an important
   surrogate for NO to NO2 chemistry in dispersion models when estimating
   NOX impacts in a near-road environment. Existing dispersion models use
   different techniques and assumptions to represent NO to NO2 conversion
   and do not fully characterize all of the important atmospheric chemical
   and mechanical processes. Thus, ``real-world{''} ambient measurements
   must be analyzed to assess the behavior of NO2/NOX ratios near
   road-ways. An examination of NO2/NOX ratio data from a field study
   conducted in Las Vegas, Nevada (NV), from mid-December, 2008 through
   mid-December, 2009 provides insights into the appropriateness of
   assumptions about the NO2/NOx ratio included in dispersion models. Data
   analysis indicates multiple factors affect the downwind NO2/NOX ratio.
   These include spatial gradient, background ozone (O-3), source emissions
   of NO and NO2, and background NO2/NOX ratio. Analysis of the NO2/NOX
   ratio spatial gradient indicates that under high O-3 conditions, the
   change in the ratio is fairly constant once a certain O-3 threshold (>=
   30 ppb) is reached. However, under low O-3 conditions (<30 ppb), there
   are differences between weekdays and weekends, most likely due to a
   decline in O-3 concentrations during the weekday morning hours, reducing
   the O-3 available to titrate the emitted NO, allowing lower NO2/NOX
   ratios. These results suggest that under high O-3 conditions, NOX
   chemistry is driving the NO2/NOX ratios whereas under low O-3
   conditions, atmospheric mixing is the driving factor. Published by

Abstract = {{Context Terrestrial ecosystems, including tropical forests, are
   hypothesized to have tipping points beyond which environmental change
   triggers rapid and radical shifts to novel alternative states.
   Objective We explored the overarching hypothesis that fire-mediated
   alternative stable states exist in the semi-deciduous tropical forest
   zone of Ghana, and that increased fire activity has pushed some forests
   to a new state in which a novel ecosystem with low tree density is
   maintained by fire.
   Methods We combined a 30-year time series of remotely-sensed data with
   field measurements to assess land cover trends, the effects of fire on
   forest vegetation, and the reciprocal effects of vegetation change on
   fire regimes, in four forest reserves. We analyzed precipitation trends
   to determine if shifts in vegetation and fire regime reflected a shift
   to a drier climate.
   Results Two of the reserves experienced forest loss, were impacted by
   frequent fires, and transitioned to a vegetation community dominated by
   shrubs and grasses, which was maintained by fire-vegetation feedbacks.
   The other two reserves experienced less fire, retained higher levels of
   forest cover, and resisted fire encroachment from surrounding
   agricultural areas. Precipitation remained relatively stable, suggesting
   a hysteresis effect in which different vegetation states and fire
   regimes coexist within a similar climate.
   Conclusion There is potential for human land use and fire to create
   novel and persistent non-forest vegetation communities in areas that are
   climatically suitable for tropical forests. These disturbance-mediated
   regime shifts should be taken into account when assessing future
   trajectories of forest landscape change in West Africa.}},

   to assess the utility of satellite technology for detecting cyanoHAB
   frequency of occurrence at locations of potential management interest.

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vp) is a naturally occurring
   bacterium found in marine environments worldwide. It can cause
   gastrointestinal illness in humans, primarily through raw oyster
   consumption. Water temperatures, and potentially other environmental
   factors, play an important role in the growth and proliferation of Vp in
   the environment. Quantifying the relationships between environmental
   variables and indicators or incidence of Vp illness is valuable for
   public health surveillance to inform and enable suitable preventative
   measures. This study aimed to assess the relationship between
   environmental parameters and Vp in British Columbia (BC), Canada.
   Methods: The study used Vp counts in oyster meat from 2002-2015 and
   laboratory confirmed Vp illnesses from 2011-2015 for the province of BC.
   The data were matched to environmental parameters from publicly
   available sources, including remote sensing measurements of nighttime
   sea surface temperature (SST) obtained from satellite readings at a
   spatial resolution of 1 km. Using three separate models, this paper
   assessed the relationship between (1) daily SST and Vp counts in oyster
   meat, (2) weekly mean Vp counts in oysters and weekly Vp illnesses, and
   (3) weekly mean SST and weekly Vp illnesses. The effects of salinity and
   chlorophyll a were also evaluated. Linear regression was used to
   quantify the relationship between SST and Vp, and piecewise regression
   was used to identify SST thresholds of concern.
   Results: A total of 2327 oyster samples and 293 laboratory confirmed
   illnesses were included. In model 1, both SST and salinity were
   significant predictors of log(Vp) counts in oyster meat. In model 2, the
   mean log(Vp) count in oyster meat was a significant predictor of Vp
   illnesses. In model 3, weekly mean SST was a significant predictor of
   weekly Vp illnesses. The piecewise regression models identified a SST
   threshold of approximately 14 degrees C for both model 1 and 3,
   indicating increased risk of Vp in oyster meat and Vp illnesses at
   higher temperatures.
   Conclusion: Monitoring of SST, particularly through readily accessible
   remote sensing data, could serve as a warning signal for Vp and help
   inform the introduction and cessation of preventative or control
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{DNA damage and alterations in global DNA methylation status are
   associated with multiple human diseases and are frequently correlated
   with clinically relevant information. Therefore, assessing DNA damage
   and epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, is critical for
   predicting human exposure risk of pharmacological and biological agents.
   We previously developed a higher throughput platform for the single cell
   gel electrophoresis (comet) assay, CometChip, to assess DNA damage and
   genotoxic potential. Here, we utilized the methylation-dependent
   endonuclease, McrBC, to develop a modified alkaline comet assay,
   ``EpiComet,{''} which allows single platform evaluation of genotoxicity
   and global DNA methylation {[}5-methylcytosine (5-mC)] status of
   single-cell populations under user-defined conditions. Further, we
   leveraged the CometChip platform to create an EpiComet-Chip system
   capable of performing quantification across simultaneous exposure
   protocols to enable unprecedented speed and simplicity. This system
   detected global methylation alterations in response to exposures which
   included chemotherapeutic and environmental agents. Using EpiCometChip
   on 63 matched samples, we correctly identified single-sample
   hypermethylation (>= 1.5-fold) at 87\% (20/23), hypomethylation (>=
   1.25-fold) at 100\% (9/9), with a 4\% (2/54) false-negative rate (FNR),
   and 10\% (4/40) false-positive rate (FPR). Using a more stringent
   threshold to define hypermethylation (>= 1.75-fold) allowed us to
   correctly identify 94\% of hypermethylation (17/18), but increased our
   FPR to 16\% (7/45). The successful application of this novel technology

Abstract = {{This study presents a quantitative method to evaluate CO2 concentration
   ({[}CO2]) and stable carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13) as indicators for
   leakage detection at a geological carbon sequestration site by combining
   use of field release tests and a numerical modeling approach. A
   numerical model was developed to simulate CO2 dynamics by considering
   diffusion, dissolution in soil water, and soil respiration. The
   numerical model fits the background dynamics of {[}CO2] (360 to 550 ppm)
   and delta C-13 (-16\% to -6\%) well and reproduces fairly the overall
   trend observed during the CO2 release test. The model was further
   applied to assess detection probability (DP) of {[}CO2] and delta C-13
   for leakage detection in terms of various factors, such as CO2 leakage
   rate, background variations, delta C-13 of the CO2 leaked, and the
   threshold value of signal-to-noise ratio. Modeling results suggest that
   delta C-13 may have a higher DP than {[}CO2]. This study also shows that
   DP of delta C-13 for the IEA Weyburn project is close to 0, implying
   delta C-13 is inappropriate to be an indicator for CO2 leakage at the
   site. The quantitative method developed can also be used to design a
   monitoring plan or strategy in a near-surface environment for geological
   carbon sequestration. (C) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John

Abstract = {{Soil heavy metal contamination is a serious environmental problem. Human
   beings may be directly exposed to heavy metals in soils through the
   inhalation of soil particles, dermal contact, and oral ingestion, which
   can seriously threaten health. This study assesses the health risks
   associated with heavy metals in soils by determining the concentrations
   of eight heavy metals (Cr, Pb, Cd, Hg, As, Cu, Zn, and Ni) based on 2051
   surface-soil samples collected from the southern Yangtze River Delta of
   China. The mean concentrations were higher than the corresponding
   background values in Zhejiang Province and China as a whole, indicating
   an accumulation of heavy metals. The health risk assessment suggests
   that the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks in the study area were
   not significant. The non-carcinogenic risk for children was the highest,
   followed by those for adults and seniors; the non-carcinogenic risk for
   the entire population was less than 1.0, the predetermined threshold.
   Carcinogenic risk for adults was the highest, followed by those for
   seniors and children; a few sample points had a value larger than the
   threshold of 1.0E-04. Arsenic represented the greatest contribution to
   non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk. Meanwhile, ingestion of heavy
   metals in soil was the main exposure pathway for carcinogenic risk,
   followed by inhalation and dermal exposure. The spatial method of
   Getis-Ord was used to identify hot spots of health risk. Hot spots with
   high hazard index (HI) and total carcinogenic risk (TCR) for children,
   adults, and seniors were mainly distributed in core urban areas, such as
   Jiangbei, Haishu, Yinzhou, Jiangdong, and the urban areas of some other
   counties, which coincided with industrial, mining, and urban areas of
   the study area and were strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities.
   These results provide a basis for heavy metal control in soil, source
   identification, and environment management in the Yangtze River Delta

Abstract = {{Sclerochronological studies based on hard structures of marine organisms
   are valuable tools both for reconstructing past climate conditions and
   for predicting future impacts of environmental changes on marine
   resources. Existing archives, which house millions of fish otoliths (ear

   remain underutilized. The objective of this project was to identify the
   factors that influence the annual growth patterns of the European
   flounder (Platichthys flesus) based on an analysis of otolith
   increments. We applied linear mixed models to develop a 74-year long
   chronology that reflects the inter-annual variations in flounder growth
   rates using otolith samples collected from 1957 to 2016 in the southern
   part of the Baltic Sea, which is considered to be highly vulnerable to
   global climate change. By analyzing the widths of otolith increments we
   revealed the existence of common environmental factors that influence
   fish growth. Using a mixed modeling framework, we incorporated a recent
   method to identify the optimal time window for climatic factors and
   showed that the most significant effect of the mean Baltic Sea index
   occurs during August December, while mean sea surface temperature is
   most significant from April June. Change point analysis on the developed
   chronology identified major alterations occurred in flounder growth in
   1988, 1992 and 2006. This result is in accord with published studies on
   regime shifts in the Baltic Sea ecosystem. This paper reports
   information concerning the response of the commercially important
   European flounder to the changing environment that may support future
   ecosystem-based management of fish stocks. Moreover, the results also
   highlight the potential for applying biochronological techniques to

Abstract = {{Predicting the occurrence, level, and duration of high air pollution
   concentrations exceeding a given critical level enables researchers to
   study the health impact of road traffic on local air quality and to
   inform public policy action. Precise estimates of the probabilities of
   occurrence and level of extreme concentrations are formidable due to the
   combination of complex physical and chemical processes involved. This
   underpins the need for developing sophisticated extreme value models, in
   particular allowing for nonstationarity of environmental time series. In
   this paper, extremes of nitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and
   ozone (O-3) concentrations are investigated using two models. ModelI is
   based on an extended peaks-over-threshold (POT) approach developed by A.
   C. Davison and R. L. Smith, whereby the parameters of the underlying
   generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) are treated as functions of
   covariates (i.e., traffic and meteorological factors). The new ModelII
   resolves the lack of threshold stability in the Davison-Smith model by
   constructing a special functional form for the GPD parameters. For each
   of the models, the effects of traffic and meteorological factors on the
   frequency and size of extreme values are estimated using Markov chain
   Monte Carlo methods. Finally, appropriate goodness-of-fit tests and
   model selection criteria confirm that ModelII significantly outperforms
   ModelI in estimation and forecasting of extremes.}},

Title = {{Temporal trends of PM10 and its impact on mortality in Lombardy, Italy}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{227}},
Pages = {{280-286}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Exposure to particulate matter with diameter <= 10 mu m
   (PM10) entails well documented adverse effects on human health. In the
   last decade, concentration of PM10 in Lombardy (10 million inhabitants),
   Italy, has been gradually decreasing. We evaluated how the mortality
   burden due to PM10. varied in that same period.
   Methods: We focused on 13 areas of the Region in 2003-2014: 11 cities
   with more than 50,000 inhabitants, 1 smaller alpine town and 1
   agricultural province. For each area, we collected PM10 annual average
   concentrations and natural mortality data, and we used the posterior
   area-specific effects from a previous Bayesian meta-analysis to estimate
   the short-term impact of PM10 on mortality, in terms of deaths
   attributable (AD) to annual average exposures exceeding the WHO
   threshold of 20 mu g/m(3).
   Results: PM10 annual average values showed a non-homogenous decreasing
   trend in the investigated time period in most of the areas. Overall, the
   population-weighted exposure levels decreased, except for a peak in
   2011, but never met the WHO threshold. In 2003-2006, PM10 levels were
   responsible, on average, for 343.0 annual AD from natural causes that
   decreased to 253.5 in 2007-2010 and to 208.3 in 2011-2014. Overall we
   estimated that PM10 was responsible for about 1\% of all natural deaths
   (min-max range: 0.86\%-1.42\%); the impact was heterogeneous among
   areas.
   Conclusions: By collecting routinely available data for the most
   populated areas in Lombardy, we returned a picture of air pollution and
   health trends in the last decade. Notwithstanding the observed reduction
   in PM10 between 2003 and 2014 and the resulting decline in the number of
   AD, the impact is still relevant. Hence, appropriate policies for
   emission reduction could have a further beneficial effect on population
   health. Studies based on routine data and local effect estimates are
   recommended to properly inform the policy-making process. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Atrazine (ATZ) is an herbicide most commonly used in China and other
   regions of the world. It is reported toxic to aquatic organisms, and
   frequently occurs at relatively high concentrations. Currently, ATZ has
   been proved to affect reproduction of aquatic species at much lower
   levels. So it is controversial to perform ecological risk assessment
   using predicted no-effect concentrations (PENCs) derived from
   traditional endpoints, which fail to provide adequate protection to
   aquatic organisms. In this study, PNECs of ATZ were derived based on six
   endpoints of survival, growth, behavior, biochemistry, genetics and
   reproduction. The PNEC derived from reproductive lesion was 0.044 mu g
   ATZ L-1, which was obviously lower than that derived from other
   endpoints. In addition, a tiered ecological risk assessment was
   conducted in the Taizi River based on six PNECs derived from six
   categories of toxicity endpoints. Results of these two methods of
   ecological risk assessment were consistent with each other, and the risk
   level of ATZ to aquatic organisms reached highest as taking reproductive
   fitness into account. The joint probability indicated that severe
   ecological risk rooting in reproduction might exist 93.9\% and 99.9\% of
   surface water in the Taizi River, while 5\% threshold (HC5) and 1\%
   threshold (HC1) were set up to protect aquatic organisms, respectively.
   We hope the present work could provide valuable information to manage

Title = {{A survey of topsoil arsenic and mercury concentrations across France}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{181}},
Pages = {{635-644}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Even at low concentrations, the presence of arsenic and mercury in soils
   can lead to ecological and health impacts. The recent European-wide
   LUCAS Topsoil Survey found that the arsenic concentration of a large
   proportion of French soils exceeded a threshold which indicated that
   further investigation was required. A much smaller proportion of soils
   exceeded the corresponding threshold for mercury but the impacts of
   mining and industrial activities on mercury concentrations are not well
   understood. We use samples from the French national soil monitoring
   network (RMQS: Reseau de Mesures de la Qualite des Sols) to explore the
   variation of topsoil arsenic and mercury concentrations across mainland
   France at a finer spatial resolution than was reported by LUCAS Topsoil.
   We use geostatistical methods to map the expected concentrations of
   these elements in the topsoil and the probabilities that the legislative
   thresholds are exceeded. We find that, with the exception of some areas
   where the geogenic concentrations and soil adsorption capacities are
   very low, arsenic concentrations are generally larger than the threshold
   which indicates that further assessment of the area is required. The
   lower of two other guideline values indicating risks to ecology or
   health is exceeded in fewer than 5\% of RMQS samples. These exceedances
   occur in localised hot-spots primarily associated with mining and
   mineralization. The probabilities of mercury concentrations exceeding
   the further assessment threshold value are everywhere less than 0.01 and
   none of the RMQS samples exceed either of the ecological and health risk
   thresholds. However, there are some regions with elevated concentrations
   which can be related to volcanic material, natural mineralizations and
   industrial contamination. These regions are more diffuse than the
   hot-spots of arsenic reflecting the greater volatility of mercury and
   therefore the greater ease with which it can be transported and
   redeposited. The maps provide a baseline against which future phases of
   the RMQS can be compared and highlight regions where the threat of soil
   contamination and its impacts should be more closely monitored. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{In this study, 31 workers at a university were randomly selected for
   indoor environmental monitoring in Wuhan. Two indicators, formaldehyde
   and total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), and using 139 monitoring
   points, monitored the indoor environment (including home and workplace)
   as well as the interior space of the main furniture. This study carried
   out the environmental quality assessment for TVOC based on the dB index
   method and the health risk assessment of indoor formaldehyde for the
   university staff receptors and, then focused on health risk in home
   environment to carry out detailed environmental health management. The
   results showed that TVOC in the three types of home spaces exceeded
   about 80\% of the national standard. The excessive formaldehyde ratios
   for kitchens (79\%), bedrooms (77\%) and living rooms (74\%) were
   calculated. Formaldehyde health risks all exceeded the United States
   Environmental Protection Agency, (USEPA) acceptable risk threshold. The
   formaldehyde concentrations in workplaces were about 0.03 mg.m(-3).
   While the risk contribution of the home environment to the total average
   health risk (0.0014, whether male and female) is about 96\%. For the
   adapted and unadapted persons, 90\% and 55\% of the monitoring points
   were located within the long-term tolerable range of TVOC decibel
   application, respectively. Long-term exposure to such an environment can
   lead to the Sick Building Syndrome (SBS). On the other hand, through
   comparison of the concentration of pollutants in the interior spaces of
   furniture and home spaces, it was determined tentatively that the
   pollutants were mainly concentrated in rarely used furniture. In
   summary, the air pollution in the studied homes of university staff was
   much serious than that in workplaces, which showed a need to manage TVOC
   and formaldehyde pollution by the three means: the purchase of green
   products, removal of internal pollution from furniture, and creating a
   good indoor volatile diffusion environment to create a healthy home

Abstract = {{Land use of sewage sludge is the primary disposal method in Shanxi,
   accounting for 42.66\% of all. To determine the ecological risk of heavy
   metals in sewage sludge, contents of seven heavy metals in sewage sludge
   from 9 municipal waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) that had the
   highest application for land use were determined. The order of the
   measured concentrations was: Zn > Cr > Cu > Ni > Pb > As > Cd, and all
   heavy metals contents were within the threshold limit values of the
   Chinese Control Standards for Pollutants in Sludge from Agriculture Use
   (GB4284-84). Four indices were used to assess the pollution and the
   ecological risk of heavy metals. By the mean values of the
   geoaccumulation index (I-geo), heavy metals were ranked in the following
   order: Cd > Zn > Cu > As > Cr > Ni > Pb. The values showed that the
   pollution of Zn in station 3 and Cd in station 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 were
   heavily; Cu in station 8 and 9, Zn in station 1, 2, 4, 8 and 9 and Cd in
   station 5 and 7 were moderately to heavily, and the accumulation of
   other heavy metals were not significant. The single-factor pollution
   index (PI) suggested that none of the stations had heavy metals
   contamination, except for Cu in station 9, Zn in station 3 and 8, and Cd
   in station 1 and 9, which were at a moderate level. According to the
   results of the Nemerow's synthetic pollution index (PN), sewage sludge
   from all stations was safe for land use with respect to heavy metals
   contamination, except for stations 3, 8 and 9, which were at the warning
   line. The monomial potential ecological risk coefficient (E-r(i))
   revealed that heavy metals ecological risks in most stations were low.
   However, station 9 had a moderate risk for Cu; station 6 had a moderate
   risk, stations 5 and 7 had high risk, other stations had very high risk
   for Cd. According to the results of the potential ecological risk index
   (RI), station 1, 8 and 9 had high risk; station 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 had a
   moderate risk, and station 6 had a low risk. The preliminary results
   indicated that the potential risk of land exposure to heavy metals in
   sewage sludge was relatively low, with Zn and Cd as the main contributor
   to the ecological risk for the applying of sewage sludge on land.
   Additionally, stations 3, 8 and 9 require more attention regarding the
   land applications related to heavy metals pollution.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Global biodiversity is undergoing rapid decline due to direct and
   indirect anthropogenic impacts to species and ecosystems. Marine
   species, in particular, are experiencing accelerated population declines
   leading to many species being considered at risk by regional, national,
   and international standards. As one conservation approach, decisions
   made using spatially explicit information on marine wildlife populations
   have the potential to facilitate recovery and contribute to national and
   international commitments toward conservation targets. Delineating areas
   of intense use by species at risk can inform future marine spatial
   planning and conservation efforts, including the identification of
   marine protected areas. Methods for detecting hotspots (e.g., areas with
   high density and/or abundance) enable categorical mapping of the most
   intensely used areas. Yet, many of the current methods for delineating
   hotspots, such as the top 5\% threshold, are subjective and fail to
   account for spatial patterns. Our goal was to map spatially continuous
   distributions of marine mammal densities and employ quantitative
   statistical methods to extract hotspot locations on the northern coast
   of British Columbia. We integrated systematically surveyed species
   information with environmental variables using generalized additive
   models to predict marine mammal distribution and density. Hotspots were
   identified from the density surfaces using two approaches: aspatial top
   5\% method and spatially local Gi{*} statistic using three neighborhood
   definitions. Heterogeneous density patterns were observed for all
   species, and high-density regions were generally clustered in areas
   exhibiting oceanographic characteristics that may promote concentrated
   food resources. Combining species density surfaces and extracting
   hotspot locations identified regions important to multiple species and
   present candidate locations for future conservation efforts.
   Contributions from this research provide robust statistical methods to
   objectively map hotspot locations and generate GIS data products for
   informing coastal conservation decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The anionic surfactant sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES) is the main
   component of most commercial products used for soil conditioning in the
   excavation industry, in particular as lubricants for mechanized
   tunnelling. Its use during the excavation processes can result in either
   the subsequent possible re-use of the huge amount of soil debris as
   by-products (e.g. land covering) or its discharge as waste. Currently,
   there are neither SLES soil threshold limits in European legislation,
   nor comprehensive studies on the environmental risk for soil ecosystems
   in these exposure scenarios.
   In this context, the present paper reviews the available data on the
   intrinsic characteristics of persistence and the ecotoxicological
   effects of the anionic surfactant SLES. Although SLES is generally
   reported to be biodegradable in standard tests, with degradation rates
   between 7 h and 30 days, depending on the initial conditions, data on
   its biodegradation in environmental studies are quite scarce.
   Consequently, assessing SLES biodegradation rates in field conditions is
   crucial for evaluating if in residual concentrations (typically in the
   range 40-500 mg/kg in excavated soils) it can or not be a potential
   hazard for terrestrial and water organisms. Laboratory ecotoxicological
   tests pointed out detrimental effects of SLES for aquatic organisms,
   while data on the terrestrial species are rather poor so far and further
   studies at the expected environmental concentrations are necessary.
   Finally, the review reports the main analytical methods available for
   detecting anionic surfactants in solid matrices and the future research

Abstract = {{Questions: How do community-weighted means of traits (CWM) and
   functional dispersion (FDis), a measure of trait variability, change in
   response to gradients of temperature, precipitation, soil nutrients and
   disturbance? Is the decrease in trait similarity between plots
   continuous or discontinuous? Is species turnover between plots linked to
   trait turnover?
   Location: Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, Africa.
   Methods: Sixty plots were established in 12 major vegetation types on
   Mount Kilimanjaro, covering large gradients of temperature,
   precipitation, soil nutrients and anthropogenic disturbance representing
   the dominant ecosystems in East Africa. Environmental data, plant
   abundances and plant traits were recorded for each plot. Trait CWM and
   FDis were related to environmental factors with partial least squares
   regressions. Trait similarity between pairs of plots was assessed with a
   null model approach.
   Results: Both CWM and FDis of most traits responded strongly to
   environmental factors, particularly to precipitation and disturbance.
   FDis of traits associated with growth and reproduction mostly increased
   with temperature and precipitation, and decreased with disturbance.
   Pair-wise plot comparisons revealed an inverse relationship of trait
   similarity with differences in temperature, precipitation and
   anthropogenic disturbance. However, changes in similarity were often
   discontinuous rather than continuous. Several vegetation types differed
   strongly in species composition but not in traits.
   Conclusions: Trait dispersion indicating functional niches increased
   with productivity and temperature. Conversely, low-productivity
   conditions were characterized by trait convergence. Discontinuous
   changes in trait similarity between plots suggested tipping points at
   which trait expressions change strongly to adjust to environmental
   conditions. Large sections of the temperature gradient were
   characterized by species turnover with only minor changes in traits,
   indicating that the functional composition may be resilient to gradual
   environmental changes until a tipping point is reached.}},

Title = {{Individual and Joint Effects of Early-Life Ambient PM2.5 Exposure and
   Maternal Prepregnancy Obesity on Childhood Overweight or Obesity}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Although previous studies suggest that exposure to
   traffic-related pollution during childhood increases the risk of
   childhood overweight or obesity (COWO), the role of early life exposure
   to line particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mu m; PM2.5) and
   its joint effect with the mother's prepregnancy body mass index (MPBMI)
   on COWO remain unclear.
   OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to examine the individual
   and joint effects of ambient PM2.5 exposures and MPBMI on the risk of
   COW.
   METHODS: We estimated exposures to ambient PM2.5 in utero and during the
   first 2 y of life (E2YL), using data from the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency's (EPA's) Air Quality System matched to residential
   address, in 1,446 mother infant pairs who were recruited at birth from
   1998 and followed up prospectively through 2012 at the Boston Medical
   Center in Massachusetts. We quantified the individual and joint effects
   of PM2.5 exposure with MPBMI on COWO, defined as the child's age- and
   sex-specific BMI z-score >85th percentile at the last well-child care
   visit between 2 and 9 y of age. Additivity was assessed by estimating
   the reduced excess risk due to interaction.
   RESULTS: Comparing the highest and lowest quartiles of PM2.5, the
   adjusted relative risks (RRs) {[}95\% confidence intervals (CIs)] of
   COWO were 1.3 (95\% CI: 1.1, 1.5), 1.2 (95\% CI: 1.0, 1.4), 1.2 (95\%
   CI: 1.0, 1.4), 1.3 (95\% CI: 1.1, 1.6), 1.3 (95\% CI: 1.1, 1.5) and 1.3
   (1.1, 1.5) during preconception; the first, second, and third
   trimesters; the entire period of pregnancy; and F2YL, respectively.
   Spline regression showed a dose response relationship between PM2.5
   levels and COWO after a threshold near the median exposure (10.46 mu
   g/m(3)-10.89 mu g/m(3)). Compared with their counterparts, children of
   obese mothers exposed to high levels of PM2.5 had the highest risk of
   COWO {[}RR >= 2.0, relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) not
   significant].
   CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we observed that early life exposure
   to PM2.5 may play an important role in the early life origins of COWO
   and may increase the risk of COWO in children of mothers who were
   overweight or obese before pregnancy beyond the risk that can be
   attributed to MPBMI alone. Our findings emphasize the clinical and
   public health policy relevance of early life PM2.5 exposure.}},

Abstract = {{In the economic activities related to combustible substances, it may

   the air humidity as an extra factor needed to be considered in relation

   present materials and experiments. For the third objective, a
   statistical method was implemented for the analysis in order to
   highlight the influence of air humidity on the ignition sensitivity of
   methane air mixtures. The statistical method was chosen because of
   stochastic character of the experimental output results. The main
   achievement of this work is the identified value for the threshold of

Abstract = {{Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are ubiquitous on tidal flats
   but their impact on sediment erosion has not been fully understood.
   Laboratory-controlled sediment beds were incubated with Bacillus
   subtilis for 5, 10, 16, and 22 days before the erosion experiments, to
   study the temporal and spatial variations in sediment stability caused
   by the bacterial secreted EPS. We found the biosedimentary systems
   showed different erosional behavior related to biofilm maturity and EPS
   distribution. In the first stage (5 days), the biosedimentary bed was
   more easily eroded than the clean sediment. With increasing growth
   period, bound EPS became more widely distributed over the vertical
   profile resulting in bed stabilization. After 22 days, the bound EPS was
   highly concentrated within a surface biofilm, but a relatively high
   content also extended to a depth of 5 mm and then decayed sharply with
   depth. The biofilm increased the critical shear stress of the bed and
   furthermore, it enabled the bed to withstand threshold conditions for an
   increased period of time as the biofilm degraded before eroding. After
   the loss of biofilm protection, the high EPS content in the sublayers
   continued to stabilize the sediment (hindered erosion) by binding
   individual grains, as visualized by electron microscopy. Consequently,
   the bed strength did not immediately revert to the abiotic condition but
   progressively adjusted, reflecting the depth profile of the EPS. Our
   experiments highlight the need to treat the EPS-sediment conditioning as
   a bed-age associated and depth-dependent variable that should be
   included in the next generation of sediment transport models.
   Plain Language Summary Sedimentology and geomorphology have
   traditionally been seen as fields in which physical and chemical
   processes dominate. However, microbial communities should never be
   bystanders, because they suffuse all sedimentary environments on earth.
   Under hydrodynamic forces, they take part in an impressive range of
   sediment processes and thus exercising a formative influence on coastal
   evolutions. Bio-sediments exhibit more complex characteristics than
   abiotic systems, and lead to different modelling methods compared to
   those in traditional settings. For instance, the thresholds for sediment
   initiation and subsequent erosion rates are no longer solely related to
   particle properties (e.g., particle size, the most widely used), but
   mediated by glue-like extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted
   by microbes. From this point of view, it is easy to understand why
   sediments in field observations behave differently from predictions,
   usually appearing considerably strengthened. Our results indicate that
   the EPS mediation in sediment stability may vary with the rhythms of
   microbial growth, and re-profile the sediment stability during different
   stages of cementing processes. A conceptual framework for sediment
   erosion is hence put forward to transform traditional sediment system to
   EPS-sediment system.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The paper is aimed at a methodological development of change-point
   detection, applicable in identifying abrupt changes in temporal or
   spatial data sequences. In earlier papers we developed a method for
   detecting a change in the parameters of a discrete distribution, with
   the simultaneous estimation of the (deterministic but unknown)
   distribution parameters before and after the change. In this paper we
   not only extend this method to the case of normal distributions, but
   also provide a new algorithm for the iterative refining of the
   estimation of the change-point, based on a ``cleaning{''} of mixed-up
   parts of the samples. The appropriate size of reduced part of the sample
   is analytically calculated for the case of normal distributions. This
   ``cleaning{''} is combined with our original change-point detection
   method. Our new algorithm is not only validated on artificial data, but
   also applied to a real environmental data set collected and analysed by
   other authors in a seafloor observatory. Our results detecting abrupt
   changes of bacterial mat coverage of a seafloor area are in harmony with
   the biological fluctuations and changes in the abiotic environment,
   analysed recently by other authors using a different method. We also
   provide a comparison with other existing change-point detection methods:
   a one-dimensional version of the gradient method widely used for edge
   detection, and a maximum type statistical method well-known in
   environmental studies. Although normality conditions of our method are
   rather restrictive, its application potential for environmental data
   sets is also demonstrated.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The oceans are changing more rapidly than ever before. Unprecedented
   climatic variability is interacting with unmistakable long-term trends,
   all against a backdrop of intensifying human activities. What remains
   unclear, however, is how to evaluate whether conditions have changed
   sufficiently to provoke major responses of species, habitats, and
   communities. We developed a framework based on multimodel inference to
   define ecosystem-based thresholds for human and environmental pressures
   in the California Current marine ecosystem. To demonstrate how to apply
   the framework, we explored two decades of data using gradient forest and
   generalized additive model analyses, screening for nonlinearities and
   potential threshold responses of ecosystem states (n = 9) across
   environmental (n = 6) and human (n = 10) pressures. These analyses
   identified the existence of threshold responses of five ecosystem states
   to four environmental and two human pressures. Both methods agreed on
   threshold relationships in two cases: (1) the winter copepod anomaly and
   habitat modification, and (2) sea lion pup production and the summer
   mode of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Considered collectively,
   however, these alternative analytical approaches imply that as many as
   five of the nine ecosystem states may exhibit threshold changes in
   response to negative PDO values in the summer (copepods, scavengers,
   groundfish, and marine mammals). This result is consistent with the idea
   that the influence of the PDO extends across multiple trophic levels,
   but extends current knowledge by defining the nonlinear nature of these
   responses. This research provides a new way to interpret changes in the
   intensities of human and environmental pressures as they relate to the
   ecological integrity of the California Current ecosystem. These insights
   can be used to make more informed assessments of when and under what
   conditions intervention, preparation, and mitigation may enhance
   progress toward ecosystem-based management goals.}},

Abstract = {{It is important to identify the non-stationarity in the relation between
   runoff and sediment load under the backdrop of the changing environment.
   This relation helps to further understand the mechanisms of runoff and
   sediment yield. A copula-based method was used to detect possible change
   points in the relation between runoff and sediment load in the Wei River
   Basin (WRB), China, where soil erosion is a very severe issue. The
   modified Mann-Kendall trend test method was applied to obtain the trends
   of runoff and sediment load spanning 1960-2010 at monthly and annual
   timescales. Finally, the causes of the identified non-stationarity of
   the relation between runoff and sediment load were roughly analyzed from
   the perspective of climate change and human activities. Results
   indicated that: (1) the runoff and sediment load in the Jinghe and Wei
   rivers were generally characterized by noticeably decreasing trends at
   both monthly and annual timescales; (2) both the Jinghe and Wei rivers
   had a common change point (2002), implying that the stationarity of the
   relation between runoff and sediment load in the Jinghe and Wei River
   was invalid; (3) human activities including increasing water consumption
   and growing application of soil conservation practices are dominant
   factors resulting in non-stationarity in the relation between runoff and

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{201}},

Abstract = {{In mining environmental applications, it is important to assess water
   quality from waste rock piles (WRPs) and estimate the likelihood of acid
   rock drainage (ARD) over time. The mineralogical heterogeneity of WRPs
   is a source of uncertainty in this assessment, undermining the
   reliability of traditional bulk indicators used in the industry. We
   focused in this work on the bulk neutralizing potential ratio (NPR),
   which is defined as the ratio of the content of non-acid-generating
   minerals (typically reactive carbonates such as calcite) to the content
   of potentially acid-generating minerals (typically sulfides such as
   pyrite). We used a streamtube-based Monte-Carlo method to show why and
   to what extent bulk NPR can be a poor indicator of ARD occurrence. We
   simulated ensembles of WRPs identical in their geometry and bulk NPR,
   which only differed in their initial distribution of the acid generating
   and acid neutralizing minerals that control NPR. All models simulated
   the same principal acid-producing, acid-neutralizing and secondary
   mineral forming processes. We show that small differences in the
   distribution of local NPR values or the number of flow paths that
   generate acidity strongly influence drainage pH. The results indicate
   that the likelihood of ARD (epitomized by the probability of occurrence
   of pH < 4 in a mixing boundary) within the first 100 years can be as
   high as 75\% for a NPR = 2 and 40\% for NPR = 4. The latter is
   traditionally considered as a ``universally safe{''} threshold to ensure
   non-acidic waters in practical applications. Our results suggest that
   new methods that explicitly account for mineralogical heterogeneity must
   be sought when computing effective (upscaled) NPR values at the scale of
   the piles.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Theory suggests that as ecological systems approach regime shifts,
   they become increasingly slow in recovering from perturbations. This
   phenomenon, known as critical slowing down {[}CSD], leads to spatial and
   temporal signatures in ecological state variables, thus potentially
   offering early indicators of regime shifts. Indicators using temporal
   dynamics have been empirically validated in laboratory microcosms and
   other well-mixed systems, but tests of spatial indicators of regime
   shifts at large spatial scales in the field are rare due to the relative
   absence of high-resolution data and difficulties in experimental
   manipulations. Here, we test theoretical predictions of CSD-based
   spatial indicators using large-scale field data from the Serengeti-Mara
   grassland-woodland system.
   Location: Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, Tanzania and Kenya.
   Time period: Year 2000
   Major taxa studied: Vegetation
   Method: We used a space-for-time substitution method to empirically test
   the validity of CSD-based spatial indicators, i.e., we computed
   indicators along a spatial {[}in lieu of temporal] gradient of
   ecological states. First we used a model of vegetation dynamics to
   determine if our space-for-time substitution method was appropriate.
   Then we tested for CSD-based spatial indicators using high-resolution
   spatial vegetation {[}30 m] and rainfall {[}2.5 km] data from the
   Serengeti-Mara ecosystem.
   Results: Our model predicts that CSD-based indicators increase along a
   spatial gradient of alternative vegetation states. Empirical analyses
   suggest that grasslands and woodlands occur as alternative stable states
   in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem with rainfall as one of the potential
   drivers of transitions between these states. We found that four indices
   of CSD showed the theoretically expected increasing trends along spatial
   gradients of grasslands to woodlands: spatial variance, spatial
   skewness, spatial correlation at lag-1 and spatial spectra at low
   frequencies.
   Main conclusions: Our results suggest that CSD-based spatial indicators
   can offer early warning signals of critical transitions in large-scale
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Research continues to show that pharmaceutical environmental

   public health risks associated with pharmaceuticals because in-home
   reserves of medications provide opportunities for accidental poisoning
   and intentional medication abuse. Pharmaceutical take back programs have
   been seen as a potential remedy for these issues; however, a thorough
   review of past programs indicates limited research has been conducted on
   take back programs. Furthermore, there are significant gaps in take back
   program research. To address these gaps and ultimately determine if take
   back programs could improve public health, research was conducted in
   conjunction with the take back program Denton drug disposal days held in
   Denton, Texas. Socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic
   characteristics of Denton drug disposal days participants were
   investigated using surveys and Geographic Information Systems. Potential
   impacts of the Denton drug disposal days program on public health were
   determined by comparing data from Denton drug disposal days events with
   data supplied by the North Texas Poison Center. Results suggest that
   Denton drug disposal days events may have prevented accidental
   poisonings or intentional abuse, however only qualitative comparisons
   support this statement and there was insufficient empirical evidence to
   support the conclusion that Denton drug disposal days events were
   exclusively responsible for public health improvements. An interesting
   finding was that there was a definitive travel threshold that influenced
   participation in Denton drug disposal days events. Overall, this study
   fills some geographic, socioeconomic, and demographic data gaps of take
   back programs and proposes methods to analyze and improve participation

   For practical reasons, artificial soils are commonly used as the control
   substrate. Interpretation of the test results compromised when the test
   soil and the artificial substrate differ in their physico-chemical
   properties other than just contaminants. In this study we identified the
   physico-chemical properties that influence avoidance response and
   evaluated the usefulness of adjusting these in the control substrate in
   order to isolate metal-driven avoidance of field soils by earthworms. A
   standardized two-section avoidance test with Eisenia fetida was
   performed on 52 uncontaminated and contaminated (Cu > 155 mg kg(-1), As
   > 19 mg kg(-1)) agricultural soils from the Aconcagua River basin and
   the Puchuncavi Valley in Chile. Regression analysis indicated that the
   avoidance response was determined by soil organic matter (OM),
   electrical conductivity (EC) and total soil Cu. Organic matter content
   of the artificial substrate was altered by peat additions and EC by NaCl
   so that these properties matched those of the field soils. The resultant
   EC80 for avoidance (indicative of soils of ``limited habitat{''}) was
   433 mg Cu kg(-1) (339 - 528 mg kg(-1) 95\% confidence intervals). The
   earthworm avoidance test can be used to assess metal toxicity in
   field-contaminated soils by adjusting physico-chemical properties (OM
   and EC) of the artificial control substrate in order to mimic those of
   the field-collected soil.}},

Abstract = {{Ammonia toxicity varies largely due to its pH- and temperature-dependent
   speciation (unionized ammonia nitrogen, NH3-N). The seasonal and
   long-term trend of ammonia risk in ecologically significant sections of
   Tai Lake, China was unknown. In this study, a two-level (deterministic
   and quantitative) method was developed to assess the special ecological
   risks posed by NH3-N at 37 sites during two seasons (February and
   September) of 2014 in Tai Lake. The long-term temporal (2004-2015) risk
   posed by NH3-N was also assessed by comparing annual quantitative risk
   values (probability of exceeding acute or chronic threshold values) in
   three key sections of Tai Lake. The results indicated the species living
   in the Tai Lake were at a 0.04\% and 32.45\% chance of risk due to acute
   exposure, and a 1.97\% and 92.05\% chance of risk due to chronic
   exposure in February and September of 2014, respectively. Alarmingly,
   the chronic ecological risks of NH3-N in the Lanshanzui section of the
   Tai Lake remained > 30\% from 2004 to 2011. The chronic risk of NH3-N in
   all three key sections of Tai Lake started to decrease in 2011. This was
   likely the consequence of the control practice of eutrophication
   implemented in the Tai Lake. A significant decline in diversity of the
   benthic invertebrate community of the Tai Lake could be associated with
   continuous exposure to ammonia over decades given different sensitivity
   of taxa to ammonia. The results laid a scientific foundation for risk
   assessment and management of ammonia in Tai Lake, China, and the
   developed two-level risk assessment approach can also be applied to
   other similar aquatic regions.}},

Journal = {{MOVEMENT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Continuous time movement models resolve many of the problems
   with scaling, sampling, and interpretation that affect discrete movement
   models. They can, however, be challenging to estimate, have been
   presented in inconsistent ways, and are not widely used.
   Methods: We review the literature on integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
   velocity models and propose four fundamental correlated velocity
   movement models (CVM's): random, advective, rotational, and
   rotational-advective. The models are defined in terms of biologically
   meaningful speeds and time scales of autocorrelation. We summarize
   several approaches to estimating the models, and apply these tools for
   the higher order task of behavioral partitioning via change point
   analysis.
   Results: An array of simulation illustrate the precision and accuracy of
   the estimation tools. An analysis of a swimming track of a bowhead whale
   (Balaena mysticetus) illustrates their robustness to irregular and
   sparse sampling and identifies switches between slower and faster, and
   directed vs. random movements. An analysis of a short flight of a lesser
   kestrel (Falco naumanni) identifies exact moments when switches occur
   between loopy, thermal soaring and directed flapping or gliding flights.
   Conclusions: We provide tools to estimate parameters and perform change
   point analyses in continuous time movement models as an R package
   (smoove). These resources, together with the synthesis, should
   facilitate the wider application and development of correlated velocity
   models among movement ecologists.}},

   Spatial ANP}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Cities are exploding, occupying rural territory in dispersed and
   fragmented ways. A consequence of this phenomenon is that the demand for
   utilities includes more and more extensive territories. Among them,
   fulfilling the demand for services related to integrated water service
   presents many difficulties. The economic costs needed to meet service
   demand and the environmental costs associated with its non-fulfilment
   are inversely proportional to the population needing service in rural
   areas, since that population is distributed across a low-density
   gradient. Infrastructure planning, within the area of competence,
   generally follows a policy of economic sustainability, fixing a service
   coverage threshold in terms of a ``sufficient{''} concentration of
   population and economic activity (91/271/CEE). This threshold,
   homogenous within the territorial limits of a water infrastructure plan,
   creates uncertainty in the planning of investments, which are not sized
   on the actual, appropriately spatialized, demand for service. Careful
   prediction of the location of infrastructure investments would guarantee
   not only economic savings but also reduce the environmental costs
   generated by the lack of utilities. Therefore, is necessary to create a
   link between water infrastructure planning and urban planning, which is
   responsible for the future spatial distribution of service demand. In
   this study, the relationships between the instruments of regulation and
   planning are compared by a multi-criteria spatial analysis network
   (analytic network process (ANP)). This method, tested on a sample of a
   city in southern Italy, allows us to optimize the design and location of
   the investment needed to meet the service criteria, looking at the
   actual efficiency of the networks. The result of this application is a
   suitability map that allows us to validate the criteria for defining
   urban transformations.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Indicators of pending state-shifts carry value for policy makers.
   Predator-prey relations reflect key ecological processes that shape
   ecosystems. Variance in predator-prey relations may serve as a key
   indicator of future state-shifts.
   Methods Lion (Panthera leo) diet in the Kruger National Park was
   evaluated as such an indicator. Over the three-decade time span
   reviewed, variance in diet in relation to rainfall, prey abundance,
   management strategies and disease emergence were reviewed.
   Key results Rainfall patterns, both seasonal and cyclical, were
   identified as key drivers of predator-prey selection. However, the
   intensity of management in the form of artificial waterpoints overrode
   and confounded natural process. The results suggest that savanna systems
   are stable and punctuated by climatic events in the form of extreme
   above-average rainfall that temporarily destabilises the system.
   However, droughts are a cyclical part of the savanna system.
   Conclusion Lion prey selection did fluctuate with changing environmental
   conditions. Abrupt state shifts did occur; however, the ecosystem
   returned to a stable state.
   Implications State shifts in ecosystems pose key challenges to
   conservation managers. State shifts appear to be primarily associated

Abstract = {{To estimate the ecological risk of toxic organic pollutant
   (formaldehyde) and heavy metals (mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), cadmium
   (Cd), and chromium (Cr)) in water and sediment from a landscape Lake in
   Tianjin City, an ecological risk assessment was performed. The risk
   quotient (RQ) method and the AQUATOX model were used to assess the
   ecological risk of formaldehyde in landscape water. Meanwhile, the RQ
   method and the potential ecological risk index method were used to
   assess the ecological risk of four heavy metals in water and sediment
   from the studied landscape lake, respectively. The results revealed that
   the maximum concentration of formaldehyde in landscape water was lower
   than the environmental quality standards of surface water in China. The
   maximum simulated concentrations of formaldehyde in phytoplankton and
   invertebrates were 3.15 and 22.91 mu g/L, respectively, which were far
   less than its toxicity data values (1000 and 510 mu g/L, respectively),
   suggesting that formaldehyde in landscape water was at a safe level for
   aquatic organisms. The RQ model indicated that the risks of
   phytoplankton and invertebrates were higher than that of fish posed by
   Hg and Cd in landscape water, and the risks from As and Cr were
   acceptable for all test organisms. Cd is the most important pollution
   factor among all heavy metals in sediment from studied landscape lake,
   and the pollution factor sequence of heavy metals was Hg > As > Cr > Cd.
   The values of risk index (RI) for four heavy metals in samples a and b
   were 43.48 and 72.66, which were much lower than the threshold value
   (150), suggesting that the ecological risk posed by heavy metals in

Abstract = {{Question: When did vegetation assemblages that occupy modern central
   Mexico appear within the context of the late Quaternary?
   Location: Central Mexico.
   Methods: We used modern and fossil pollen data sets from central Mexico
   to explore the evolution of regional vegetation through the late
   Quaternary. A total of 1397 samples (1357 fossil samples distributed in
   17 records and 40 modern samples) were analysed through detrended
   correspondence analysis to evaluate the degree of analogy between modern
   and past vegetation assemblages, and regional vegetation compositional
   turnover through time.
   Results: There was a high degree of analogy between modern and glacial
   vegetation, whereas the early and mid-Holocene were characterized by a
   high frequency of no-modern-analogue pollen assemblages. Vegetation
   turnover during the glacial time was characterized by both pulses of
   abrupt change and episodes of stability. In contrast, vegetation
   turnover was high through most of the Holocene. Both vegetation turnover
   and past vegetation analogy to modern were not synchronous in
   altitudinal zones, except for the past 2000yrs, when pollen assemblages
   suggest a high vegetation analogy to modern-day throughout the region.
   Conclusions: Human impacts on central Mexico regional vegetation were
   consistently evident during the last 2000yrs, suggesting that
   biodiversity expressed in the modern vegetation assemblages incorporates
   a high anthropogenic imprint. High resemblance of glacial and modern
   landscapes suggests that the effect of human occupation on the landscape
   is similar to that exerted by glacial time environmental stress.
   However, loss of ecosystem connectivity under the modern pattern of
   landscape homogenization represents an unprecedented threat for regional

Abstract = {{Context Increasing human populations in urban areas pose a threat to
   species' persistence through habitat loss and fragmentation. It is
   therefore essential that we develop methods to investigate critical
   habitat loss thresholds and least detrimental landscape configurations.
   Objectives We develop a framework to assess how the pattern of habitat
   loss impacts the ecological and social characteristics of a landscape
   and how this varies depending on the species and criteria by which it is
   judged.
   Methods We use a scenario-based approach to test six propositions in
   which habitat is lost preferentially based on patch characteristics. We
   use eight bird and two amphibian species as indicator species. To
   compare scenarios, we present a method combining the output from a
   metapopulation model with measures of social impacts of land-cover
   change in a multiple criteria decision analysis. We also determine
   whether a habitat loss threshold exists, below which small loss of
   habitat can lead to large loss of species' occupancy.
   Results We found that, of the scenarios presented, preferentially losing
   common habitats and smaller patches was least detrimental for both
   ecological and social factors. Threshold effects were found for all but
   the generalist bird species.
   Conclusions We have outlined a workflow which allows for transparent,
   repeatable comparison between landscapes. This workflow can be used to
   compare urban landscape plans, or to develop general understanding of

Abstract = {{Surveying plant diversity in arid desert areas is extremely difficult
   because of the harsh climate, hostile terrain, lack of roads, and
   insecurity, which is why it is particularly important to improve the
   sampling efficiency, but few relevant studies have been done. The
   performance of non-parametric estimators was assessed with first-hand
   field data to determine (a) the threshold of the proportion of uniques
   (number of species that occur in exactly one plot divided by the number
   of species sampled) that involves the least sampling effort and (b) the
   method of locating plots to obtain a more reliable estimate of species
   richness. The study area (Gurbantunggut desert, China) was divided into
   five sub-regions based on variation in physical environment and
   vegetation. The following common correction factors were selected: ACE,
   Chao1, Bootstrap, Chao2, ICE, Jack1, and Jack2. The estimates for each
   sub-region (partition) and for the entire region (without partition),
   the threshold of proportion of uniques, and the method of determining
   sampling locations (including prior sampling of plots that show large
   differences in habitats) were compared in terms of their ability to
   predict the number of species more accurately. We found that ACE and
   Chao1 (which use abundance data) showed more biased estimates than the
   other factors (incidence data), and best estimator is Jack1. Species
   richness was significantly underestimated for the region, but the
   non-parametric estimators could estimate the species richness for each
   sub-region reliably. Sampling locations affected the performance of
   non-parametric estimators significantly. The threshold of minimum
   sampling was 15\% and that of uniques was 30\%; the two were able to
   limit the bias within 5 and 10\%, respectively. It is concluded that the
   non-parametric estimators can estimate the plant diversity of arid
   deserts reliably from the data on incidence. The study area (on the
   scale of a region) should be partitioned to improve the performance of
   the non-parametric estimators. The plots with larger differences in
   habitats should be sampled more extensively based on the threshold of
   the proportion of uniques.}},

   wastewater up to ca. 1 mu g L-1 Concentrations in raw wastewater were
   converted into levels of exposure to six phthalate diesters. For two of
   them, these levels were always below the daily exposure thresholds
   recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European
   Food Safety Authority. For the other four, however, estimates of
   exposure surpassed such a threshold (especially the toddler threshold)
   in some cases, highlighting the significance of the exposure to
   phthalates in children. Finally, concentrations in wastewater were also
   used to estimate metabolite concentrations in urine, providing a
   reasonable concordance between our results and the data obtained in two
   previous biomonitoring studies.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, the number of people living in an urban environment exceeds
   the rural population with increasing tendency. Especially in relation to
   global climate change, cities play a major role considering the impacts
   of extreme heat waves on the population. For urban planners, it is
   important to know which types of urban structures are beneficial for a
   comfortable urban climate and which actions can be taken to improve
   urban climate conditions. Therefore, it is essential to differ between
   not only urban and rural environments, but also between different levels
   of urban densification. To compare these built-up types within different
   cities worldwide, Stewart and Oke developed the concept of local climate
   zones (LCZ) defined by morphological characteristics. The original LCZ
   scheme often has considerable problems when adapted to European cities
   with historical city centers, including narrow streets and irregular
   patterns. In this study, a method to bridge the gap between a classical
   land use/land cover (LULC) classification and the LCZ scheme is
   presented. Multitemporal Landsat 8 data are used to create a high
   accuracy LULC map, which is linked to the LCZ by morphological
   parameters derived from a high-resolution digital surface model and
   cadastral data. A bijective combination of the different classification
   schemes could not be achieved completely due to overlapping threshold
   values and the spatially homogeneous distribution of morphological
   parameters, but the attribution of LCZ to the LULC classification was
   successful. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons

Abstract = {{Soil contamination caused by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) released from
   sewage treatment plants (STPs) is of great public concern. Understanding
   the relationships between the physicochemical properties of AgNPs and
   their toxicity is critical for environmental and health risk analysis.
   Here we presented an approach for rapidly screening and assessing the
   potential toxicity risk of AgNPs in general and sludge-treated soils
   based on the nematode Caenhorhabditis elegans-based probabilistic risk
   assessment framework. The soil environmental risks were estimated
   depending on the characteristics of AgNPs and geographic regions. We
   assessed the risk for soils exceeding a threshold of C. elegans
   neurotoxicity based on the statistical models. Our results indicated
   that locomotion inhibition of C. elegans was depending on surface
   properties, diameter, and exposure time of AgNPs. Here we showed that
   the overall sewage sludge-released AgNPs-associated soil contamination
   risk was very low among Europe, U.S., and Switzerland. However, large
   production and widespread use of AgNPs are highly likely to pose
   long-term ecotoxicity risk on general and sludge-treated soils,
   particularly for 26 nm citrate-coated AgNPs. Our approach of integrating
   probabilistic risk model and C. elegans-based ecological indicator
   provides an effective tool to rapidly screen and assess the impacts of
   STPs-released AgNPs on soil environment. We suggest that C. elegans as a
   proxy for estimating soil risk metrics can help develop methods of
   management for mitigating the metal NPs-induced toxicity on terrestrial

Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{557-570}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The use of high levels of thermal insulation is a common
   practice towards reducing the energy consumption of the existing
   building stock; however, the embodied burdens associated with the
   additional insulation material are usually not taken into account and
   questions regarding the risks of over-specifying the insulation levels
   have been emerging, particularly for mild climate regions. This article
   addresses the issue presenting an integrated approach that combines life
   cycle assessment and thermal dynamic simulation to assess alternative
   retrofit strategies for the roof and exterior walls of two dwellings
   (from the beginning of the twentieth century), in the historic city
   center of Coimbra, Portugal. A comprehensive analysis of alternative
   insulation thicknesses (no insulation, 40, 80, and 120 mm of expanded
   polystyrene) was made to identify optimal thickness levels minimizing
   life cycle (LC) environmental impacts for a single-family house and an
   apartment.
   Methods Embodied and operational impact trade-offs were calculated for
   six impact categories: climate change, ozone depletion, terrestrial
   acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, and
   non-renewable primary energy. The operational energy was calculated
   using a dynamic thermal modeling software (EnergyPlus). The functional
   unit selected for this study was 1 m(2) of living area over a period of
   50 years.
   Results and discussion The single-family house embodied impacts account
   for 26-57 \% of total LC impacts. For insulation thicknesses larger than
   80 mm, the embodied impacts are greater than operational impacts. For
   the apartment, embodied impacts account for 25-49 \% of total LC
   impacts. The environmental benefits of additional insulation are very
   low (<3 \%) for thicknesses of more than 80 mm for both roof and
   exterior walls. For thicknesses above the tipping point (where total LC
   impacts are minimized), the marginal impacts of additional insulation
   are higher than the benefits. The results for the apartment show that
   optimal insulation thicknesses (LC tipping point) range from 30 to 40 mm
   for the roof and from 60 to 80 mm for the exterior walls. The LC tipping
   point for the single-family house is achieved by combining 80-100 mm of
   roof insulation with 60-80 mm of exterior wall insulation.
   Conclusions Extra insulation levels in temperate climates can lead to
   higher embodied impacts, without significant reduction in operational
   impacts, which can result in higher total LC impacts. The results show
   that a tipping point can be identified, and recommendations are provided
   for the roof and exterior wall retrofits of buildings from the beginning
   of the twentieth century.}},

Abstract = {{Context Recent conceptual developments in ecosystem services research
   have revealed the need to elucidate the complex and unintended
   relationships between humans and the environment if we are to better
   understand and manage ecosystem services in practice.
   Objectives This study aimed to develop a model that spatially represents
   a complex human-environment (H-E) system consisting of heterogeneous
   social-ecological components and feedback mechanisms at multiple scales,
   in order to assess multi-dimensional (spatial, temporal, and social)
   trade-offs in ecosystem services.
   Methods We constructed an agent-based model and empirically calibrated
   it for a semi-arid region in Northeast China, and examined ecosystem
   service trade-offs derived from the Sloping Land Conversion Program
   (SLCP), which is based on payment for ecosystem services. This paper
   describes our model, named Inner Mongolia Land Use Dynamic Simulator
   (IM-LUDAS), using the overview, design concepts, and details + decision
   (ODD + D) protocol and demonstrates the capabilities of IM-LUDAS through
   simulations.
   Results IM-LUDAS represented typical characteristics of complex H-E
   systems, such as secondary and cross-scale feedback loops, time lags,
   and threshold change, revealing the following results: tree plantations
   expanded by the SLCP facilitated vegetation and soil restoration and
   household change toward off-farm livelihoods, as expected by the
   government; conversely, the program caused further land degradation
   outside the implementation plots; moreover, the livelihood changes were
   not large enough to compensate for income deterioration by
   policy-induced reduction in cropland.
   Conclusions IM-LUDAS proved itself to be an advanced empirical model
   that can recreate essential features of complex H-E systems and assess
   multi-dimensional trade-offs in ecosystem services.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{A recurring goal in ecological and paleoclimatic studies is to either
   forecast how ecosystems will respond to future climate or hindcast
   climate from past ecosystem assemblages. The Pliocene is a useful
   deep-time laboratory for understanding an equilibrium climate state
   under modern atmospheric CO2, and has been a focus for climate modelers.
   Accurate estimates of proxy data-model mismatch are hindered by the
   scarcity of well-constrained observations from well-dated sites in the
   High Arctic. Using a recently developed community-based approach
   (Climate Reconstruction Analysis using Coexistence Likelihood
   Estimation: CRACLE) compared with an established method (The Coexistence
   Approach: CA), and applied to extraordinary, permafrost-driven
   preservation of floras, we explore the climate and community assemblages
   at five Pliocene sites in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The results
   suggest that climatic differences at this scale do not simply correlate
   to differences in community assemblage between sites. The threshold
   temperature for tree line is one important component, but other factors
   in the environment (e.g., soil characteristics) may drive dissimilarity
   of communities where the taxa could share the same climate space.
   Estimates from CRACLE agree with previous estimates where available, and
   generally fall within the ranges of CA. Mean annual temperatures were
   similar to 22 degrees C hotter (ranging from 0.8 to 6.2 degrees C by
   species across sites) and mean annual precipitation similar to 500 mm
   wetter (ranging from 530 to 860 mm by species across sites) during the
   Early to ``mid{''}-Pliocene (similar to 3.6 Ma) when compared with
   modern climate station data in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.
   Comparison of estimates for three levels of taxonomic input suggest
   judicious interpretation is needed when generic level identifications
   are used, especially in the Polar Regions. The results herein are a
   reminder of the large impact of non-climatic abiotic and biotic factors
   to be accounted for when predicting future ranges of communities under
   different climate conditions from the present, and when hindcasting
   climate from past ecosystem assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{This paper adopts the slacks-based measure-directional distance function

   28 manufacturing industries in China. The results indicate that the
   overall level of green innovation growth in China's manufacturing is
   relatively low, with a declining trend. The tradeoffs among energy,
   environment and economy are rather sharp, and the Porter Effect (1995)
   (environmental regulation will promote green technology innovation) is
   not currently realized quickly in manufacturing. These evaluations imply
   an unsustainable development model in China, with significant

   that external knowledge sourcing has a significant negative impact on

   surpassing critical mass, the negative role of external knowledge
   sourcing in driving this mechanism becomes smaller and smaller; it has a

Abstract = {{Understanding the relationships between ecosystem services is important
   for promoting ecosystem service management and sustainable development.
   The relationships between ecosystem services have commonly been
   characterized as tradeoffs and synergies. Here, we report that a third
   type of relationship also exists, in which one ecosystem service
   constrains the other. Selecting the grassland and agropastoral
   transitional zone of North China (GAPTZ) as the study area, we examined
   the relationships between paired ecosystem services: net primary
   productivity (NPP), soil conservation (SC), soil erosion by wind (SL),
   water yield (WY), and water retention (WR). The constraint effect of one
   ecosystem service on the other was determined by extracting the upper
   constraint lines from the scatter plots of the paired ecosystem services
   with segmented quantile regression on the levels of landscape, class,
   and ecoregion. Our results revealed eight types of constraint effects
   between the ten paired ecosystem services: (1) positive linear, (2)
   negative linear, (3) logarithmic, (4) negative convex, (5) backward
   S-shaped, (6) hump shaped, (7) convex-waved, and.(8) concave-waved. At
   the landscape, class, and ecoregion levels, there was a hump-shaped
   constraint effect between NPP and SC. Precipitation was the main factor
   shaping the constraint line of the paired NPP-SC. The gradually
   increasing constraint effect of higher NPP on WY indicated that, in arid
   and semiarid areas, improving NPP decreases water yield. In farmland
   areas, the backward S-shaped constraint line of the paired NPP-SL
   indicates that crops, unlike forests and grasslands, could not protect
   soil from wind erosion. The constraint effects of SL on WY and WR are
   negative convex on the landscape level and convex-waved or concave-waved
   on the class and ecoregion levels. The constraint line approach enriches
   the understanding of linkages between ecosystem services and the
   potential drivers. The constraint effects of ecosystem services have
   important implications for sustainable land use planning to optimize

Title = {{Are Limits of Concern a useful concept to improve the environmental risk
   assessment of GM plants?}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{29}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has introduced a
   concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified
   (GM) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values
   defining acceptable adverse effects of the GM plant on the environment
   (Limits of Concern, LoC).
   Methods: We analysed the LoC concept by scrutinising its feasibility
   with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment.
   We then considered its relationship with protection goals, the
   comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. We
   finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects,
   effects on nontarget organisms and species of conservation concern.
   Results: The LoC concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological
   thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate
   environmental harm. However, the concept leaves many important aspects
   open. Thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need
   spatial and temporal differentiation from LoCs used for ERA indicators.
   Regionalisation of LoCs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and
   protection goals vary across the EU. Further guidance is needed with
   respect to the consequences, in case LoCs are exceeded and a link needs
   to be established between environmentally relevant results from the
   comparative safety assessment and the LoC concept. LoCs for long-term
   effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. LoCs for
   non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species
   and parameters assessed.
   Conclusions: The overall LoC concept is considered useful if LoCs are
   further specified and differentiated. Although LoCs will finally be
   determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific
   grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety
   of GM plants.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated environmental pressures negatively affect the bacterial

   responses of spatially related environmental variable across multiple
   plateau lake ecosystems on bacterioplankton communities has been
   gathered. Here, we used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes to study
   the associations of bacterial communities in terms of environmental
   characteristics as well as the potentially ecological threshold-inducing
   shifts of the bacterial community structure along the key environmental
   variables based on hypothesized structural equation models and the
   SEGMENTED method in 21 plateau lakes. Our results showed that water
   transparency was the major driving force and that total nitrogen was
   more significant than total phosphorus in determining the taxon
   composition of the bacterioplankton community. Significant community
   threshold estimates for bacterioplanlcton were observed at 736 for pH
   and 25.6\% for the percentage of the agricultural area, while the
   remarkable change point of the cyanobacreria community structure

Abstract = {{Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) form an important group
   of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) affecting troposphere and posing
   risk to human health. The article examines the Mazeikiai area in the
   northern part of Lithuania where one of the largest Central European
   companies and the only oil refinery in the Baltic region (200,000
   barrels/day) are close to the Baltic Sea. The research carried out
   mainly focuses on the following objectives: quantitative assessment of
   the amounts of BTEX occurring in the impact zone of the oil refinery and
   transport; estimation of background BTEX concentrations in the region;
   establishing the main sources of BTEX in the region researched and
   evaluation of impact of meteorological parameters on BTEX concentrations
   in different seasons. The passive measurement method was used for
   analysing VOCs (benzene (C6H6), toluene (C7H8), ethylbenzene (C8H10) and
   ortho-, meta-para-xylene (C8H10)). The research was carried out in
   2010-2012. Its results showed that the average annual concentration of
   benzene was below the threshold value of 5 mu g/m(3). Within the
   measurement period, the average concentration of benzene fluctuated from
   1.2 to 2.4 mu g/m(3), that of toluene varied from 1.3 to 3.5 mu g/m(3),
   that of ethylbenzene varied from 0.3 to 0.7 mu g/m(3) and that of xylene
   (calculated as para-, meta-and ortho-xylene) varied from 1.0 to 2.4 mu
   g/m(3). Compared to the established BTEX concentration, the actual
   background BTEX concentration in the urban area is two times higher. The
   seasonal analysis suggests that the highest values of benzene
   concentration are observed in the winter season.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of non-methane organic gases (NMOG) emissions
   according to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
   regulations is currently a multi-step process requiring separate
   measurement of various emissions components by a number of independent
   on-line and off-line techniques. The Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) method described in this paper records all required
   components using a single instrument. It gives data consistent with the
   regulatory method, greatly simplifies the process, and provides second
   by second time resolution. Non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) are measured
   by identifying a group of hydrocarbons, including oxygenated species,
   that serve as a surrogate for this class, the members of which are
   dynamically included if they are present in the exhaust above
   predetermined threshold levels. This yields an FTIR equivalent measure
   of NMHC that correlates within 5\% to the regulatory flame ionization
   detection (FID) method. NMOG is then determined per regulatory
   calculation solely from FTIR recorded emissions of NMHC, ethanol,
   acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde, yielding emission rates that also
   correlate within 5\% with the reference method. Examples are presented
   to show how the resulting time resolved data benefit aftertreatment

Abstract = {{During the National Geochemical Survey of Australia over 1300 top (0-10
   cm depth) and bottom (similar to 60-80 cm depth) sediment samples
   (including similar to 10\% field duplicates) were collected from the
   outlet of 1186 catchments covering 81\% of the continent at an average
   sample density of 1 site/5200 km(2). The <2 mm fraction of these samples
   was analysed for 59 elements by ICP-MS following an aqua regia
   digestion. Results are used here to establish the geochemical background
   variation of these elements, including potentially toxic elements
   (PTEs), in Australian surface soil. Different methods of obtaining
   geochemical threshold values, which differentiate between background and
   those samples with unusually high element concentrations and requiring
   attention, are presented and compared to Western Australia's `ecological
   investigation levels' (Els) established for 14 PTEs. For Mn and V these
   ElIs are so low that an unrealistically large proportion (similar to
   24\%) of the sampled sites would need investigation in Australia. For
   the 12 remaining elements (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sn
   and Zn) few sample sites require investigation and as most of these are
   located far from human activity centres, they potentially suggest either
   minor local contamination or mineral exploration potential rather than
   pollution. No major diffuse source of contamination by PTEs affects
   Australian soil at the continental scale. Of the statistical methods
   used to establish geochemical threshold values, the most pertinent
   results come from identifying breaks in cumulative probability
   distributions, the Tukey inner fence and the 98th percentile.
   Geochemical threshold values for 59 elements, including emerging
   `high-tech' critical elements such as lanthanides, Be, Ga or Ge, for

Title = {{What are the impacts of flow regime changes on fish productivity in
   temperate regions? A systematic map protocol}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Ecosystem changes from altered flows can have multiple
   impacts on fish, including changes to physical habitat, habitat access,
   food supplies, behaviour, community composition, energy expenditure, and
   population dynamics. There is growing evidence of the potential negative
   consequences of altered flow regimes on fluvial ecosystems and the
   fisheries they support. As such, the scientific and policy communities
   have acknowledged the need for maintaining or restoring natural flow
   variability in order to sustain ecological health of fluvial ecosystems.
   However, for resource managers, making decisions on the potential
   effects of flow alterations on fish productivity has been problematic
   because there are still uncertainties regarding flow-fish productivity
   relationships. Therefore, to ensure the maintenance of healthy and
   productive aquatic ecosystems and the sustainability of riverine
   fisheries, a better understanding of the impacts of flow alteration on
   fish productivity is needed. Due to the wide scope of this review, and
   the diversity of fish productivity outcomes used to evaluate flow
   alteration impacts, the set of studies will be quite heterogeneous.
   Therefore, prior to undertaking a comprehensive and quantitative
   synthesis, we propose to begin with a systematic map to provide an
   overview of the available evidence on the impacts of flow regime changes
   on fish productivity. We will also use this systematic map to identify
   subtopics that are sufficiently covered by existing studies to allow
   full systematic reviewing.
   Methods: This systematic map will compile evidence on the impacts of
   flow regime changes on fish productivity. All studies that evaluate the
   effects of flow regime change on direct outcomes of fish productivity,
   will be included in the review. We will use a broad definition of fish
   productivity to include any measurement related to: biomass, abundance,
   density, yield, diversity, growth, survival, individual performance,
   migration, reproduction, recruitment, or surrogate thereof. Relevant
   causes of a change in/modification to flow regime can include: (1)
   anthropogenic causes: dams, reservoirs (impoundments), hydroelectric
   facilities, locks, levees, water withdrawal (abstraction), water
   diversion, land-use changes, and road culverts; or (2) natural causes:
   climate change (possible indirect anthropogenic cause as well), floods,
   droughts, seasonal changes. Any freshwater or estuarine fish species or
   species groups in temperate regions will be considered. The review will
   include a wide range of sources including primary and grey literature
   and use public databases, search engines and specialist websites. A
   searchable database containing extracted metadata from relevant included
   studies will be developed and provided as a supplementary file to the
   map report. The final narrative will describe the quantity and key
   characteristics of the available evidence, identify knowledge gaps for
   future research and identify subtopics that are sufficiently covered by
   existing studies to allow full systematic reviewing.}},

Title = {{The physiological strain incurred during electrical utilities work over
   consecutive work shifts in hot environments: A case report}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{986-994}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: In this article, we evaluated physiological strain in
   electrical utilities workers during consecutive work shifts in hot
   outdoor conditions.
   Methods: Four highly experienced electrical utilities workers were
   monitored during regularly scheduled-work performed in hot conditions
   (similar to 34 degrees C) on two consecutive days. Worker hydration
   (urine specific gravity) was assessed prior to and following work. The
   level of physical exertion was determined by video analysis. Body core
   temperature (T-core) and heart rate (HR; presented as a percentage of
   maximum, \% HRmax) were monitored continuously. Responses were reported
   for each worker individually and as a group mean +/- standard deviation.
   Results: According to current guidelines, all workers were dehydrated
   prior to work on both days (urine specific gravity: day 1, 1.025 +/-
   0.005; day 2, 1.029 +/- 0.004) and remained dehydrated following work
   (urine specific gravity: day 1, 1.027 +/- 0.015; day 2, 1.032 +/- 0.004)
   except for one worker on day 1 (urine specific gravity of 1.005). On day
   1, the proportion of the work shift spent at rest (as defined by the
   American Conference for Governmental and Industrial Hygienists, ACGIH)
   was 51 +/- 15\% (range: 30-64\%). Time spent resting increased in all
   workers on the second day reaching 66 +/- 5\% (range: 60-71\%) of the
   work shift. Work shift average T-core was 37.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C (range:
   37.5-37.7 degrees C) and 37.7 +/- 0.2 degrees C (range: 37.5-37.9
   degrees C) on days 1 and 2, respectively. Peak T-core surpassed the
   ACGIH recommended threshold limit of 38.0 degrees C for work in the heat
   in three workers on day 1 (38.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C, range: 37.8-38.2
   degrees C) while all workers exceeded this threshold on day 2 (38.4 +/-
   0.2 degrees C, range: 38.2-38.7 degrees C). By contrast, work shift
   average (day 1, 67 +/- 7\% HRmax, range: 59-74\% HRmax; day 2, 65 +/-
   4\% HRmax, range: 60-70\% HRmax) and peak (day 1, 90 +/- 6\% HRmax,
   range: 83-98\% HRmax; day 2, 87 +/- 10\% HRmax, range: 73-97\% HRmax) HR
   were similar between days.
   Conclusion: This case report demonstrates elevations in thermal strain
   over consecutive work shifts despite decreases in work effort in
   electrical utilities workers during regular work in the heat.}},

Title = {{Operational efficiency evaluation and system design improvements for
   carbon emissions trading pilots in China}},
Journal = {{CARBON MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{399-415}},
Abstract = {{Evaluating the operational efficiency of emissions trading pilots has
   become a crucial task faced by China's emissions trading scheme in its
   stable transition from pilot programs in limited areas to a nationwide
   carbon trading market. A number of factors contribute to the difficulty
   of such evaluations, such as differences in system design, the absence
   of evaluation systems and the complexity of external factors. A study of
   the seven major carbon emissions trading pilots in China was conducted.
   In this paper, the institutional arrangements of carbon emissions
   trading pilots are differentiated based on six dimensions: distribution
   systems, flexible mechanisms, emissions control scope, transaction
   rules, reporting and verification systems, and legal systems. In
   addition, an evaluation index system is constructed to determine the
   input and output efficiency of the carbon emissions trading market. The
   Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution
   (TOPSIS) method is used to calculate regional difference coefficients,
   revise the output index data, and effectively control the influence of
   the non-equilibrium external environment on efficiency. A Super Slack
   Based Model (Super-SBM) model is used to measure the operational
   efficiency of the carbon emissions trading market in the pilot area, and
   the results indicate that (1) for countries and regions with external
   environments facing uneven development, a differentiated system design
   should be developed; (2) the lack of changes in the overall ordering of
   the pilot efficiency demonstrates that institutional arrangements play a
   decisive role in the operational efficiency of China's carbon emissions
   trading market; and (3) none of the seven carbon emissions trading
   pilots has been operating effectively in China. The results indicate
   that a series of measures should be formulated, including the
   introduction of mechanisms for increasing quotas; increasing the
   flexibility of offsetting mechanisms; lowering the market access
   threshold; expanding the coverage of emissions control; training and
   restoring the professional monitoring reporting verification (MRV)
   ability; strengthening efforts associated within incentives and
   sanctions; and enhancing the legal enforcement of relevant policies.}},

   at the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) polluted site in North West

   Levels of dl-PCB in muscle tissues were above OSPAR environmental

Abstract = {{The Loess Plateau is known as one of the most severe soil erosion sites
   in the world. Over the last six decades, soil and water conservation
   measures have been implemented on the Loess Plateau, China, including
   the construction of terraces and warping dams, vegetation restoration,
   and the `Grain for Green Program', resulted in the land cover change. In
   this study, we focused on analysing the variation characteristics of
   streamflow-sediment behaviours and quantitatively calculating the
   effects of climate changes and human activities on annual streamflow and
   sediment load in the upper reaches of the Beiluo River of the Loess
   Plateau with extensive vegetation restoration. The daily hydrological
   data over the period of 1963-2011 were summed to assess the variation
   characteristics. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, Spearmen method
   and Pettitt's test were used to identify trends and shifts in
   hydrological factors. Moreover, the relative changes of the stream flow
   and sediment load were analysed around the change points. To further
   confirm the calculation results of the impacts of climate change and
   anthropogenic activities on annual streamflow and sediment load, the
   double-mass curve, correction coefficient methods and empirical
   hydrologic methods based on precipitation were used. The results showed
   that under the background of precipitation with no significant trend,
   both the streamflow and sediment load had a significant negative trend
   (P<0.01) with an average annual rate of -0.26 mm/a and -172 t/km(2). a.
   The annual streamflow decreased related to decreasing high flow (5\%) in
   the flood season in subsequent years, whereas an increase in low flow
   (95\%) was identified in the non-flood season. Two change points were
   detected in 1979 and 2002 for stream flow and sediment yield annually
   and in the flood season at the significance levels of p<0.05 and p<0.01,
   respectively, mostly because of the change point of the high flow in the
   flood season. Compared with PI (1963-1979), the dimension of the
   induction in the average sediment load was greater than the streamflow.
   The extreme ratio and the coefficient of variation about them in
   different periods after the change point also changed. Meanwhile, the
   stream flow for 5\% and 50\% decreased in PIE (1980-2002) and PHI
   (2003-2011), respectively, and increased for 95\%. The extent of the
   reduction in sediment load was greater than that of streamflow with the
   periods altered, and the changes in sediment load were negative. It was
   estimated that human activities including the underlying surface changes
   and conservation measures in PII accounted for 38.2\% and 51.4\% of the
   changes in streamflow and sediment load, respectively. In PILE, the
   effects reached 74.7\% and 86.7\%, respectively. The great improvement
   in the ecological environment on the Loess Plateau has already revealed
   the advantages of biological treatments in reducing flood volumes and
   compensating streamflow on a regional scale. The results can provide
   theoretical basis for water resource management and water and soil
   conservation for the administrators.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated that the pattern of land surface
   dynamic feedbacks (LSDF) based on remote sensing images after a rainfall
   event can be used to derive environmental covariates to assist in
   predicting soil texture variation over low -relief areas. However, the
   impact of the rainfall magnitude on the performance of these covariates
   has not been thoroughly investigated. The objective of this study was to
   investigate this impact during ten observation periods following
   rainfall events of different magnitudes (0-40 mm). An individual
   predictive soil mapping method (iPSM) was used to predict soil texture
   over space based on the environmental covariates derived from land
   surface dynamic feedbacks. The prediction error showed strong negative
   correlation with rainfall magnitude (Pearson's r between root mean
   squared error of prediction and rainfall magnitude = -0.943 for
   percentage of sand and -0.883 for percentage of clay). When the rainfall
   reaches a certain magnitude, the prediction error becomes stable. The
   recommended rain magnitude (threshold) using LSDF method in this study
   area is larger than 20 mm for both sand and clay percentage. The
   predictive maps based on different observed periods with similar
   rainfall magnitudes show only slight differences. Rainfall magnitude can
   thus be said to have a significant impact on the prediction accuracy of
   soil texture mapping. Greater rainfall magnitude will improve the
   prediction accuracy when using the LSDF. And high wind speed, high
   evaporation and low relative humidity during the observed periods also
   improved the prediction accuracy, all by stimulating differential soil
   drying. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   perturbation. The majority of these methods define thresholds as the
   perturbation points causing abrupt ecological response, but in reality
   most species or ecosystems do not show a break point response but more
   gradual transitional change to perturbation. We develop a new method
   which delineates thresholds as a region in which the slope of the
   relationship between ecological response (y) and perturbation (x; e.g.
   habitat loss) is larger than 1: vertical bar|dy/dx vertical bar >= 1,
   where both x-and y-axes are scaled to (0, 1) range. The lower end of
   threshold zones so defined is of particular ecological interest because
   it is the smallest x that may trigger impending catastrophic response to
   a small change in x. We derived two landscape models (edge length and
   the number of patches of species distribution) and two biodiversity
   models (endemics-area relationship and half-population curve) to test
   this method. We applied our zonal thresholding method to these four
   models fit to empirical data of two forest plots to detect thresholds of
   species distribution to habitat loss. The two landscape metric models
   predict that no species could tolerate more than 40\% of habitat loss
   and these thresholds can be much lower for relatively rare species with
   occupancy <0.4 and for aggregated habitat loss compared to random
   habitat loss. The half-population model leads to a similar threshold
   level of 40\% habitat loss. Overall, we suggest the maximum permissible
   habitat loss threshold to be between 0-40\%, depending on the
   pre-disturbed occupancy (or abundance) of a species. This habitat loss
   threshold falls within the otherwise wide range of thresholds calculated
   from conventional methods. Our study contributes novel methods and
   models to quantify the effect of habitat loss on species distribution
   and diversity in landscapes with potential for conservation
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have described fungal communities in indoor environments
   using gene sequencing-based approaches. In this study, dust-borne fungal
   communities were elucidated from a water-damaged office building located
   in the northeastern region of the United States using internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA gene sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted
   from 5mg of floor dust derived from 22 samples collected from either the
   lower floors (n = 8) or a top floor (n = 14) of the office building. ITS
   gene sequencing resolved a total of 933 ITS sequences and was clustered
   into 216 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Analysis of fungal
   OTUs at the 97\% similarity threshold showed a difference between the
   lower and top floors that was marginally significant (p = 0.049).
   Species richness and diversity indices were reduced in the lower floor
   samples compared to the top floor samples and there was a high degree of
   compositional dissimilarity within and between the two different areas
   within the building. Fungal OTUs were placed in the phyla Ascomycota
   (55\%), Basidiomycota (41\%), Zygomycota (3\%), Glomeromycota (0.4\%),
   Chytridiomycota (0.3\%), and unassigned fungi (0.5\%). The Ascomycota
   classes with the highest relative abundances included the
   Dothideomycetes (30\%) and Eurotiomycetes (16\%). The Basidiomycota
   consisted of the classes Ustilaginomycetes (14\%), Tremellomycetes
   (11\%), and Agaricomycetes (8\%). Sequence reads derived from the plant
   pathogen Ustilago syntherismae were the most abundant in the analysis as
   were obligate Basidiomycota yeast species that accounted for 12\% and
   11\% of fungal ITS sequences, respectively. ITS gene sequencing provides
   additional insight into the diversity of fungal OTUs. These data further
   highlight the contribution of fungi placed in the phylum Basidiomycota,
   obligate yeasts, as well as xerophilic species that are typically not
   resolved using traditional culture methods.}},

Abstract = {{Streams in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, Washington, British Columbia)
   face rising summer temperatures and increasing anthropogenic influence,
   with consequences for fish populations. Guidance is needed in small
   managed watersheds for setting reservoir release rates or for the
   restriction of water extractions to meet the needs of fish and aquatic
   ecosystems. Existing environmental flow methods focus on discharge rates
   and do not typically consider water temperatures, and detailed thermal
   models are too complex for widespread implementation. We used multiple
   logistic regression to develop statistical models for estimating the
   probability of exceeding a salmonid stream temperature threshold of 22
   degrees C as a function of discharge and maximum daily air temperatures.
   Data required are air temperature, stream temperature and stream
   discharge over a minimum of one summer. The models are used to make
   minimum discharge recommendations under varying forecast weather
   conditions. The method was applied to nine streams in the Pacific
   Northwest. Minimum recommended discharge generally ranged from 23\% to
   86\% of mean annual discharge and was higher than observed low flows in
   most streams. Comparison of the new method to existing methods for
   Fortune Creek in British Columbia indicated that total season discharge
   volumes could be reduced while meeting thermal requirements. For other
   streams, it was evident that high water temperatures cannot be managed
   by increasing discharge, as the discharge required would be greater than
   natural discharge and higher than achievable by management. The
   statistical method described in this paper allows for a risk-based
   approach to discharge management for fish habitat needs.}},

Abstract = {{Age at maturity (AAM) is a key life history trait that provides insight
   into ecology, evolution, and population dynamics. However, maturity data
   can be costly to collect or may not be available. Life history theory
   suggests that growth is biphasic for many organisms, with a change-point
   in growth occurring at maturity. If so, then it should be possible to
   use a biphasic growth model to estimate AAM from growth data. To test
   this prediction, we used the Lester biphasic growth model in a
   likelihood profiling framework to estimate AAM from length at age data.
   We fit our model to simulated growth trajectories to determine minimum
   data requirements (in terms of sample size, precision in length at age,
   and the cost to somatic growth of maturity) for accurate AAM estimates.
   We then applied our method to a large walleye Sander vitreus data set
   and show that our AAM estimates are in close agreement with conventional
   estimates when our model fits well. Finally, we highlight the potential
   of our method by applying it to length at age data for a variety of

Title = {{Reducing soil fertility to enable ecological restoration: A new method
   to test the efficacy of Full-Inversion Tillage}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{257-263}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Ecological restoration of high-quality, semi-natural communities of
   conservation value on ex-arable soils with raised fertility has been a
   major problem in northern Europe. One suggested way of tackling this
   problem is to use Full-Inversion Tillage (FIT) where the fertile
   top-soil is moved below infertile subsurface layers. This should provide
   infertile conditions at least in the short- to medium-term for the
   establishment of communities that require these conditions. Here, we
   pioneer a rigorous test of the efficacy of this approach. Our new
   method, using Principal Response Curves (PRCs), overcomes the difficulty
   in testing for change in soil physico-chemical properties down soil
   profiles with the inherent problem of autocorrelations between soil
   layers. Principal Response Curves (PRCs) is a multivariate technique,
   usually used to test for effects of treatment effects through time on a
   community matrix. We propose an extension of their use for the
   multivariate analysis of properties down a soil-depth profile. We tested
   the effects of FIT in two contrasting soils, before and after treatment.
   In a clay loam soil, FIT was effective in reducing the soil fertility in
   the surface 12 cm. Indeed the soil available P concentration, a key
   variable, was more than halved in the surface layers, and was below the
   lowest literature target threshold for the establishment of semi-natural
   grassland. In contrast, in the sandy soil, soil properties increased
   throughout the profile after FIT, primarily because of the pre-treatment
   nutrient distribution within the soil. Before FIT treatment, the maximum
   concentrations of most measured variables were at mid-depth and FIT
   redistributed these to the surface and bottom layers. Our results
   demonstrate the potential for FIT in ecological restoration, but
   indicate that its efficacy depends on soil type and the site history. We
   recommend that in future a pre-treatment assessment of soil properties
   with depth is undertaken before FIT is implemented, and that afterwards
   our PRC approach can be used to test efficacy immediately after
   treatment, and has the potential for measuring soil resilience to
   perturbation through time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{152}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although the effects of noise on population morbidity and
   mortality have been observed both in the short and long term, the
   morbidity and mortality indicators used to date have not enabled
   information on such health effects to be accessed in real time. At an
   international level, there are relatively few studies, mostly recent,
   which have considered an alternative indicator, such as the demand for
   medical attention provided by emergency services, taking into account
   environmental factors other than noise.
   Objectives: To ascertain the short-term effect of road-traffic noise
   levels on medical care, broken down by organic, circulatory and
   respiratory causes, provided by the Madrid Regional Medical Emergency
   Service (Servicio de Urgencia Medica de Madrid/SUMMA 112).
   Methods: We used an ecological time-series study and fitted Poisson
   regression models, to analyse the number of daily, cause-specific
   episodes of care provided in situ by SUMMA 112, via emergency ambulance
   dispatches, across the period 01/01/2008-31/12/2009. To this end, we
   considered diurnal (Leqd: 7-23 h), nocturnal (Leqn: 23-7 h) and daily
   (Leq24: 24 h) noise (in db(A)) as the principal factor, and chemical air
   pollution (mu g/m(3)) and temperature (degrees C) as the control
   variables. We also controlled for trend and seasonalities, the
   autoregressive nature of the series, and day of the week.
   Results: Nocturnal noise exceeded the WHO threshold (55 db(A)) on 100\%
   of nights, despite displaying a downward trend across the study period.
   For all causes, with the exception of emergency calls due to ischaemic
   disease, it was nocturnal rather than diurnal noise levels that had a
   short-term effect (lags 0-1) on SUMMA 112 calls, with this impact being
   greater for respiratory than for circulatory causes. Hence, for every
   increase of 1db in Leqn, the relative risks (RRs) were as follows: 1.11
   (95\% CI 1.09-1.13) for organic causes; 1.14 (95\% CI: 1.11-1.18) for
   respiratory causes; and 1.08 (95\% CI: 1.05-1.10) for circulatory
   causes.
   Conclusion: SUMMA 112 data give access to real-time information on the
   health effects associated with increases in noise levels, which cannot
   be obtained via mortality or hospital-admission data, since these are
   collected in the longer term. Accordingly, this is something that would
   be immediately applicable in any future implementation of a syndromic
   surveillance system focusing on the effects of environmental pollutants
   on health.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Spain has one of the highest proportions of dementia in the
   world among the population aged 60 years or over. Recent studies link
   various environmental factors to neurocognitive-type diseases. This
   study sought to analyse whether urban risk factors such as traffic
   noise, pollutants and heat waves might have a short-term impact on
   exacerbation of symptoms of dementia, leading to emergency hospital
   admission.
   Material and methods: We conducted a longitudinal ecological time-series
   study, with the dependent variable being the number of daily
   dementia-related emergency (DDE) hospital admissions to Madrid municipal
   hospitals (ICD-10 codes 290.0-290.2, 290.4-290.9, 294.1-294) from 01 to
   01-2001 to 31-12-2009, as obtained from the Hospital Morbidity Survey
   (National Statistics Institute). The measures used were as follows: for
   noise pollution, Leqd, equivalent diurnal noise level (from 8 to 22 h),
   and Leqn, equivalent nocturnal noise level (from 22 to 8 h) in dB(A);
   for chemical pollution, mean daily NO2, PM2.5, PM1 as provided by the
   Madrid Municipal Air Quality Monitoring Grid; and lastly, maximum daily
   temperature (degrees C), as supplied by the State Meteorological Agency.
   Scatterplot diagrams were plotted to assess the type of functional
   relationship existing between the main variable of analysis and the
   environmental variables. The lags of the environmental variables were
   calculated to analyse the timing of the effect. Poisson regression
   models were fitted, controlling for trends and seasonalities, to
   quantify relative risk (RR).
   Results: During the study period, there were 1175 DDE hospital
   admissions. These admissions displayed a linear functional relationship
   without a threshold in the case of Leqd. The RR of DDE admissions was
   1.15 (1.11-1.20) for an increase of 1 dB in Leqd, with impact at lag 0.
   In the case of maximum daily temperature, there was a threshold
   temperature of 34 degrees C, with an increase of 1 degrees C over this
   threshold posing an RR of 1.19 (1.09-1.30) at lag 1. The only pollutant
   to show an association with DDE hospital admissions was 03 at lag 5,
   with an RR of 1.09 (1.04-1.15) for an increase of 10 mu g/m(3)
   Conclusions: Diurnal traffic noise, heat waves and tropospheric ozone
   may exacerbate the symptoms of dementia to the point of requiring
   emergency admission to hospital. Lowering exposure levels to these
   environmental factors could reduce dementia-related admissions in
   Madrid.}},

Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-74}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Dispersal ecology is a topical discipline that involves understanding
   and predicting plant community responses to multiple drivers of global
   change. Propagule movements that entail long-distance dispersal (LDD)
   events are crucial for plants to reach and colonize suitable sites
   across fragmented landscapes. Yet, LDD events are extremely rare, and
   thus, obtaining reliable estimates of the maximum distances that
   propagules move across and of their frequency has been a long-lasting
   challenge in plant ecology. Recent advances in dispersal ecology have
   provided reliable records of dispersal distances, but they remain
   confined to focal populations, limiting our ability to infer the
   frequency and actual extent of LDD events across landscapes.
   2. In this study, we view LDD events as extreme values of a dispersal
   function, and we apply statistics of extremes to derive the frequency
   and extent of LDD events of simulated and empirical data sets. We first
   briefly explain the rationale behind statistics of extremes, and we then
   illustrate how dispersal ecology can benefit conceptually and
   analytically from applying extreme value analyses. We apply the block
   maxima approach to simulated seed shadows, and we apply the peak over a
   threshold method to empirical data sets that contain pollen and seed
   dispersal distances recorded for a population of Prunus mahaleb, an
   insect-pollinated and vertebrate-dispersed tree species.
   3. Diagnostic plots reveal a distance threshold of upsilon = 80 m for
   pollen grains and of upsilon = 170 m for dispersed seeds. Values that
   exceed the threshold fit a light-tailed distribution function for pollen
   and fit a fat-tailed Pareto distribution for seed dispersal distances.
   Both distribution functions estimate a low (but nonzero) conditional
   probability of reaching distant locations, extending well beyond the
   borders of our focal population as follows: Pr (X >= 1 km) = 9 x 10(-5)
   for pollen grains and Pr (X >= 10 km) = 7 x 10(-5) for dispersed seeds.
   4. Synthesis. Dispersal ecologists can take the most of their dispersal
   distance records by applying statistics of extremes to infer the
   probability of occurrence of extremely rare, but crucial, long distance
   dispersal events that reach locations well beyond focal populations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Inverse associations have been observed between memory
   performance and blood concentrations of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb). Low
   antioxidant cell activity has also been linked to decline in memory due
   to aging. However, it has not yet been established whether the heavy
   metal-memory relationship is mediated by differences in antioxidant
   activity.
   Methods: We examined Cd and Pb levels, as well as oxidative stress
   parameters, in blood samples from 125 older adults (age range 50-82
   years). The Counting Span Test (CST) was used to evaluate working memory
   capacity (WMC). The Monte Carlo Method for Assessing Mediation (MCMAM)
   was used to analyze the mediation role of antioxidant activity in the
   heavy metals-memory association.
   Results: High blood Cd (BCd) concentration alone, and in combination
   with elevated blood Pb (BPb) concentration, was associated with poor WMC
   (p = 0.001) and low enzymatic antioxidant defenses (p = 0.006). The
   variance in WMC accounted for by BCd or by BCd combine with BPb was
   20.6\% and 18.6\%, respectively. The MCMAM revealed that the influence
   of BCd and BPb concentrations on WMC was mediated by low antioxidant
   capacity (confidence interval -CI: 0.072 to -0.064 for BCd; CI: -0.062
   to -0.045 for BPb).
   Conclusion: These findings showed Pb and Cd blood concentration in older
   adults, even at levels below the current recommended threshold, was
   negatively associated with WMC and that this relationship may be partly
   mediated by low antioxidant defenses. Knowledge on the environmental
   factors that negatively influence brain and cognition during aging can
   help inform public policy strategies to prevent and control the adverse
   effects of environmental contaminant exposure during aging. (C) 2016

   more than 80\% of lead was removed from Gabes marine sediments. The
   reduction of cooper concentration, in sediments after treatment, ranged

Abstract = {{Among the environmental stresses experienced by bacteria, temperature
   shifts are one of the most important. In this study, we discovered a
   novel cold adaptation mechanism in Shewanella oneidensis that occurs at
   the DNA level and is regulated by cryptic prophage excision. Previous
   studies on bacterial cold tolerance mainly focus on the structural
   change of cell membrane and changes at the RNA and protein levels.
   Whether or not genomic change can also contribute to this process has
   not been explored. Here we employed a whole-genome deep-sequencing
   method to probe the changes at DNA level in a model psychrotrophic
   bacteria strain. We found that temperature downshift induced a 10
   000-fold increase of the excision of a novel P4-like cryptic prophage.
   Importantly, although prophage excision only occurred in a relatively
   small population of bacteria, it was able to facilitate biofilm
   formation and promote the survival of the entire population. This
   prophage excision affected cell physiology by disrupting a critical gene
   encoding transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA). In addition, we found that the
   histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) could silence prophage
   excision via binding to the promoter of the putative excisionase gene at
   warm temperatures. H-NS level was reduced at cold temperatures, leading
   to de-repression of prophage excision. Collectively, our results reveal
   that cryptic prophage excision acts as a regulatory switch to enable the
   survival of the host at low temperature by controlling the activity of
   tmRNA and biofilm formation.}},

Abstract = {{The reduction of the use of herbicides is a valuable objective both from

   adoption of precision weed management, i.e. spraying only the areas of

   geostatistical simulation of weed spatial patterns coupled with crop

   illustrated as a tool to identify convenient weed density thresholds.
   The method is illustrated in an application concerning two weeds species
   (Avena sterilis L. and Apera spica-venti L.) in wheat. The proposed

Pages = {{9274-9289}},

Abstract = {{For morphodynamic studies, it is important to compute not only the
   transported volumes of bed load, but also the size of the transported
   material. A few bed load equations compute fractional transport (i. e.,
   both the volume and grain size distribution), but many equations compute
   only the bulk transport (a volume) with no consideration of the
   transported grain sizes. To fill this gap, a method is proposed to
   compute the bed load grain size distribution separately to the bed load
   flux. The method is called the Generalized Threshold Model (GTM),
   because it extends the flow competence method for threshold of motion of
   the largest transported grain size to the full bed surface grain size
   distribution. This was achieved by replacing dimensional diameters with
   their size indices in the standard hiding function, which offers a
   useful framework for computation, carried out for each indices
   considered in the range {[}1, 100]. New functions are also proposed to
   account for partial transport. The method is very simple to implement
   and is sufficiently flexible to be tested in many environments. In
   addition to being a good complement to standard bulk bed load equations,
   it could also serve as a framework to assist in analyzing the physics of
   bed load transport in future research.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have considered the effect of temperature and a change
   point in association with increased mortality. However, the relationship
   between temperature and mortality cannot be described using a parametric
   model and is highly dependent on the number of change points. Knowing
   the change points of temperature may prevent further mortality
   associated with the weather. The current available methods consist of
   two steps: they first estimate the models and then detect change points
   without testing. However, the methods for simultaneously identifying the
   nonlinear relationship and detecting the number of change points are
   quite limited. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a unified approach
   simultaneously estimates the nonlinear relationship and detects
   multichange points. We propose a semiparametric single index multichange
   points model as our unified approach by adjusting for several other
   covariates. We also provide a permutation-based testing procedure to
   detect multichange points. A criterion for predetermining the maximum
   possible number of change points is introduced, which is required by the
   permutation test procedure. Our approach is unaffected by the degree of
   smoothing of the nonparametric function. Our proposed model is compared
   to the generalized linear model and generalized additive model using
   simulation and a real application. Our approach outperforms these models
   in both model fitting and detection of change point(s). We also show the
   asymptotic properties of the permutation test for semiparametric single
   index multichange points model, suggesting that the number of change
   points is consistent. The advantage of our approach is demonstrated
   using the mortality data of Seoul, South Korea.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological shifts in shallow lakes from clear-water macrophyte-dominated
   to turbid-water phytoplankton-dominated are generally thought of as
   rapid short-term transitions. Diatom remains in sediment records from
   shallow lakes in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America provide new
   evidence that the long-term ecological stability of these lakes is
   defined by the legacy of large regime shifts. We examine the modern and
   historical stability of 11 shallow lakes. Currently, four of the lakes
   are in a clear-water state, three are consistently turbid-water, and
   four have been observed to change state from year to year
   (transitional). Lake sediment records spanning the past 150-200 yr
   suggest that (1) the diatom assemblage is characteristic of either clear
   or turbid lakes, (2) prior to significant landscape alteration, all of
   the lakes existed in a regime of a stable clear-water state, (3) lakes
   that are currently classified as turbid or transitional have experienced
   one strong regime shift over the past 150-200 yr and have since remained
   in a regime where turbid-water predominates, and (4) top-down impacts to
   the lake food-web from fish introductions appear to be the dominant
   driver of strong regime shifts and not increased nutrient availability.
   Based on our findings we demonstrate a method that could be used by lake
   managers to identify lakes that have an ecological history close to the
   clear-turbid regime threshold; such lakes might more easily be returned
   to a clear-water state through biomanipulation. The unfortunate reality
   is that many of these lakes are now part of a managed landscape and will
   likely require continued intervention.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{368-376}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Biodiversity loss can be accelerated by human consumption in regions
   that are far removed from habitat degradation because of economic
   globalization, but no study has directly quantified the effects of
   global trade on extinction risks at a global scale with consideration
   for species differences. We propose a novel biodiversity footprint index
   based on bird extinction risks to evaluate the effects of global wood
   production and trade on biodiversity. Using 536 endangered bird species
   threatened by wood harvesting and logging, we calculated the
   ``quasi-extinction{''} probabilities, that is, the probabilities that
   population sizes become lower than an extinction threshold after habitat
   loss based on initial population sizes and forest habitat loss rates. We
   then used bilateral wood trade data to link the biodiversity impacts in
   wood exporters to wood importers. We found that if recent trends in
   forest cover loss continue until 2100, bird species in Brazil would be
   the most rapidly and heavily affected by wood production and trade,
   followed by those in Indonesia; these two countries alone would account
   for about half of all global bird extinctions. Large-scale wood
   importers (i.e., China, Japan, and the United States) significantly
   elevate overseas extinction risks and, simultaneously, reduce domestic
   impacts, indicating a heavy responsibility of these countries for global
   biodiversity loss. We also conducted a scenario analysis, which showed
   that the total projected number of extinct species would not decrease if
   each country produced the amount of wood materials necessary to meet
   current consumption levels. This is because bird extinction risks in
   tropical wood importers, such as Mexico and the Philippines, as well as
   Japan and China will increase if these countries increase domestic wood
   production. Our biodiversity footprint index is useful to identify
   countries whose bird species are highly affected by wood production and
   trade, and to quantify the role of wood trade in bird species
   extinctions. Additional scenario analyses are needed to establish
   effective patterns of wood production and consumption for bird
   biodiversity conservation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The macronutrients nitrate and phosphate are aquatic pollutants that
   arise naturally, however, in excess concentrations they can be harmful
   to human health and ecosystems. These pollutants are driven by river
   currents and show dynamics that are affected by weather patterns and
   extreme rainfall events. As a result, the nutrient budget in the
   receiving estuaries and coasts can change suddenly and seasonally,
   causing ecological damage to resident wildlife and fish populations. In
   this paper, we propose a statistical change-point model with
   interactions between time and river flow, to capture the macronutrient
   dynamics and their responses to river flow threshold behaviour. It also
   accounts for the nonlinear effect of water quality properties via
   nonparametric penalised splines. This model enables us to estimate the
   daily levels of riverine macronutrient fluxes and their seasonal and
   annual totals. In particular, we present a study of macronutrient
   dynamics on the Hampshire Avon River, which flows to the southern coast
   of the UK through the Christchurch Harbour estuary. We model daily data
   for more than a year during 2013-14 in which period there were multiple
   severe meteorological conditions leading to localised flooding. Adopting
   a Bayesian inference framework, we have quantified riverine
   macronutrient fluxes based on input river flow values. Out of sample
   empirical validation methods justify our approach, which captures also
   the dependencies of macronutrient concentrations with water body
   characteristics. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of regulatory actions designed to improve air quality
   is often assessed by predicting changes in public health resulting from
   their implementation. Risk of premature mortality from long-term
   exposure to ambient air pollution is the single most important
   contributor to such assessments and is estimated from observational
   studies generally assuming a log-linear, no-threshold association
   between ambient concentrations and death. There has been only limited
   assessment of this assumption in part because of a lack of methods to
   estimate the shape of the exposure-response function in very large study
   populations. In this paper, we propose a new class of variable
   coefficient risk functions capable of capturing a variety of potentially
   non-linear associations which are suitable for health impact assessment.
   We construct the class by defining transformations of concentration as
   the product of either a linear or log-linear function of concentration
   multiplied by a logistic weighting function. These risk functions can be
   estimated using hazard regression survival models with currently
   available computer software and can accommodate large population-based
   cohorts which are increasingly being used for this purpose. We
   illustrate our modeling approach with two large cohort studies of
   long-term concentrations of ambient air pollution and mortality: the
   American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS II) cohort and
   the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC). We then
   estimate the number of deaths attributable to changes in fine
   particulate matter concentrations over the 2000 to 2010 time period in
   both Canada and the USA using both linear and non-linear hazard function

Abstract = {{Despite considered a non-consumptive use of the marine environment,
   diving-related activities can cause damages to coral reefs. It is
   imminent to assess the maximum numbers of divers that can be

   The results indicated that the proportion of diver damaged hard corals

Abstract = {{Background: The use of light level loggers (geolocators) to understand
   movements and distributions in terrestrial and marine vertebrates,
   particularly during the non-breeding period, has increased dramatically
   in recent years. However, inferring positions from light data is not
   straightforward, often relies on assumptions that are difficult to test,
   or includes an element of subjectivity.
   Results: We present an intuitive framework to compute locations from
   twilight events collected by geolocators from different manufacturers.
   The procedure uses an iterative forward step selection, weighting each
   possible position using a set of parameters that can be specifically
   selected for each analysis. The approach was tested on data from two
   wide-ranging seabird species-black-browed albatross Thalassarche
   melanophris and wandering albatross Diomedea exulans-tracked at Bird
   Island, South Georgia, during the two most contrasting periods of the
   year in terms of light regimes (solstice and equinox). Using additional
   information on travel speed, sea surface temperature and land avoidance,
   our approach was considerably more accurate than the traditional
   threshold method (errors reduced to medians of 185 km and 145 km for
   solstice and equinox periods, respectively).
   Conclusions: The algorithm computes stable results with uncertainty
   estimates, including around the equinoxes, and does not require
   calibration of solar angles. Accuracy can be increased by assimilating
   information on travel speed and behaviour, as well as environmental
   data. This framework is available through the open source R package
   probGLS, and can be applied in a wide range of biologging studies.}},

Abstract = {{There is considerable concern over the potential ecotoxicity to soil
   ecosystems posed,by zero-valent iron nanoparticles (Fe-0 NPs) released

   risk assessment has hampered the development of appropriate testing
   methods used in environmental applications. Here we present a novel,
   empirical approach to assess Fe-0 NPs-associated soil ecosystems health
   risk using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism. A
   Hill-based dose-response model describing the concentration-fertility
   inhibition relationships was constructed. A Weibull model was used to
   estimate thresholds as a guideline to protect C. elegans from
   infertility when exposed to waterborne or foodborne Fe NPs. Finally, the
   risk metrics, exceedance risk (ER) and risk quotient (RQ) of Fe-0 NPs in
   various depths and distances from remediation sites can then be
   predicted. We showed that under 50\% risk probability (ER = 0.5), upper
   soil layer had the highest infertility risk (95\% confidence interval:
   13.18-57.40\%). The margins of safety and acceptable criteria for soil
   ecosystems health for using Fe-0 NPs in field scale applications were
   also recommended. Results showed that RQs are larger than I in all soil
   layers when setting a stricter threshold of similar to 1.02 mg L-1 of Fe

Abstract = {{Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling can be a highly sensitive method for
   detecting aquatic taxa; however, the cost-efficiency of this technique
   relative to traditional methods has not been rigorously assessed. We
   show how methods that account for imperfect and stochastic detection can
   be used to (i) determine the optimal allocation of survey effort with
   eDNA sampling for a fixed budget (i.e. identify the optimal combination
   of water samples vs. site visits), and (ii) assess the cost-efficiency
   of eDNA sampling relative to traditional survey techniques. We
   illustrate this approach by comparing eDNA sampling and bottle-trapping
   for an exotic newt species (Lissotriton v. vulgaris) recently detected
   in Melbourne, Australia. Bottle traps produced much lower detection
   rates than eDNA sampling, but the cost-efficiency of the two methods can
   be similar because bottle-trapping is cheaper per sample. The relative
   cost-efficiency of the two sampling methods was sensitive to the
   available survey budget, the costs of eDNA primer/probe development and
   sample processing and the number of positive quantitative PCR assays
   (qPCRs) used to designate a water sample as positive for newt DNA.
   Environmental DNA sampling was more cost-efficient than bottle-trapping
   for small to intermediate budgets when primer/probe development and
   sample processing costs were low, and 1/4 or 2/4 positive qPCRs were
   used to label a water sample as positive for newt eDNA. However, bottle
   traps were generally more cost-efficient than eDNA sampling when
   primer/probe development and sample processing costs were high,
   regardless of qPCR threshold or survey budget. Traditional sampling
   methods may achieve lower detection probabilities compared to eDNA
   sampling, but the totality of costs can make eDNA sampling less
   efficient than traditional techniques in some circumstances. Our
   approach provides a quantitative framework for determining how many
   water samples and site visits are required to maximize detection
   probabilities with eDNA sampling, and can calculate the cost-efficiency
   of any sampling method.}},

Abstract = {{Climate changes are expected to increase fire frequency, fire season
   length, and cumulative area burned in the western United States. We
   focus on the potential impact of mid-21st-century climate changes on
   annual burn probability, fire season length, and large fire
   characteristics including number and size for a study area in the
   Northern Rocky Mountains. Although large fires are rare they account for
   most of the area burned in western North America, burn under extreme
   weather conditions, and exhibit behaviors that preclude methods of
   direct control. Allocation of resources, development of management
   plans, and assessment of fire effects on ecosystems all require an
   understanding of when and where fires are likely to burn, particularly
   under altered climate regimes that may increase large fire occurrence.
   We used the large fire simulation model FSim to model ignition, growth,
   and containment of wildfires under two climate scenarios: contemporary
   (based on instrumental weather) and mid-century (based on an ensemble
   average of global climate models driven by the A1B SRES emissions
   scenario). Modeled changes in fire patterns include increased annual
   burn probability, particularly in areas of the study region with
   relatively short contemporary fire return intervals; increased
   individual fire size and annual area burned; and fewer years without
   large fires. High fire danger days, represented by threshold values of
   Energy Release Component (ERC), are projected to increase in number,
   especially in spring and fall, lengthening the climatic fire season. For
   fire managers, ERC is an indicator of fire intensity potential and fire
   economics, with higher ERC thresholds often associated with larger, more
   expensive fires. Longer periods of elevated ERC may significantly
   increase the cost and complexity of fire management activities,
   requiring new strategies to maintain desired ecological conditions and
   limit fire risk. Increased fire activity (within the historical range of
   frequency and severity, and depending on the extent to which ecosystems
   are adapted) may maintain or restore ecosystem functionality; however,
   in areas that are highly departed from historical fire regimes or where
   there is disequilibrium between climate and vegetation, ecosystems may
   be rapidly and persistently altered by wildfires, especially those that
   burn under extreme conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Most environmental epidemiology studies model health effects of noise by
   regressing on acoustic exposure metrics that are based on the concept of
   average energetic dose over longer time periods (i.e. the L-eq and
   related measures). Regarding noise effects on health and wellbeing,
   average measures often cannot satisfactorily predict annoyance and
   somatic health effects of noise, particularly sleep disturbances. It has
   been hypothesized that effects of noise can be better explained when
   also considering the variation of the level over time and the frequency
   distribution of event-related acoustic measures, such as for example,
   the maximum sound pressure level. However, it is unclear how this is
   best parametrized in a metric that is not correlated with the L-eq, but
   takes into account the frequency distribution of events and their
   emergence from background. In this paper, a calculation method is
   presented that produces a metric which reflects the intermittency of
   road, rail and aircraft noise exposure situations. The metric termed
   intermittency ratio (IR) expresses the proportion of the acoustical
   energy contribution in the total energetic dose that is created by
   individual noise events above a certain threshold. To calculate the
   metric, it is shown how to estimate the distribution of maximum pass-by
   levels from information on geometry (distance and angle), traffic flow
   (number and speed) and single-event pass-by levels per vehicle category.
   On the basis of noise maps that simultaneously visualize L-eq, as well
   as IR, the differences of both metrics are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Erosion and sediment control products have become an integral part of

   by researchers at the Auburn University-Erosion and Sediment Control
   Testing Facility (AU-ESCTF). This metric is based on hydraulic
   conditions created by a ditch check to slow flow velocity and transform
   kinetic energy to potential energy. Using the ratio of water depth (y)
   to specific energy (E), the average performance can be quantified and
   compared with counterparts and traditional practices, even if data were
   developed under different flow conditions or channel geometries. While
   using the y/E ratio to determine kinetic energy reduction, a

Abstract = {{Vulnerability assessment of simple landfills was conducted using the

   in landfill and waste pile models were calculated by the 3MRA model.
   Furthermore, the vulnerability indexes of the six contaminants were
   predicted based on the model calculation. The results showed that the
   order of health risk vulnerability index was As > Hg(II) > Cr(VI) >
   benzene > Cd > Ni(II) in the landfill model, whereas the ecology risk
   vulnerability index was in the order of As > Hg(II) > Cr(VI) > Cd >

   contamination should employ undemanding species that rapidly react to
   the presence of contaminants in their environment The demonstrated
   reaction should be comprehensible and unambiguously evidential of the

   mg/L) and permethrin (0.05, 0.029, 0.017, 0.01 mu g/L). We hypothesize
   that the number of larvae that show advanced trajectories in a group
   corresponds with water contamination, as the latter triggers avoidance
   behavior in the organisms. The proportion of advanced trajectories in
   the control and treated groups during the first minute of darkness was
   designated as a segregation parameter. It was parametrized and a
   threshold value was set using one CdCl2 trial and then applied to the
   remaining CdCl2 and permethrin replicates. For all cases, the method
   allowed distinguishing between the control and treated groups within two
   cycles of light: dark. The calculated parameter was statistically

Abstract = {{In this study, we developed a method to quantify and link the toxic

   to a concentration gradient of petroleum hydrocarbons ranging from 0 to
   8.0 mg L-1. A three-population ecological model with interspecies
   competition-grazing relationships was used to characterize population
   sizes with concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons. A threshold
   concentration of the simplified plankton ecosystem of 0.376 mg L-1 for
   petroleum hydrocarbons was calculated from the proposed model, which was

   This finding indicates that interspecies competition and grazing reduced
   the toxic effect of petroleum hydrocarbons at the community level. The
   sensitivity analysis for model parameters demonstrates that plankton
   population biomasses are highly sensitive to filtration rates.
   Antagonism between interspecies interactions and petroleum hydrocarbon

Abstract = {{Diffuse phosphorus (P) mitigation in agricultural catchments should be
   targeted at critical source areas (CSAs) that consider source and
   transport factors. However, development of CSA identification needs to
   consider the mobilisation potential of legacy soil P sources at the
   field scale, and the control of (micro) topography on runoff generation
   and hydrological connectivity at the sub-field scale. To address these
   limitations, a `next generation' sub-field scale CSA index is presented,
   which predicts the risk of dissolved P losses in runoff from legacy soil
   P. The GIS-based CSA Index integrates two factors; mobile soil P
   concentrations (water extractable P; WEP) and a hydrologically sensitive
   area (HSA) index. The HSA Index identifies runoff-generating-areas using
   high resolution LiDAR Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), a soil
   topographic index (STI) and information on flow sinks and effects on
   hydrological connectivity. The CSA Index was developed using four
   intensively monitored agricultural catchments (7.5-11 km(2)) in Ireland
   with contrasting agri-environmental conditions. Field scale soil WEP
   concentrations were estimated using catchment and land use specific
   relationships with Morgan P concentrations. In-stream total reactive P
   (TRP) concentrations and discharge were measured sub-hourly at catchment
   outlet bankside analysers and gauging stations during winter closed
   periods for fertiliser spreading in 2009-14, and hydrograph/loadograph
   separation methods were used to estimate TRP loads and proportions from
   quicicflow (surface runoff). A strong relationship between TRP
   concentrations in quicicflow and soil WEP concentrations (r(2) = 0.73)
   was used to predict dissolved P concentrations in runoff at the field
   scale, which were then multiplied by the HSA Index to generate sub-field
   scale CSA Index maps. Evaluation of the tool showed a very strong
   relationship between the total CSA Index value within the HSA and the
   total TRP load in quickflow (r(2) = 0.86). Using a CSA Index threshold
   value of >= 0.5, the CSA approach identified 1.1-5.6\% of catchment
   areas at highest risk of legacy soil P transfers, compared with
   4.0-26.5\% of catchment areas based on an existing approach that uses
   above agronomic optimum soil P status. The tool could be used to aid
   cost-effective targeting of sub-field scale mitigation measures and best
   management practices at delivery points of CSA pathways to reduce
   dissolved P losses from legacy P stores and support sustainable
   agricultural production. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{1. Ecologists and many evolutionary biologists relate the variation in
   physiological, behavioural, life-history, demographic, population and
   community traits to the variation in weather, a key environmental
   driver. However, identifying which weather variables (e.g. rain,
   temperature, El Nino index), over which time period (e.g. recent
   weather, spring or year-round weather) and in what ways (e.g. mean,
   threshold of temperature) they affect biological responses is by no
   means trivial, particularly when traits are expressed at different times
   among individuals.
   2. A literature review shows that a systematic approach for identifying
   weather signals is lacking and that the majority of studies select
   weather variables from a small number of competing hypotheses that are
   founded on unverified a priori assumptions. This is worrying because
   studies that investigate the nature of weather signals in detail suggest
   that signals can be complex. Using suboptimal or wrongly identified
   weather signals may lead to unreliable projections and management
   decisions.
   3. We propose a four-step approach that allows for more rigorous
   identification and quantification of weather signals (or any other
   predictor variable for which data are available at high temporal
   resolution), easily implementable with our new R package `climwin'. We
   compare our approach with conventional approaches and provide worked
   examples.
   4. Although our more exploratory approach also has some drawbacks, such
   as the risk of overfitting and bias that our simulations show can occur
   at low sample and effect sizes, these issues can be addressed with the
   right knowledge and tools.
   5. By developing both the methods to fit critical weather windows to a
   wide range of biological responses and the tools to validate them and
   determine sample size requirements, our approach facilitates the
   exploration and quantification of the biological effects of weather in a
   rigorous, replicable and comparable way, while also providing a
   benchmark performance to compare other approaches to.}},

   sulfide was quantified using potentiometry with selective electrode and
   the organic matter determination employing an indirect volumetric method
   using potassium dichromate and iron(II) sulfate solutions. The
   bioavailability of the metals was estimated by relationship between the
   concentration of AVS and the sum of the concentrations of the
   simultaneously extracted metals (Sigma SEM), considering a significant
   toxicity when (Sigma SEM)/(AVS) is higher than 1. The bioavailability
   values in the seven stations studied varied from 0.93 to 1.31 (June,
   2014) and from 0.34 to 0.58 (September, 2014). These results
   demonstrated a critical condition of toxicity (bioavailability >1) in
   six of the seven sediment samples collected during the rainy season
   (June, 2014). In the other period (September, 2014), the bioavailability
   was always lower than 1 for all sediment samples collected in the seven
   stations. The individual values of the concentrations of the five metals
   were compared with the parameters PEL (probable effects level) and TEL
   (threshold effects level), which are commonly employed for
   characterization of ecological risk in environmental systems. This
   comparison revealed that all metals have concentrations lower than the
   PEL and only zinc and lead in some stations have contents higher than
   the TEL. The bioavailability evaluation and the concentrations achieved
   for the five elements in the sediments samples analyzed demonstrated
   that the ecosystem studied does not present an environmental risk.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the appropriateness of several methods, including those
   recommended in the Aquatic Guidance Document of the European Food Safety
   Authority (EFSA), for the derivation of chronic Tier-1 regulatory
   acceptable concentrations (RACs) for insecticides and aquatic organisms.
   The insecticides represented different chemical classes
   (organophosphates, pyrethroids, benzoylureas, insect growth regulators,
   biopesticides, carbamates, neonicotinoids, and miscellaneous). Chronic
   Tier-1 RACs derived using toxicity data for the standard species Daphnia
   magna, Chironomus spp., and/or Americamysis bahia, were compared with
   Tier-3 RACs derived from micro-and mesocosm studies on basis of the
   ecological threshold option (ETO-RACs). ETO-RACs could be derived for 31
   insecticides applied to micro-and mesocosms in single or multiple
   applications, yielding a total number of 36 cases for comparison. The
   chronic Tier-1 RACs calculated according to the EFSA approach resulted
   in a sufficient protection level, except for 1 neonicotinoid (slightly
   underprotective) and for several pyrethroids if toxicity data for A.
   bahia were not included. This latter observation can be explained by 1)
   the fact that A. bahia is the most sensitive standard test species for
   pyrethroids, 2) the hydrophobic properties of pyrethroids, and 3) the
   fact that long-term effects observed in (epi) benthic arthropods may be
   better explained by exposure via the sediment than via overlying water.
   Besides including toxicity data for A. bahia, the protection level for
   pyrethroids can be improved by selecting both D. magna and Chironomus
   spp. as standard test species for chronic Tier-1 derivation. Although
   protective in the majority of cases, the conservativeness of the
   recommended chronic Tier-1 RACs appears to be less than an order of
   magnitude for a relatively large proportion of insecticides when
   compared with their Tier-3 ETO-RACs. This may leave limited options for
   refinement of the chronic effect assessment using laboratory toxicity
   data for additional species. (C) 2015 SETAC}},

   10-year-old children}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Background: Low-income communities and communities of color have been
   shown to experience disproportionate exposure to agricultural
   pesticides, which have been linked to poorer neurobehavioral outcomes in
   infants and children. Few studies have assessed health impacts of
   pesticide mixtures in the context of socioeconomic adversity.
   Objectives: To examine associations between residential proximity to
   toxicity-weighted organophosphate (OP) and carbamate pesticide use
   during pregnancy, household- and neighborhood-level poverty during
   childhood, and IQ scores in 10-year-old children.
   Methods: We evaluated associations between both nearby agricultural
   pesticide use and poverty measures and cognitive abilities in
   10-year-old children (n = 501) using data from a longitudinal birth
   cohort study linked with data from the California Pesticide Use
   Reporting system and the American Community Survey. Associations were
   assessed using multivariable linear regression.
   Results: Children of mothers in the highest quartile compared to the
   lowest quartile of proximal pesticide use had lower performance on Full
   Scale IQ {[}beta = -3.0; 95\% Confidence Interval (CI) = (-5.6, -0.3)],
   Perceptual Reasoning {[}beta = -4.0; (-7.6, -0.4)], and Working Memory
   {[}beta = -2.8; (-5.6, -0.1)]. Belonging to a household earning an
   income at or below the poverty threshold was associated with
   approximately two point lower scores on Full Scale IQ Verbal
   Comprehension, and Working Memory. Living in the highest quartile of
   neighborhood poverty at age 10 was associated with approximately four
   point lower performance on Full Scale IQ Verbal Comprehension,
   Perceptual Reasoning, and Working memory.
   Conclusions: Residential proximity to OP and carbamate pesticide use
   during pregnancy and both household- and neighborhood-level poverty
   during childhood were independently associated with poorer cognitive
   functioning in children at 10 years of age. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of soil texture
   on phosphorus (P) extractability and sorption from a wide range of
   calcareous soils across Hamedan, western Iran. Fifty seven soil samples
   were selected and partitioned into five types on the basis of soil
   texture (clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam and mixed loam) and
   the P extracted with calcium chloride (P-CaCl2), citrate (P-citrate),
   HCl (P-HCl), Olsen (P-Ols), and Mehlich-3 (P-M3) solutions. On the
   average, the P extracted was in the order P-HCl > P-M3 > P-citrate >
   P-Ols > P-CaCl2. The P extracted by Pcitrate, PHCl, P-Ols, and P-M3
   methods were significantly higher in sandy, sandy clay loam and sandy
   loamtextures than clay and mixed loam textures, while soil phosphorus
   buffer capacity (PBC) was significantly higher in clay and mixed loam
   soil textures. The correlation analysis revealed a significant positive
   relationship between silt content Freundlich sorption coefficient (K-F),
   maximum P sorption (Q(max)), linear distribution coefficient (K-d), and
   PBC. All extractions were highly correlated with each other and among
   soil components with silt content. The principal component analysis
   (PCA) performed on data identified five principal components describing
   74.5\% of total variation. The results point to soil texture as an
   important factor and that silt was the crucial soil property associated
   with P sorption and its extractability in these calcareous soils.
   DPSM3-2 (P-M3/P-M3+Q(max) x 100) and DPScitrate
   (P-citrate/P-citrate+Q(max) x 100) proved to be good indicators of
   soil's potential P release in these calcareous soils. Among the DPS,
   21\% of soils reported DPSM3-2, values higher than the environmental
   threshold, indicating build-up of P and P release. Most of the studied
   sandy clay loam soils had exceeded the environmentally unacceptable P
   concentration. Various management practices should be taken into account
   to reduce P losses from these soils. Further inorganic and organic P
   fertilizer inputs should be reduced in some parts of studied area. (C)

Volume = {{566}},
Pages = {{1268-1276}},

Abstract = {{There is an urgent need to track how natural systems are responding to
   global change in order to better guide management efforts.
   Traditionally, taxonomically based metrics have been used as indicators
   of ecosystem integrity and conservation status. However, functional
   approaches offer promising advantages that can improve bioassessment
   performance. In this study, we aim to test the applicability of
   functional redundancy (FR), a functional feature related to the
   stability, resistance and resilience of ecosystems, as a tool for
   bioassessment, looking at woody riparian communities in particular. We
   used linear mixed-effect models to investigate the response of FR and
   other traditional biomonitoring indices to natural (drought duration)
   and anthropogenic stress gradients (flow regulation and agriculture) in
   a Mediterranean basin. Such indices include species richness, a
   taxonomic index, and the Riparian Quality Index, which is an index of
   ecological status. Then, we explored the ability of FR and the other
   indices to discriminate between different intensities of human
   alteration. FR showed higher explanatory capacity in response to
   multiple stressors, although we found significant negative relationships
   between all the biological indices (taxonomic, functional and ecological
   quality) and stress gradients. In addition, FR was the most accurate
   index to discriminate among different categories of human alteration in
   both perennial and intermittent river reaches, which allowed us to set
   threshold values to identify undisturbed (reference condition),
   moderately disturbed and highly disturbed reaches in the two types of
   river. Using these thresholds and the best-fitting model, we generated a
   map of human impact on the functional redundancy of riparian communities
   for all the stretches of the river network. Our results demonstrate that
   FR presents clear advantages over traditional methods, which suggests
   that it should be part of the biomonitoring toolbox used for
   environmental management so as to obtain better predictions of ecosystem
   response to environmental changes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Hydrologists and engineers may choose from a range of semidistributed
   rainfall-runoff models such as VIC, PDM, and TOPMODEL, all of which
   predict runoff from a distribution of watershed properties. However,
   these models are not easily compared to event-based data and are missing
   ready-to-use analytical expressions that are analogous to the SCS-CN
   method. The SCS-CN method is an event-based model that describes the
   runoff response with a rainfall-runoff curve that is a function of the
   cumulative storm rainfall and antecedent wetness condition. Here we
   develop an event-based probabilistic storage framework and distill
   semidistributed models into analytical, event-based expressions for
   describing the rainfall-runoff response. The event-based versions called
   VICx, PDMx, and TOPMODELx also are extended with a spatial description
   of the runoff concept of prethreshold and threshold-excess runoff, which
   occur, respectively, before and after infiltration exceeds a storage
   capacity threshold. For total storm rainfall and antecedent wetness
   conditions, the resulting ready-to-use analytical expressions define the
   source areas (fraction of the watershed) that produce runoff by each
   mechanism. They also define the probability density function (PDF)
   representing the spatial variability of runoff depths that are
   cumulative values for the storm duration, and the average unit area
   runoff, which describes the so-called runoff curve. These new
   event-based semidistributed models and the traditional SCS-CN method are
   unified by the same general expression for the runoff curve. Since the
   general runoff curve may incorporate different model distributions, it
   may ease the way for relating such distributions to land use, climate,
   topography, ecology, geology, and other characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Community-based natural resource management groups often develop plans
   with management objectives and conservation goals for specified areas.
   However, assessments of the environmental outcomes achieved by such
   planning initiatives are rare at large scales because of: 1) the lack of
   appropriate data collection and monitoring, 2) difficulty in isolating
   the effects of management actions from external environmental variables,
   and 3) the inherent variability in implementation timing across multiple
   managed areas. We developed a methodology that partially overcomes these
   common barriers. Using a unique time-related measure and trend analysis,
   we tested our methodology with community-based natural resource
   management plans across Illinois along with plant and bird community
   data. We found evidence that community-based natural resource management
   planning is having positive ecological influences across these habitats.
   Effects were most evident for habitat-dependent and area-sensitive bird
   species, and for bird species richness, which showed a positive
   threshold change 78 years post plan implementation. We recommend our
   analytical framework and methods for those working to link management
   actions with ecological change. Our approach is particularly relevant
   for community based natural resource management groups looking to
   implement self-assessment and adaptive management, as well as bridging
   organizations (e.g., state or federal agencies) seeking to assist
   community-based natural resource management groups in management

Abstract = {{The gamma distribution has found extensive applications in the modeling

   U.S. EPA. In addition, estimation of the proportion of samples where the
   measurements exceed a threshold (proportion of non-compliance, for
   example), referred to as an exceedance fraction, is of obvious interest.
   Thus the computation of an accurate upper tolerance limit, and an
   accurate upper confidence limit for the exceedance fraction, are
   important. The problems are somewhat challenging since environmental
   samples are typically not large, and large sample methods cannot be
   used. In the present investigation, we have succeeded in obtaining

Abstract = {{One of the potential environmental issues associated with oil sands
   development is increased ozone formation resulting from NOx and volatile
   organic compound emissions from bitumen extraction, processing and
   upgrading. To manage this issue in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR)
   in northeast Alberta, a regional multi-stakeholder group, the Cumulative
   Environmental Management Association (CEMA), developed an Ozone
   Management Framework that includes a modelling based assessment
   component. In this paper, we describe how the Community Multi-scale Air
   Quality (CMAQ) model was applied to assess potential ground-level ozone
   formation and impacts on ambient air quality and vegetation health for
   three different ozone precursor cases in the AOSR. Statistical analysis
   methods were applied, and the CMAQ performance results met the U.S. EPA
   model performance goal at all sites. The modelled 4th highest daily
   maximum 8-h average ozone concentrations in the base and two future year
   scenarios did not exceed the Canada-wide standard of 65 ppb or the newer
   Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards of 63 ppb in 2015 and 62 ppb in
   2020. Modelled maximum 1-h ozone concentrations in the study were well
   below the Alberta Ambient Air Quality Objective of 82 ppb in all three
   cases. Several ozone vegetation exposure metrics were also evaluated to
   investigate the potential impact of ground level ozone on vegetation.
   The chronic 3-months SUM60 exposure metric is within the CEMA baseline
   range (0-2000 ppb-hr) everywhere in the AOSR. The AOT40 ozone exposure
   metric predicted by CMAQ did not exceed the United Nations Economic
   Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) threshold of concern of 3000 ppb-hr in
   any of the cases but is just below the threshold in high-end future
   emissions scenario. In all three emission scenarios, the CMAQ predicted
   W126 ozone exposure metric is within the CEMA baseline threshold of 4000
   ppb-hr. This study outlines the use of photochemical modelling of the
   impact of an industry (oil sands) on ground-level ozone levels as an air
   quality management tool in the AOSR. It allows an evaluation of the
   relationships between the pollutants emitted to the atmosphere and
   potential ground level ozone concentrations throughout the AOSR thereby
   extending the spatial coverage of the results beyond the monitoring

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Channel morphology is triggered by transport capacity, velocity of
   water, volume and size of the supplied sediment. Changes in grain size,
   critical shear stress and bed roughness can increase transport capacity
   in response to high sediment supply where anthropogenic factors become
   important for fluvial dynamics through removal of bed materials. In a
   stable sand feeding condition, sediment transport may gradually increase
   towards river bed due to the increasing shear stress. When the sediments
   are removed naturally or anthroprogenically from river bed, sand feeding
   condition gets interrupted and generate hungry water. It also reduces
   the shear stress on convex slope. This situation creates an environment
   of sand-gravel mixture. This study aims to find out the relationship
   between grain size and bed shear stress in normal condition and
   depositional changes due to human intervention. Present research work
   has been conducted on three selected mining spots from three courses of
   Kangsabati River i.e. Sarenga (upper course), Mohanpur (middle course)
   and Palaspai (lower course), respectively. DuBoys equation and Shields
   formula (1936) has been taken to explain the mechanisms of shear stress
   and critical shear stress in connection to the course wise variation of
   the transport capacity of sediment in different mining and non-mining
   sites. Flow velocity was measured by floating method. Textural analysis
   of collected sediments was measured by sieve technique and GRADISTAT is
   used to determine the mean, shorting, peakness and skewness and G-STAT
   is used for CM and triangular diagrams of the grain size distribution.
   Result shows that critical shear stress is higher in Sarenga and
   gradually decreases towards Mohanpur and Palaspai. So, sediment erosion
   highly occurs in the upper portion of the basin and relatively lowers in
   lower course. Grain size distribution reveals that most of sediments are
   coarse in nature, well sorted and very leptokurtic in Sarenga while in
   Palaspai sand is medium sized, moderate well sorted and mesokurtic in
   nature. The coarse sediments are deposited by higher threshold value of
   bed mobility in Sarenga while medium particles are deposited due to
   lower threshold value in Mohanpur and Palaspai.}},

   abundance of alkanes was significantly higher in diesel vehicle
   emissions, approximately accounting for 41.1\%-45.2\%, followed by
   aromatics and alkenes. The most abundant species were propene, ethane,
   n-decane, n-undecane, and n-dodecane. The maximum incremental reactivity
   (MIR) method was adopted to evaluate the contributions of individual
   VOCs to OFP. The results indicated that the largest contributors to O-3
   production were alkenes and aromatics, which accounted for
   87.7\%-91.5\%. Propene, ethene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1-butene, and
   1,2,3-trimethylbenzene were the top five VOC species based on their OFP,
   and accounted for 54.0\%-64.8\% of the total OFP. The threshold dilution
   factor was applied to analyze the possibility of VOC stench pollution.
   The majority of stench components emitted from vehicle exhaust were
   aromatics, especially p-diethylbenzene, propylbenzene, m-ethyltoluene,
   and p-ethyltoluene. (C) 2016 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental

Abstract = {{To detect the small island effect (SIE) and nestedness patterns of
   herpetofauna of the West Indies, we derived and updated data on the
   presence/absence of herpetofauna in this region from recently published
   reviews. We applied regression-based analyses, including linear
   regression and piecewise regressions with two and three segments, to
   detect the SIE and then used the Akaike's information criterion (AIC) as
   a criterion to select the best model. We used the NODF (a nestedness
   metric based on overlap and decreasing fill) to quantify nestedness and
   employed two null models to determine significance. Moreover, a random
   sampling effort was made to infer about the degree of nestedness at
   portions of the entire community. We found piecewise regression with
   three segments performed best, suggesting the species-area relationships
   possess three different patterns that resulted from two area thresholds:
   a first one, delimiting the SIE, and a second one, delimiting
   evolutionary processes. We also found that taxa with lower resource
   requirement, higher dispersal ability, and stronger adaptation to the
   environment generally displayed lower corresponding threshold values,
   indicating superior taxonomic groups could earlier end the SIE period
   and start in situ speciation as the increase of island size. Moreover,
   the traditional two-segment piecewise regression method may cause poor
   estimations for both slope and threshold value of the SIE. Therefore, we
   suggest previous SIE detection works that conducted by two-segment
   piecewise regression method, ignoring the possibility of three segments,
   need to be reanalyzed. Antinestedness occurred in the entire system,
   whereas high degree of nestedness could still occur in portions within
   the region. Nestedness may still be applicable to conservation planning
   at portions even if it is antinested at the regional scale. However,
   nestedness may not be applicable to conservation planning at the
   regional scale even if nestedness does exist among sampling islands from
   a portion.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles are considered the most promising alternative to
   internal combustion engine vehicles towards a cleaner transportation
   sector. Having null tailpipe emissions, electric vehicles contribute to
   fight localized pollution, which is particularly important in
   overpopulated urban areas. However, the electric vehicle implies
   greenhouse gas emissions related to its production and to the
   electricity generation needed to charge its batteries. This study
   focuses the analysis on how the electric vehicle emissions vary when
   compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, depending on the
   electric power plant fleet and the efficiency during the use-phase. For
   this to be done, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) associated to the
   electricity generation on the electric vehicle most selling European
   countries are calculated. Similarly, electric vehicle's use-phase energy
   efficiency is calculated under a wide range of driving conditions using
   the Monte Carlo method. The results from energy production and energy
   use phases are compared to the GWP calculated for internal combustion
   engine vehicles for six different driving cycles, to obtain the
   threshold values for which electric vehicles provide GWP reduction.
   These threshold values are then matched with the current electricity
   power plant fleet and the electric vehicle promotion incentives of the
   European countries considered in the study, showing that some countries
   (e.g. France or Norway) are better-suited for electric vehicles
   adoption, while countries like Spain or Portugal should boost electric
   vehicle promotion policies. Furthermore, other countries in Europe, such
   as Germany or the UK that are doing an effort on decarbonizing their
   power plant fleet, do not offer immediate greenhouse gas emission
   reductions for the uptake of electric vehicles instead of conventional
   cars. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: High-content imaging (HCI) allows simultaneous measurement
   of multiple cellular phenotypic changes and is an important tool for
   evaluating the biological activity of chemicals.
   OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to analyze dynamic cellular changes using HCI
   to identify the ``tipping point{''} at which the cells did not show
   recovery towards a normal phenotypic state.
   METHODS: HCI was used to evaluate the effects of 967 chemicals (in
   concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 200 mu M) on HepG2 cells over a 72-hr
   exposure period. The HCI end points included p53, c-Jun, histone H2A. x,
   alpha-tubulin, histone H3, alpha tubulin, mitochondrial membrane
   potential, mitochondrial mass, cell cycle arrest, nuclear size, and cell
   number. A computational model was developed to interpret HCI responses
   as cell-state trajectories.
   RESULTS: Analysis of cell-state trajectories showed that 336 chemicals
   produced tipping points and that HepG2 cells were resilient to the
   effects of 334 chemicals up to the highest concentration (200 mu M) and
   duration (72 hr) tested. Tipping points were identified as
   concentration-dependent transitions in system recovery, and the
   corresponding critical concentrations were generally between 5 and 15
   times (25th and 75th percentiles, respectively) lower than the
   concentration that produced any significant effect on HepG2 cells. The
   remaining 297 chemicals require more data before they can be placed in
   either of these categories.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings show the utility of HCI data for
   reconstructing cell state trajectories and provide insight into the
   adaptation and resilience of in vitro cellular systems based on tipping
   points. Cellular tipping points could be used to define a point of
   departure for risk-based prioritization of environmental chemicals.}},

   Biodegradability of the drugs solutions was enhanced reaching BOD5/COD
   ratios close to the biodegradability threshold of 0.4, evidencing the
   formation of bio-compatible by-products (mainly short chain carboxylic
   acids) which are suitable for biological post-treatment. Moreover,
   toxicity evaluation by the Microtox (R) method revealed that EF
   pre-treatment was able of detoxifying both, FRSM and RNTD solutions,
   constituting another indicator of biodegradability of EF treated
   solutions. In the second stage, electrolyzed solutions were treated by
   means of an aerobic biological process. A significant part of the

Abstract = {{The availability of the primary limiting nutrient plays a major role in
   driving the productivity, biomass and community composition of coastal
   phytoplankton, but there is an ongoing challenge to define the
   relationship between nutrient enrichment and phytoplankton response.
   This study explored a new indicator (N95) for quantifying nutrient
   response in natural phytoplankton communities. In this study, N95
   specifically represented the required nitrogen addition (normalised to
   chlorophyll a) for the sampled phytoplankton population to reach 95\% of
   nitrogenreplete photosynthetic efficiency. To calculate N95, an
   asymptotic model was applied to measures of phytoplankton photosynthetic
   efficiency (F-v/F-m) taken after 24 h incubations under a range of
   nitrogen enrichment treatments. Applying the method in an Australian
   subtropical bay, Moreton Bay, nitrogen response was lowest nearshore and
   high, yet variable, offshore. This pattern reflected the ambient
   nutrient gradient of declining concentrations with distance offshore. A
   Moreton Bay-specific threshold in phytoplankton nutrient response was
   identified at the ambient dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration of
   2 mu mol l(-1), above which the response to nitrogen enrichment did not
   increase for 82\% of samples. Advantages to measuring N95 were that
   incubations were simple to set up, incubation period was short, and
   F-v/F-m measures were simple to make. This approach advances options for
   using F-v/F-m measures to assess phytoplankton nutrient response and
   provides a new and sensitive biological indicator applicable to
   long-term water quality monitoring programs, relevant to parameterising
   ecological models and supporting decision making on nutrient management.}},

Abstract = {{In China and India, income growth is driving a structural change in

   consumers to explore potential for environmental labelling of lamb meat
   in emerging economies to form part of agri-environmental response to
   these pressures. Choice experiments are a stated-preference nonmarket

   presented with differing hypothetical products described by attributes
   describing environmental certification standards, with observed choices
   and product attributes analysed in a probabilistic Random Utility Model
   econometric framework. While preference disparities are found between
   emerging and developed economy consumers, results demonstrate that
   emerging economy consumers' choice of lamb products can be influenced by
   production processes that incorporate environmental sustainability.
   Indian consumers are found to be willing to pay relatively more for

Abstract = {{A common strategy for recovering endangered species is ensuring that
   populations exceed the minimum viable population size (MVP), a
   demographic benchmark that theoretically ensures low long-term
   extinction risk. One method of establishing MVP is population viability
   analysis, a modeling technique that simulates population trajectories
   and forecasts extinction risk based on a series of biological,
   environmental, and management assumptions. Such models also help
   identify key uncertainties that have a large influence on extinction
   risk. We used stochastic count-based simulation models to explore
   extinction risk, MVP, and the possible benefits of alternative
   management strategies in populations of Roanoke logperch Percina rex, an
   endangered stream fish. Estimates of extinction risk were sensitive to
   the assumed population growth rate and model type, carrying capacity,
   and catastrophe regime (frequency and severity of anthropogenic fish
   kills), whereas demographic augmentation did little to reduce extinction
   risk. Under density-dependent growth, the estimated MVP for Roanoke
   logperch ranged from 200 to 4200 individuals, depending on the assumed
   severity of catastrophes. Thus, depending on the MVP threshold, anywhere
   from two to all five of the logperch populations we assessed were
   projected to be viable. Despite this uncertainty, these results help
   identify populations with the greatest relative extinction risk, as well
   as management strategies that might reduce this risk the most, such as
   increasing carrying capacity and reducing fish kills. Better estimates
   of population growth parameters and catastrophe regimes would facilitate
   the refinement of MVP and extinction-risk estimates, and they should be
   a high priority for future research on Roanoke logperch and other

   Objective The influences of population, economic and spatial development
   during the urbanization process in Beijing City, China on net primary
   productivity (NPP) were analyzed. The responding mechanism of NPP in
   different urbanization stages was also examined to develop advice about
   eco-environmental sustainability of urban development.
   Methods Using the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach model, we estimated
   NPP. Using linear regression and polynomial regression analysis, we
   analyzed NPP responses to stages of urbanization.
   Results High NPP areas were located in northeast Yanqing, northwest
   Miyun, northern Huairou and Pinggu. The distribution of NPP generally
   occurred in the following order from high NPP to low NPP: outer suburbs,
   inner suburbs, encircled city center, and inner city. Because of the
   heat island effect in winter, the estimated NPP in the encircled city
   center and inner city was higher in 2009 than in 2001. There was a
   negative correlation between NPP and both economic and spatial
   urbanization, but an increase in population did not necessarily lead to
   an immediate decrease in NPP. An analysis of NPP dynamics in five kinds
   of urban development zones showed that urbanization resulted in a
   lasting and observable loss of NPP over time and space, although there
   was some promotion of NPP in highly urbanized zones.
   Conclusion There are three stages in the response of NPP to
   urbanization: damage stage, antagonistic stage, and coordination stage.
   The stage threshold depends on local eco-environmental management and

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Modern toxicology is shifting from an observational to a
   mechanistic science. As part of this shift, high-throughput toxicity
   assays are being developed using alternative, nonmammalian species to
   prioritize chemicals and develop prediction models of human toxicity.
   METHODS: The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) was used to
   screen the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) ToxCast Phase
   I and Phase II libraries, which contain 292 and 676 chemicals,
   respectively, for chemicals leading to decreased larval development and
   growth. Chemical toxicity was evaluated using three parameters: a
   biologically defined effect size threshold, half-maximal activity
   concentration (AC(50)), and lowest effective concentration (LEC).
   RESULTS: Across both the Phase I and Phase II libraries, 62\% of the
   chemicals were classified as active <= 200 mu M in the C. elegans assay.
   Chemical activities and potencies in C. elegans were compared with those
   from two zebrafish embryonic development toxicity studies and
   developmental toxicity data for rats and rabbits. Concordance of
   chemical activity was higher between C. elegans and one zebrafish assay
   across Phase I chemicals (79\%) than with a second zebrafish assay
   (59\%). Using C. elegans or zebrafish to predict rat or rabbit
   developmental toxicity resulted in balanced accuracies (the average
   value of the sensitivity and specificity for an assay) ranging from 45\%
   to 53\%, slightly lower than the concordance between rat and rabbit
   (58\%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present an assay that quantitatively and reliably
   describes the effects of chemical toxicants on C. elegans growth and
   development. We found significant overlap in the activity of chemicals
   in the ToxCast T libraries between C. elegans and zebrafish
   developmental screens. Incorporating C. elegans toxicological assays as
   part of a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays provides additional
   information for the development of models to predict a chemical's
   potential toxicity to humans.}},

   concentration, assessing the uncertainty associated with mapping and
   delineating areas having As concentration higher than a defined trigger
   value. The cities of Tampere and Lahti are located in the natural
   geochemical As provinces where most of the As in the baseline mapping
   samples has a geogenic source. A geostatistical approach was used to
   assess the spatial variability of As and turning bands method to draw a
   series of stochastic realizations. The differences between realizations
   provided a measure of spatial uncertainty and allowed the assessment of
   the probability that As concentration exceeds a critical threshold.
   Results showed a short-range component in the variogram model for Lahti
   that may be related to anthropogenic sources of As as well. Arsenic
   concentrations are generally higher in Tampere than in Lahti due to its
   high natural concentrations in bedrock and soil. The widespread
   anthropogenic short-range component was not observed in Tampere while
   misting up with natural As concentration because of the natural level of
   As in the soil. The upper limit of the baseline variation values for
   Tampere (15 mg kg(-1)) and Lahti (6 mg kg(-1)) is suggested as regional
   trigger value for assessment of soil contamination and remediation
   needs. The results show that geostatistical analysis with stochastic
   simulations could be adopted to delineate other areas where lower or
   higher trigger values could be used.}},

Abstract = {{Within the scope of the renewal of industrial operating permits in
   Belgium, the Walloon Agency for Air and Climate needed air quality
   criteria for a wide range of toxics. Due to the plethora of different
   existing values for some compounds or the total lack for others, the
   development of a simple methodology was required to provide both quality
   and intervention criteria, corresponding respectively to a chemical
   concentration for which no adverse health effects are expected for a
   lifetime exposure, and the chemical concentration in air associated with
   a risk for human health deemed significant. The tiered methodology
   developed here allows the selection of air guidelines from available
   databases, and proposes, if needed, approaches based on well-proven
   procedures to derive air quality guidelines from occupational exposure
   limits, drinking water guidelines, tolerable daily intakes, or as a last
   resort acute lethal toxicity data if nothing else is available. If this
   method has been successfully applied to more than 550 compounds, all
   values produced should be validated according to the purpose of the
   guidelines, the technical feasibility of achieving the threshold
   produced, and the specificity of the environment conditions and the

Volume = {{188}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Heavy metals enriched agricultural soils have been the subject of great
   concern because these metals have potential to be transferred to the
   soil solution and afterward accumulated in food chain. To study the
   trace metal persistence in crop soil, 90 representative soil samples
   were collected and analyzed for heavy metal (As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb,
   and Zn) and anions (chloride, nitrates, phosphates and sulfates).
   Cluster and factor analysis techniques were used for the source
   identification of these excessive heavy metal levels and ecological risk
   was determined with potential ecological risk assessment. The degree of
   enrichment of eight studied heavy metals in comparison with the
   corresponding background levels decreased in order: Cd > Pb > Fe > Ni >
   Mn > As > Cu similar to Zn. Arsenic and cadmium exhibited 1.30- and
   1.64-fold exceeded levels than threshold limits set by National
   environment quality standards, respectively. Cd in cotton field's soil
   may lead to higher potential risk than other heavy metals. On overall
   basis, the cumulative mean potential ecological risk for the district
   (207.75) corresponded to moderate risk level with higher contributions
   from As and Pb especially from Cd. Cadmium formed strong positive
   correlation with phosphate content of soil at p < 0.01. Cluster analysis
   indicated that Cluster 1 (extremely polluted) probably originated from
   anthropogenic inputs of phosphate fertilizer and past usage of arsenical
   pesticides.}},

   Secondly, we investigate the screening threshold with a quantitative

   methodologies to three hydrological models with varying complexity

   demonstrate that convergence of screening and ranking can be reached

Abstract = {{The main objective of the present study was to derive ecologically
   relevant effect threshold concentrations of (dissolved) Pb for selected
   European Union (EU) freshwater rivers, using the 2008 EU Voluntary Risk
   Assessment Report as a starting point and more advanced methodologies
   than those used in the Voluntary Risk Assessment Report. This included
   1) implementing more robust quality criteria for selecting chronic
   toxicity data; 2) the conversion of total to dissolved Pb concentrations
   using a combination of an empirical equation relating inorganic Pb
   solubility and geochemical speciation modeling to account for effects of
   dissolved organic matter; 3) the use of bioavailability models for
   chronic toxicity for species belonging to 3 different trophic levels;
   and 4) the use of robust methods for large data set handling (such as
   species sensitivity distribution {[}SSD] analysis). The authors used
   published bioavailability models for an algal species
   (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and a daphnid (Ceriodaphnia dubia) and
   developed a new model for the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). The
   research has shown that these models are also useful for, and reasonably
   accurate in, predicting chronic toxicity to other species, including a
   snail, a rotifer, midge larvae, and an aquatic plant (read-across). A
   comprehensive chronic toxicity data set for Pb was compiled, comprising
   159 individual high-quality toxicity data for 25 different species. By
   applying the total dissolved conversion and the bioavailability models,
   normalized toxicity values were obtained, which were then entered into a
   SSD analysis. Based on the parametric best-fitting SSDs, the authors
   calculated that ecological threshold concentrations of Pb protecting
   95\% of freshwater species for 7 selected European freshwater scenarios
   were between 6.3 mu g dissolved Pb/L and 31.1 mu g dissolved Pb/L. (C)

   environments}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{32-41}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to estimate background concentrations of
   organometallic compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT), dibutyltin (DBT),
   monobutyltin (MBT), triphenyltin (TPhT), diphenyltin (DPhT),
   monophenyltin (MPhT), methylmercury (MeHg), inorganic mercury (iHg) and
   diethyllead (Et2Pb) in the aquatic environment at the French national
   scale.
   Both water and sediment samples were collected all over the country,
   resulting in 152 water samples and 123 sediment samples collected at 181
   sampling points. Three types of surface water bodies were investigated:
   rivers (140 sites), lakes (19 sites) and coastal water (42 sites),
   spread along the 11 French river basins. The choice of sites was made on
   the basis of previous investigation results and the following target
   criteria: reference, urban sites, agricultural and industrial areas. The
   analytical method was properly validated for both matrices prior to
   analysis, resulting in low limits of quantification (LOQ), good
   precision and linearity in agreement with the Water Framework Directive
   demands. The results were first evaluated as a function of their river
   basins, type of surrounding pressure and water bodies. Later, background
   concentrations at the French national scale were established for both
   water and sediment matrices, as well as their threshold, i.e., the
   concentration that distinguishes background from anomalies or
   contaminations. Background concentrations in water are ranging between
   <0.04-0.14 ng Hg. L-1 for MeHg, <0.14-2.10 ng Hg. L-1 for iHg, <1.0-8.43
   ng Pb. L-1 for Et2Pb and 0.49-151 ng Sn. L-1, <0.08 -3.04 ng Sn. L-1 and
   <0.08-0.25 ng Sn. L-1 for MBT, DBT and TBT, respectively. For sediments,
   background concentrations were set as <0.09-1.11 ng Hg. g(-1) for MeHg,
   <0.06-24.3 ng Pb. g(-1) for Et2Pb and <1.4-13.4 ng Sn. g(-1), <0.82-8.54
   ng Sn. g(-1), <0.25-1.16 ng Sn. g(-1) and <0.08-0.61 ng Sn. g(-1) for
   MBT, DBT, TBT and DPhT, respectively. TBT occurs in higher
   concentrations than the available environmental protection values in 24
   and 38 sampling sites for both water and sediment samples, respectively.
   Other phenyltins (MPhT and TPhT) did not occur above their LOQ and
   therefore no background was possible to establish. Throughout this work,
   which is the first assessment of background concentrations for
   organometallic compounds at the French national level ever being
   published, it was possible to conclude that over the last 10-20 years
   organotin concentrations in French river basins have decreased while
   MeHg concentration remained stable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{10-17}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The ambitious objective pursued by the European Water Framework
   Directive (WFD) is good status for all European waters. However, ``less
   stringent environmental objectives{''} are permissible if the costs of
   achieving good status are disproportionately high. This exemption, if
   abused, carries the risk of watering down the ambitions of the
   Directive. Currently, no transparent, well-established, universally
   applicable method for routinely testing disproportionality exists
   throughout Europe. In this paper, such a method is developed for surface
   water bodies. The core idea is to determine a water body-specific
   disproportionality threshold which is then compared to the projected
   costs of achieving ``good status/potential{''}. For the sake of
   practicability, the benchmark for disproportionality is estimated on the
   basis of prior expenditure on water quality enhancement. The paper
   argues that the proposed method combines both possible interpretations
   of (dis-) proportionality affordability and cost-benefit considerations.
   Due to the method's moderate data requirements it can be used readily in
   most German federal states and is transferable in principle to other EU
   Member States. The method was tested empirically for a river in the
   German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Permanently increasing number of industrial and municipal wastes
   accumulated in the dumps, inevitably leads to contamination of soils,
   surface waters and subterranean waters, the atmosphere and is a
   perceptible factor of climate change on our planet.
   This paper is one more proof that waste utilization, as a valuable
   source of components for new materials production, is environmentally
   and economically the best way for their management.
   The purposes of the research were the next: to develop eco-friendly
   ceramics that include and immobilize hazardous laundry sludge after
   cleaning of extremely polluted industrial uniforms with high contents of
   As, Ba, Cd, Pb, Cr, Hg, Cu, Zn and grease, oil, resin, tar, paints,
   organic volatile compounds, etc.; to improve the mechanical properties
   of red ceramic, using laundry sludge; to demonstrate a possibility of
   natural raw materials extraction decrease, partially replacing them with
   laundry sludge. This sludge was introduced in the traditional clay-sand
   mix in the amount of 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 wt. \%. After sintering
   of these composites at temperatures 1000 degrees, 1050 degrees, 1100
   degrees, 1150 degrees C the maximum values of flexural strength
   resistance of the ceramics was 15.6 MPa, values of linear shrinkage
   ranged from 4.5 to 14.1\%, water absorption values - from 13.0 to
   20.3\%, and density values ranged from 1.65 to 1.83 g/cm(3). All these
   characteristics of the mechanical properties of the developed materials
   significantly exceed the properties of ceramics from traditional
   clay-sand mixes without laundry sludge. The leaching and solubility
   values of the heavy metals immobilized within these ceramics are
   hundreds of times lower than threshold levels set by the national
   standards of Brazil. This study showed that industrial laundry sludge
   can be safely used as additive to ceramics in proportions of 10-20\% wt.

Abstract = {{Recently, environmental metabolomics has been introduced as a next
   generation environmental toxicity method which helps in evaluating
   toxicity of bioactive compounds to non-target organisms. In general,
   efficient metabolite extraction from target cells is one of the keys to
   success to better understand the effects of toxic substances to
   organisms. In this regard, the aim of this study is (1) to compare two
   sample extraction methods in terms of abundance and quality of
   metabolites and (2) investigate how this could lead to difference in
   data interpretation using pathway analysis. For this purpose, the
   antibiotic sulfamethazine and zebrafish (Danio rerio) were selected as
   model toxic substance and target organism, respectively. The zebrafish
   was exposed to four different sulfamethazine concentrations (0, 10, 30,
   and 50 mg/L) for 72 h. Metabolites were extracted using two different
   methods (Bligh and Dyer and solid phase extraction). A total of 13,538
   and 12,469 features were detected using quadrupole time-of-flight liquid
   chromatography mass spectrometry (QTOF LC-MS). Of these metabolites,
   4278 (Bligh and Dyer) and 332 (solid phase extraction) were found to be
   significant after false discovery rate adjustment at a significance
   threshold of 0.01. Metlin and KEGG pathway analysis showed comprehensive
   information from fish samples extracted using Bligh and Dyer compared to
   solid phase extraction. This study shows that proper selection of sample
   extraction method is critically important for interpreting and analyzing
   the toxicity data of organisms when metabolomics is applied. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Microbial populations can be dispersal limited. However, microorganisms

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Scientists and resource managers often use methods and tools that assume
   ecosystem components respond linearly to environmental drivers and human
   stressors. However, a growing body of literature demonstrates that many
   relationships are non-linear, where small changes in a driver prompt a
   disproportionately large ecological response. We aim to provide a
   comprehensive assessment of the relationships between drivers and
   ecosystem components to identify where and when non-linearities are
   likely to occur. We focused our analyses on one of the best-studied
   marine systems, pelagic ecosystems, which allowed us to apply robust
   statistical techniques on a large pool of previously published studies.
   In this synthesis, we (1) conduct a wide literature review on single
   driver-response relationships in pelagic systems, (2) use statistical
   models to identify the degree of non-linearity in these relationships,
   and (3) assess whether general patterns exist in the strengths and
   shapes of non-linear relationships across drivers. Overall we found that
   non-linearities are common in pelagic ecosystems, comprising at least
   52\% of all driver-response relationships. This is likely an
   underestimate, as papers with higher quality data and analytical
   approaches reported non-linear relationships at a higher frequency (on
   average 11\% more). Consequently, in the absence of evidence for a
   linear relationship, it is safer to assume a relationship is non-linear.
   Strong non-linearities can lead to greater ecological and socioeconomic
   consequences if they are unknown (and/or unanticipated), but if known
   they may provide clear thresholds to inform management targets. In
   pelagic systems, strongly non-linear relationships are often driven by
   climate and trophodynamic variables but are also associated with local
   stressors, such as overfishing and pollution, that can be more easily
   controlled by managers. Even when marine resource managers cannot
   influence ecosystem change, they can use information about threshold
   responses to guide how other stressors are managed and to adapt to new
   ocean conditions. As methods to detect and reduce uncertainty around
   threshold values improve, managers will be able to better understand and
   account for ubiquitous non-linear relationships.}},

   associated with a higher risk of mortality during heat waves. The use of
   certain neuroleptic medications to control some of this disease's
   complications would appear to be related to an increase in heat-related
   mortality. Objective: To analyse the relationship and quantify the
   short-term effect of high temperatures during heat wave episodes in
   Madrid on daily mortality and PD-related hospital admissions.
   Methods: We used an ecological time-series study and fit Poisson
   regression models. We analysed the daily number of deaths due to PD and
   the number of daily PD-related emergency hospital admissions in the city
   of Madrid, using maximum daily temperature (C) as the main environmental
   variable and chemical air pollution as covariates. We controlled for
   trend, seasonalities, and the autoregressive nature of the series.
   Results: There was a maximum daily temperature of 30 degrees C at which
   PD-related admissions were at a minimum. Similarly, a temperature of 34
   degrees C coincides with an increase in the number of admissions. For
   PD-related admissions, the Relative Risk (RR) for every increase of 1
   degrees C above the threshold temperature was 1.13 IC95\%: (1.03-1.23)
   at lags 1 and 5; and for daily PD-related mortality, the RR was 1.14
   IC95\%: (1.01-1.28) at lag 3.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that suffering from PD is a risk factor
   that contributes to the excess morbidity and mortality associated with
   high temperatures, and is relevant from the standpoint of public health
   prevention plans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes methods to detect outliers in functional data sets
   and the task of identifying atypical curves is carried out using the
   recently proposed kernelized functional spatial depth (KFSD). KFSD is a
   local depth that can be used to order the curves of a sample from the
   most to the least central, and since outliers are usually among the
   least central curves, we present a probabilistic result which allows to
   select a threshold value for KFSD such that curves with depth values
   lower than the threshold are detected as outliers. Based on this result,
   we propose three new outlier detection procedures. The results of a
   simulation study show that our proposals generally outperform a battery
   of competitors. We apply our procedures to a real data set consisting in
   daily curves of emission levels of nitrogen oxides (NO) since it is of
   interest to identify abnormal NO levels to take necessary environmental
   political actions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Post-Pleistocene diversification of threespine stickleback
   in fresh water offers a valuable opportunity to study how changes in
   environmental salinity shape physiological evolution in fish. In Alaska,
   the presence of both ancestral oceanic populations and derived
   landlocked populations, including recent lake introductions, allows us
   to examine rates and direction of evolution of osmoregulation following
   halohabitat transition.
   Hypotheses: Strong selection for enhanced freshwater tolerance will
   improve survival of recently lake-introduced stickleback in ion-poor
   conditions compared with their oceanic ancestors. Trade-offs between
   osmoregulation in fresh water and seawater will allow members of the
   ancestral population to survive better in response to seawater
   challenge, as mediated by upregulating salt-secreting transporters in
   the gill. Poorer hypo-osmoregulatory performance of derived fish will be
   marked by higher levels of taurine and other organic osmolytes.
   Methods: We reared clutches at a common salinity from an anadromous and
   a descendant population, Scout Lake, which has been landlocked for only
   two generations. We challenged 6-week-old juveniles with extreme low and
   high salinity treatments and sampled fish over 10 days to investigate
   putative molecular mechanisms underlying differences in halotolerance.
   We measured whole-body organic osmolyte content as well as gill
   Na+-/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity and Na+/K+/2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC)
   protein abundance. Other juveniles from these populations and also from
   Cheney Lake, a fourth-generation landlocked descendant, were gradually
   salt-acclimated to determine maximum halotolerance limits.
   Results: Scout Lake stickleback exhibited 67\% higher survival in fresh
   water than the ancestral anadromous population, but individuals from
   both groups exhibited similar seawater tolerance. Likewise, the gradual
   salinity threshold for each population was equivalent (71 ppt). Gill NKA
   activity and NKCC abundance were both higher in seawater-challenged
   fish, but did not differ between populations. Sticklebacks from both
   populations responded to acute salinity stress by transiently increasing
   osmolyte levels in seawater and decreasing them in fresh water.
   Conclusion: Enhanced freshwater tolerance has evolved rapidly in
   recently landlocked stickleback compared with their anadromous ancestors
   (0.569 haldanes), but the former have retained ancestral
   seawater-osmoregulatory function.}},

Title = {{Making environmental assessments of biomass production systems

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Global demand for agricultural and forestry products fundamentally
   affects regional land-use change associated with environmental impacts
   (EIs) such as erosion. In contrast to aggregated global metrics such as
   greenhouse gas (GHG) balances, local/regional EIs of different
   agricultural and forestry production regions need methods which enable
   worldwide EI comparisons. The key aspect is to control environmental
   heterogeneity to reveal man-made differences of EIs between production
   regions. Environmental heterogeneity is the variation in biotic and
   abiotic environmental conditions. In the present study, we used three
   approaches to control environmental heterogeneity: (i) environmental
   stratification, (ii) potential natural vegetation (PNV), and (iii)
   regional environmental thresholds to compare EIs of solid biomass
   production. We compared production regions of managed forests and
   plantation forests in subtropical (Satilla watershed, Southeastern US),
   tropical (Rufiji basin, Tanzania), and temperate (Mulde watershed,
   Central Germany) climates. All approaches supported the comparison of
   the EIs of different land-use classes between and within production
   regions. They also standardized the different EIs for a comparison
   between the EI categories. The EIs for different land-use classes within
   a production region decreased with increasing degree of naturalness
   (forest, plantation forestry, and cropland). PNV was the most reliable
   approach, but lacked feasibility and relevance. The PNV approach
   explicitly included most of the factors that drive environmental
   heterogeneity in contrast to the stratification and threshold
   approaches. The stratification approach allows consistent global
   application due to available data. Regional environmental thresholds
   only included arbitrarily selected aspects of environmental
   heterogeneity; they are only available for few EIs. Especially, the PNV
   and stratification approaches are options to compare regional EIs of
   biomass or crop production such as erosion, biodiversity, or water
   quality impacts worldwide and thereby complement existing metrics
   assessing global EIs such as GHG emissions.}},

Abstract = {{To understand and a predict a coastal water quality system, a
   data-driven statistical model has been proposed using the Bayesian
   method and applied to the Saemangeum tidal lake. To describe a coastal
   water quality system, a multivariate statistical model was derived by
   determining observed variables and their interrelationships such as sea
   surface temperature, salinity, Chl-a, DO, pH, TN, TP, COD, NH4N, NO2N,
   NO3N, PO4O, and SiO2Si for parameters of coastal marine environments,
   coastal water quality, and nutrients using observed field data. To
   estimate this statistical model, a Bayesian approach using Markov chain
   Monte Carlo method was applied to identify an optima] data-driven model.
   There are no limitations of statistical assumptions for samples using
   the Bayesian method, which is required in a frequentist approach, such
   as the maximum likelihood method. The Saemangeum tidal lake's coastal
   water quality system was quantitatively described and assessed by
   interpreting coefficients of model parameters with relation among
   variables from a derived structural equation model. Moreover, a
   prediction for coastal management was possible by Bayesian inference.
   Thus, there are new findings on the salinity threshold necessary to
   maintain optimal water by improving degraded water quality. Based on the
   findings, a quantity of water mixing (exchaning fresh water through
   sluice gates) can be applied while continuing construction of land

Abstract = {{Context An increase in the incidence of large wildfires worldwide has
   prompted concerns about the resilience of forest ecosystems,
   particularly in the western U.S., where recent changes are linked with
   climate warming and 20th-century land management practices.
   Objectives To study forest resilience to recent wildfires, we examined
   relationships among fire legacies, landscape features, ecological
   conditions, and patterns of post-fire conifer regeneration. Methods We
   quantified regeneration across 182 sites in 21 recent large fires in dry
   mixed-conifer forests of the U.S. northern Rockies. We used logistic and
   negative binomial regression to predict the probability of establishment
   and abundance of conifers 5-13 years post-fire.
   Results Seedling densities varied widely across all sites (0-127,500
   seedlings ha -1) and were best explained by variability in distance to
   live seed sources (b = -0.014, p = 0.002) and pre-fire tree basal area
   (b = 0.072, p = 0.008). Beyond 95 m from the nearest live seed source,
   the probability of seedling establishment was low. Across all the fires
   we studied, 75 \% of the burned area with high tree mortality was within
   this 95-m threshold, suggesting the presence of live seed trees to
   facilitate natural regeneration.
   Conclusions Combined with the mix of species present within the burn
   mosaic, dry mixed-conifer forests will be resilient to large fires
   across our study region, provided that seedlings survive, fire do not
   become more frequent, high-severity patches do not get significantly
   larger, and post-fire climate conditions remain suitable for seedling
   establishment and survival.}},

Abstract = {{Recreational water quality surveillance involves comparing bacterial

   parameters most closely correlated with exceedance probabilities. The
   analysis was based on 7,422 historical sample data points from the years
   2000-2010 for 15 South Florida beach sample sites. Probability analyses
   showed which beaches in the dataset were most susceptible to

   regression analyses found that among the environmental parameters
   evaluated, tide was most closely associated with exceedances, with
   exceedances 2.475 times more likely to occur at high tide compared to
   low tide. The logistic regression methodology proved useful for

Abstract = {{Both open pit mine and smelter projects can have significant impacts on
   a variety of environmental resources. Among these, air quality of the
   surroundings is a key issue. Additionally, the environmental assessment
   of projects demands integrated approach taking in account all pollution
   sources. Therefore, specific focus has been put on the methodology for
   assessing impacts on air quality. This paper proposes an integrated
   index of environmental impact aiming to quantify the air quality impact
   of industrial operations around an urban area, in case of scarcity of in
   situ acquired data. This proposed pollution index is demonstrated by a
   case study conducted in the municipality of Congonhas, Brazil, in which
   contributions of five open pit mines and two smelters were studied. To
   achieve the pollution index, the wind rose and distances from the
   centroids of effective areas to the urban nucleus itself were
   considered, taking into account the wind projection areas from windward
   impacting sources on the leeward impacted urban site. The proposed index
   also includes the squared wind speed (proportional to the kinetic energy
   transferred in uplifting dust from ground surface). The method proposed
   is considered suitable for impact assignment for each one of the air
   pollution sources in the neighborhood of studied area. Some fluid
   dynamic aspects of airborne particulate matter are also studied by
   proposing a new equation for threshold saltation speed.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity conservation in landscapes undergoing climate and land-use
   changes requires designing multipurpose habitat networks that connect
   the movements of organisms at multiple spatial scales. Short-range
   connectivity within habitat networks provides organisms access to
   spatially distributed resources, reduces local extinctions and increases
   recolonization of habitat fragments. Long-range connectivity across
   habitat networks facilitates annual migrations and climate-driven range
   shifts. We present a method for identifying a multipurpose network of
   forest patches that promotes both short- and long-range connectivity.
   Our method uses both graph-theoretic analyses that quantify network
   connectedness and circuit-based analyses that quantify network
   traversability as the basis for identifying spatial conservation
   priorities on the landscape. We illustrate our approach in the
   agroecosystem, bordered by the Laurentian and Appalachian mountain
   ranges, that surrounds the metropolis of Montreal, Canada. We
   established forest conservation priorities for the ovenbird, a
   Neotropical migrant, sensitive to habitat fragmentation that breeds in
   our study area. All connectivity analyses were based on the same
   empirically informed resistance surface for ovenbird, but habitat pixels
   that facilitated short- and long-range connectivity requirements had low
   spatial correlation. The trade-off between connectivity requirements in
   the final ranking of conservation priorities showed a pattern of
   diminishing returns such that beyond a threshold, additional
   conservation of long-range connectivity had decreased effectiveness on
   the conservation of short-range connectivity. Highest conservation
   priority was assigned to a series of stepping stone forest patches
   across the study area that promote traversability between the bordering
   mountain ranges and to a collection of small forest fragments scattered
   throughout the study area that provide connectivity within the
   agroecosystem. Landscape connectivity is important for the ecology and
   genetics of populations threatened by climate change and habitat
   fragmentation. Our method has been illustrated as a means to conserve
   two critical dimensions of connectivity for a single species, but it is
   designed to incorporate a variety of connectivity requirements for many
   species. Our approach can be tailored to local, regional and continental
   conservation initiatives to protect essential species movements that
   will allow biodiversity to persist in a changing climate.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Extreme heat is a public health challenge. The scarcity of
   directly comparable studies on the association of heat with morbidity
   and mortality and the inconsistent identification of threshold
   temperatures for severe impacts hampers the development of comprehensive
   strategies aimed at reducing adverse heat-health events.
   OBJECTIVES: This quantitative study was designed to link temperature
   with mortality and morbidity events in Maricopa County, Arizona, USA,
   with a focus on the summer season.
   METHODS: Using Poisson regression models that controlled for temporal
   confounders, we assessed daily temperature-health associations for a
   suite of mortality and morbidity events, diagnoses, and temperature
   metrics. Minimum risk temperatures, increasing risk temperatures, and
   excess risk temperatures were statistically identified to represent
   different ``trigger points{''} at which heat-health intervention
   measures might be activated.
   RESULTS: We found significant and consistent associations of high
   environmental temperature with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular
   mortality, heat-related mortality, and mortality resulting from
   conditions that are consequences of heat and dehydration.
   Hospitalizations and emergency department visits due to heat-related
   conditions and conditions associated with consequences of heat and
   dehydration were also strongly associated with high temperatures, and
   there were several times more of those events than there were deaths.
   For each temperature metric, we observed large contrasts in trigger
   points (up to 22 degrees C) across multiple health events and diagnoses.
   CONCLUSION: Consideration of multiple health events and diagnoses
   together with a comprehensive approach to identifying threshold
   temperatures revealed large differences in trigger points for possible
   interventions related to heat. Providing an array of heat trigger points
   applicable for different end-users may improve the public health
   response to a problem that is projected to worsen in the coming decades.}},

Abstract = {{Species Distribution Models (SDM) are currently common currency as
   proxies of species distribution range, and using consensus among
   different algorithms is becoming the latest tendency. This information
   is frequently used to estimate conservation status or for conservation
   planning. Nonetheless, different algorithms have huge variation in the
   outcomes. Usually experts determine whether or not a model is accurate,
   often followed by a trimming process. However, this accuracy estimation
   cannot be reproduced. Using Mexican endemic amphibians we evaluate the
   performance of nine modelling algorithms (Artificial Neural Networks,
   Classification Tree Analysis, Flexible Discriminant Analysis,
   Generalised Boosting Model, Generalised Linear Models, Multiple Adaptive
   Regression Splines, MaxEnt, RandomForest, Surface Range Envelope), their
   strict geographic consensus, locality records and simple convex-hull
   areas through comparison of: (1) their presence/absence within Mexico's
   governmental protected areas, (2) range sizes projected, and (3)
   differences in estimated richness by all methods. We conducted all good
   practices prior modelling but removed the trimming factor after
   modelling to make the process repeatable. Presence-absence threshold was
   determined through the use of the receiver-operating characteristic
   (ROC). Presence within conservation network of strict consensus and
   locality records was similar which indicates an over-fitting of the
   former, the rest of the algorithms performed similarly, with exception

Abstract = {{Environmental pollution caused by Intensive Hog Feeding Operations
   (IHFO) has long been an issue of common concern worldwide. The research
   constructs a theoretical framework development for the technological
   implementation of IHFO with Biogas project Subsidy, Fermented Bed
   Subsidy and Sewage Charge in the Government Policy design. Linear
   Programming method is used to simulate the impacts of policy variables
   on the manure disposal of IHFO. The result finds that: only above the
   threshold, that the Biogas subsidy is increased by 200 Yuan per head or
   the Fermented Bed subsidy by 100 Yuan per head, can policy variables
   play effective impact on the decision of manure disposal technology, and
   the maximal social benefit is achieved. Under the current subsidy
   policy, response of producers differs in the scale of Hog Farms. Biogas
   project subsidy can play roles in large-scale Hog Farms, while the
   litter subsidy of Fermented Bed plays mainly in small and medium-scale
   Hog Farms. The existing subsidy intensity needs to be strengthened in
   order to achieve maximum social benefit. An improvement of levying
   method and intensity of sewage charge will be able to stimulate
   producers' emphasis on manure disposal, increasing the implementation

Abstract = {{Life cycle assessment (LCA) for new designs is a difficult and
   time-consuming task. This study creates a predictive eco-design process
   using depth-first search. The approach uses a multi-attribute function,
   a similarity threshold, and depth-first search (DFS) to match new
   designs to previous designs, search the similarity graph, separate
   designs into groups, and predicts environmental impacts for new designs
   from previous designs. The product attributes in this study are
   primarily product modules or product components that have major effects
   on the environmental impacts. Since there is always some uncertainty
   when estimating LCA results, the minimum and maximum LCA results from
   previous designs in each group are used to predict environmental impacts
   for new designs, as ranges. Case study results show that the method can
   be used to improve product design, early in the eco-design process.
   Consequently, the process can be used to reduce design time and reduce

Pages = {{173-216}},
Abstract = {{The hypothetico-deductive modelling framework introduced in Chap. 2 is
   applied to modelling the annual cycle of frost hardiness in boreal and
   temperate trees. The concept of frost hardiness is straightforward as
   such, denoting the threshold temperature that distinguishes between the
   damaging low-temperature range and the undamaging one. In practice,
   however, the concept of frost hardiness needs to be specified in regard
   to the tree tissue addressed and the methods used in assessing it.
   Similarly to the models of the annual cycle of photosynthetic capacity
   discussed in Chap. 4, the models of the annual cycle of frost hardiness
   can be tested continuously on a daily basis. The main environmental
   factors regulating the annual cycle of frost hardiness are air
   temperature and night length. These environmental factors regulate the
   annual cycle of frost hardiness directly and also indirectly by
   affecting the annual phenological cycle, which in turn changes the
   direct response. This complexity calls for development of integrated
   models that address both the fixed-sequence aspects of the phenological
   cycle and the fluctuating aspects of frost hardiness as such. Integrated
   models have been developed since the 1970s, and two of them are
   discussed in detail here. Both models are quite accurate, but there is
   still room for considerable improvement in their realism. Novel
   simulations using long-term air temperature records as input for an
   integrated model revealed large year-to-year variation in the annual
   cycle of frost hardiness.}},

Abstract = {{This article is the next voice in the discussion leading to
   international harmonization of methods of analyses and noise assessment
   in the wide range of frequencies, from 1 to 20 000 Hz. Introducing
   different methods and assessments of influence of low frequency noise on
   environment in many countries all over the world has caused difficulties
   in comparing the results and also made it impossible to establish common
   policy on this field. Because of fragmentary research in influence of
   infrasounds and low frequency noise on human, especially during long
   exposure, it is difficult to determine permissible levels. Determining
   those levels on the borders of hearing or perception threshold or often
   below them shows how little research is available, which consequently
   leads to cautious approach when it comes to establishing uniform legal
   regulations. Proper applying methods of measurements and the right
   assessment of noise influence on human body both in working and natural
   environment requires the correlation to the real way of noise acceptance
   by people, which means permissible noise levels safe for people's
   health. Exposure to low frequency noise was highlighted with the
   exclusion of workplace beyond the places defined as potential noise
   threat. This article presents own results of measurements which show
   that there are opportunities and needs for conducting noise analyses in
   the wide range of frequencies. It was suggested the direction of future
   work. It was pointed out that the assessment of infrasound and low sound
   noise influence and permissible levels should concern not only workplace
   but also relax and entertainment places, or means of transport. That is
   why a drive by a simple car was used here, to make own noise
   measurements and to present the analysis of results. Creating generally
   accessible database of results of noise measurements connected with
   non-occupational man activity was suggested.
   It seems reasonable that work on establishing legal regulations and
   international standards regarding the protection of natural and working
   environment against low frequency noise should be double-track. Firstly,
   the research to define the permissible levels and standards for the
   range of low frequency noise should be continued. Secondly, the so
   called audible noise - should be measured, analyzed and assessed using
   the A-weighting and also there should be gradually introduced methods,
   analyses, assessments and permissible levels of infrasound when
   G-weighting is applied.}},

Abstract = {{A recent metaanalysis identified certain management attributes that are
   associated with successful management of threshold-based systems.
   However, high variance among case studies indicates that these
   attributes do not guarantee good conservation outcomes, suggesting that
   additional factors may be at play. To better understand these additional
   factors, we compiled a list of effective governance attributes from the
   literature, and developed guidance for systematically evaluating their
   presence, absence, and the extent to which each attribute is actually
   manifested in a given case study. We also examine the distribution of
   rights and responsibilities within a system, and the resulting impacts
   on stewardship incentives. Here we present the results of this analysis
   as applied to Kane'ohe Bay, Hawai'i. Our results confirm that absent or
   incomplete effective governance attributes can negatively impact
   conservation outcomes. In Kane'ohe Bay, a public-private partnership
   temporarily compensated for gaps and weaknesses in the governance
   system, thereby creating conditions conducive to successfully reducing
   populations of invasive algae. However, this partnership has since

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Around the world, the decreasing health of coral reef ecosystems has
   highlighted the need to better understand the processes of reef
   degradation. The development of more sensitive tools, which complement
   traditional methods of monitoring coral reefs, may reveal earlier signs
   of degradation and provide an opportunity for pre-emptive responses. We
   identify new, sensitive metrics of ecosystem processes and benthic
   composition that allow us to quantify subtle, yet destabilizing, changes
   in the ecosystem state of an inshore coral reef on the Great Barrier
   Reef. Following severe climatic disturbances over the period 2011-2012,
   the herbivorous reef fish community of the reef did not change in terms
   of biomass or functional groups present. However, fish-based ecosystem
   processes showed marked changes, with grazing by herbivorous fishes
   declining by over 90\%. On the benthos, algal turf lengths in the
   epilithic algal matrix increased more than 50\% while benthic sediment
   loads increased 37-fold. The profound changes in processes, despite no
   visible change in ecosystem state, i.e., no shift to macroalgal
   dominance, suggest that although the reef has not undergone a visible
   regime-shift, the ecosystem is highly unstable, and may sit on an
   ecological knife-edge. Sensitive, process-based metrics of ecosystem
   state, such as grazing or browsing rates thus appear to be effective in
   detecting subtle signs of degradation and may be critical in identifying
   ecosystems at risk for the future.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{64-70}},
Abstract = {{Introduction and objective. The invasive alien species Ambrosia
   artemisiifolia cause environmental, agronomical and medical problems in
   many regions of the world, including Slovakia. The purpose of this study
   was to survey the spread and distribution of this species in Slovakia
   and to analyse its airborne pollen pattern.
   Materials and methods. To evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of
   Ambrosia invasion in the territory of Slovakia, herbarium specimens,
   published databases and field investigations were considered.
   Aerobiological sampling was based on the analysis of pollen records at
   five aerobiological stations in Slovakia. For Bratislava and Banska
   Bystrica Monitoring stations, trends in Ambrosia pollen seasons were
   determined using Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator.
   Results. Since the first record of A. artemisiifolia in Slovakia, the
   number of its colonies and its spread rate has increased considerably,
   and the colonisation of this species has been successful mainly in the
   south-western part of the country. Highest airborne pollen counts were
   recorded in Nitra, Trnava and Bratislava Monitoring Stations situated in
   the areas most infested by A. artemisiifolia in Slovakia. However, high
   pollen counts were also noted in Banska Bystrica and Kosice Monitoring
   Stations situated in areas where the source species was less abundant.
   During the study period, the number of days on which the pollen
   concentration exceeded the threshold of sensitivity increased
   significantly (+1.33 days/year) in Banska Bystrica, whereas the peak
   value decreased significantly (-13.37 pollen/year) in Bratislava.
   Conclusion. The number of the populations of A. artemisiifolia has
   increased considerably in recent years. Besides the most infested areas,
   high airborne pollen counts were also recorded in territories where the
   plant species was less abundant. During the study period, the intensity
   of Ambrosia pollen seasons decreased in Bratislava, probably due to
   changes in land-use practices, while the increasing trend in the pollen
   seasons intensity in Banska Bystrica mainly reflects the situation in
   the ragweed-infested remote areas due to long-range pollen transport.}},

   compounds (VOCs) present in such environment. We begin by approximating
   the sigmoid function that characterizes psychometric plots of
   probability of irritation detection (Q) versus VOC vapor concentration
   to a linear function. First, we apply an established equation that
   correlates and predicts human sensory irritation thresholds (SIT) (i.e.,
   nasal and eye irritation) based on the transfer of the VOC from the gas
   phase to biophases, e.g., nasal mucus and tear film. Second, we expand
   the equation to include other biological data (e.g., odor detection
   thresholds) and to include further VOCs that act mainly by
   ``specific{''} effects rather than by transfer (i.e., ``physical{''})
   effects as defined in the article. Then we show that, for 72 VOCs in
   common, Qvalues based on our calculated SITs are consistent with the
   Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) listed for those same VOCs on the basis of
   sensory irritation by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial
   Hygienists (ACGIH). Third, we set two equations to calculate the
   probability (Qmix) that a given air sample containing a number of VOCs
   could elicit chemosensory irritation: one equation based on response
   addition (Qmix scale: 0.00 to 1.00) and the other based on dose addition
   (1000{*}Qmix scale: 0 to 2000). We further validate the applicability of
   our air quality assessment method by showing that both Qmix scales
   provide values consistent with the expected sensory irritation burden
   from VOC mixtures present in a wide variety of indoor and outdoor
   environments as reported on field studies in the literature. These
   scales take into account both the concentration of VOCs at a particular
   site and the propensity of the VOCs to evoke sensory irritation. (C)

Abstract = {{Because consumer products release them, polybrominated diphenyl ethers
   (PBDEs) are frequently present in a variety of indoor environments
   including homes and workplaces. Our goal was to investigate PBDEs
   contamination of workplace air-conditioner filter dust to assess the
   health effects of contaminated dust on workers with occupational
   exposure. Nine medical clinics, four dental clinics, eight factory
   offices, and six factory clean rooms were selected in southern Taiwan
   between April 2013 and September 2014. Air-conditioner-filter dust was
   collected by a high-efficiency vacuum cleaner and then PBDEs were
   analyzed by a high-resolution gas chromatography coupled with
   high-resolution mass spectrometry. The S14PBDEs (the sum of BDE-28, 47,
   99, 100, 153, 154, 183, 196, 197, 203, 206, 207, 208, and 209) in
   independent-air-conditioner filter (IAF) dust was not significantly
   lower in dental clinics (736 ng g(-1)) than in medical clinics (1600 ng
   g(-1)) and electronic plant offices (2570 ng g(-1)). PBDEs level was
   distinctly higher by an order of magnitude in central-air-conditioner
   system filter (CASF) dust in clean rooms (32,600 ng g(-1)), than in IAF
   dust. In clinic and the office workers, PBDEs daily intake via indoor
   dust ingestion varied from 2.96 x 10(-8) to 1.25 x 10(-7) mg kg b.w.(-1)
   day(-1) (29.6-125 ng kg b.w.(-1) day(-1)), which was obviously below the
   lowest observed adverse effect of level (LOAEL) of 1 mg kg b.w.(-1)
   day(-1). Assessment of the risk of non-cancer diseases with
   neurobehavioral effects and of cancer with neurobehavioral effects in
   clinic and office workers was notably below threshold values
   (non-cancer: 1.00 and cancer: 1.00 x 10(-6)). In conclusion, clinic and
   office workers had no harmful effects in the currently existing levels
   of indoor dust PBDEs in workplaces. IAF or CSAF dust can possibly
   reflect spatial and temporal dust distribution in the microenvironment.
   It is also suggested that collection of air-conditioner filter dust may
   be an alternative method to conventional dust sampling for assessment of
   indoor contamination by PBDEs.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic marker-based identification of distinct individuals and
   recognition of duplicated individuals has important applications in many
   research areas in ecology, evolutionary biology, conservation biology
   and forensics. The widely applied genotype mismatch (MM) method,
   however, is inaccurate because it relies on a fixed and suboptimal
   threshold number (T-M) of mismatches, and often yields self-inconsistent
   pairwise inferences. In this study, I improved MM method by calculating
   an optimal T-M to accommodate the number, mistyping rates, missing data
   and allele frequencies of the markers. I also developed a pairwise
   likelihood relationship (LR) method and a likelihood clustering (LC)
   method for individual identification, using poor-quality data that may
   have high and variable rates of allelic dropouts and false alleles at
   genotyped loci. The 3 methods together with the relatedness (RL) method
   were then compared in accuracy by analysing an empirical frog data set
   and many simulated data sets generated under different parameter
   combinations. The analysis results showed that LC is generally one or
   two orders more accurate for individual identification than the other
   methods. Its accuracy is especially superior when the sampled multilocus
   genotypes have poor quality (i. e. teemed with genotyping errors and
   missing data) and highly replicated, a situation typical of noninvasive
   sampling used in estimating population size. Importantly, LC is the only
   method that guarantees to produce self-consistent results by
   partitioning the entire set of multilocus genotypes into distinct
   clusters, each cluster containing one or more genotypes that all
   represent the same individual. The LC and LR methods were implemented in
   a computer program COLONY for free download from the Internet.}},

Abstract = {{1. Movement data provide a window - often our only window - into the
   cognitive, social and biological processes that underlie the behavioural
   ecology of animals in the wild. Robust methods for identifying and
   interpreting distinct modes of movement behaviour are of great
   importance, but complicated by the fact that movement data are complex,
   multivariate and dependent. Many different approaches to exploratory
   analysis of movement have been developed to answer similar questions,
   and practitioners are often at a loss for how to choose an appropriate
   tool for a specific question.
   2. We apply and compare four methodological approaches: first passage
   time (FPT), Bayesian partitioning of Markov models (BPMM), behavioural
   change point analysis (BCPA) and a fitted multistate random walk (MRW)
   to three simulated tracks and two animal trajectories - a sea lamprey
   (Petromyzon marinus) tracked for 12 h and a wolf (Canis lupus) tracked
   for 1 year.
   3. The simulations - in which, respectively, velocity, tortuosity and
   spatial bias change highlight the sensitivity of all methods to model
   misspecification. Methods that do not account for autocorrelation in the
   movement variables lead to spurious change points, while methods that do
   not account for spatial bias completely miss changes in orientation.
   4. When applied to the animal data, the methods broadly agree on the
   structure of the movement behaviours. Important discrepancies, however,
   reflect differences in the assumptions and nature of the outputs.
   Important trade-offs are between the strength of the a priori
   assumptions (low in BCPA, high in MRW), complexity of output (high in
   the BCPA, low in the BPMM and MRW) and explanatory potential (highest in
   the MRW).
   5. The animal track analysis suggests some general principles for the
   exploratory analysis of movement data, including ways to exploit the
   strengths of the various methods. We argue for close and detailed
   exploratory analysis of movement before fitting complex movement models.}},

Abstract = {{The urban heat island (UHI) is a well-documented pattern of warming in
   cities relative to rural areas. Most UHI research utilizes remote
   sensing methods at large scales, or climate sensors in single cities
   surrounded by standardized land cover. Relatively few studies have
   explored continental-scale climatic patterns within common urban
   microenvironments such as residential landscapes that may affect human
   comfort.
   We tested the urban homogenization hypothesis which states that
   structure and function in cities exhibit ecological ``sameness{''}
   across diverse regions relative to the native ecosystems they replaced.
   We deployed portable micrometeorological sensors to compare air
   temperature and humidity in residential yards and native landscapes
   across six U.S. cities that span a range of climates (Phoenix, AZ; Los
   Angeles, CA; Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN; Boston, MA; Baltimore, MD; and
   Miami, FL).
   Microclimate in residential ecosystems was more similar among cities
   than among native ecosystems, particularly during the calm morning
   hours. Maximum regional actual evapotranspiration (AET) was related to
   the morning residential microclimate effect. Residential yards in cities
   with maximum AET < 50-65 cm/year (Phoenix and Los Angeles) were
   generally cooler and more humid than nearby native shrublands during
   summer mornings, while yards in cities above this threshold were
   generally warmer (Baltimore and Miami) and drier (Miami) than native
   forests. On average, temperature and absolute humidity were similar to 6
   \% less variable among residential ecosystems than among native
   ecosystems from diverse regions.
   These data suggest that common residential land cover and structural
   characteristics lead to microclimatic convergence across diverse regions
   at the continental scale.}},

Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{434-441}},

Abstract = {{Water scarcity is a widespread problem in many parts of the world. Most
   previous methods of water scarcity assessment only considered water
   quantity, and ignored water quality. In addition, the environmental flow
   requirement (EFR) was commonly not explicitly considered in the
   assessment. In this study, we developed an approach to assess water
   scarcity by considering both water quantity and quality, while at the
   same time explicitly considering EFR. We applied this
   quantity-quality-EFR (QQE) approach for the Huangqihai River Basin in
   Inner Mongolia, China. We found that to keep the river ecosystem health
   at a ``good{''} level (i.e., suitable for swimming, fishing, and
   aquaculture), 26\% of the total blue water resources should be allocated
   to meet the EFR. When such a ``good{''} level is maintained, the
   quantity- and quality-based water scarcity indicators were 1.3 and 14.2,
   respectively; both were above the threshold of 1.0. The QQE water
   scarcity indicator thus can be expressed as 1.3(26\%)vertical bar 14.2,
   indicating that the basin was suffering from scarcity problems related
   to both water quantity and water quality for a given rate of EFR. The
   current water consumption has resulted in degradation of the basin's
   river ecosystems, and the EFR cannot be met in 3 months of a year. To
   reverse this situation, future policies should aim to reduce water use
   and pollution discharge, meet the EFR for maintaining healthy river
   ecosystems, and substantially improve pollution treatment. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Pesticide application rates are high and increasing in upland
   agricultural systems in Thailand producing vegetables, fruits and
   ornamental crops, leading to the pollution of stream water with
   pesticide residues. The objective of this study was to determine the
   maximum per hectare application rates of two widely used pesticides that
   would achieve non-hazardous pesticide concentrations in the stream water
   and to evaluate how farm household incomes would be affected if farmers
   complied with these restricted application rates. For this purpose we
   perform an integrated modeling approach of a hydrological solute
   transport model (the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT) and an
   agent-based farm decision model (Mathematical Programming-based
   Multi-Agent Systems, MPMAS). SWAT was used to simulate the pesticide
   fate and behavior. The model was calibrated to a 77 km(2) watershed in
   northern Thailand. The results show that to stay under a pre-defined
   eco-toxicological threshold, the current average application of
   chlorothalonil (0.80 kg/ha) and cypermethrin (0.53 kg/ha) would have to
   be reduced by 80\% and 99\%, respectively. The income effect of such
   reductions was simulated using MPMAS. The results suggest that if farm
   households complied with the application thresholds then their income
   would reduce by 17.3\% in the case of chlorothalonil and by 38.3\% in
   the case of cypermethrin. Less drastic income effects can be expected if
   methods of integrated pest management were more widely available. The
   novelty of this study is to combine two models from distinctive
   disciplines to evaluate pesticide reduction scenarios based on
   real-world data from a single study site. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Odour pollution caused by municipal solid waste is a public concern.
   This study quantitatively evaluated the concentration, environmental
   impacts, and olfaction of volatile trace compounds released from a waste
   transfer station. Senventy-six compounds were detected, and ethanol
   presented the highest releasing rate and ratio of 14.76 kg/d and 12.30
   g/t of waste, respectively. Life cycle assessment showed that
   trichlorofluoromethane and dichlorodifluoromethane accounted for more
   than 99\% of impact potentials to global warming and approximately 70\%
   to human toxicity (non-carcinogenic). The major contributor for both
   photochemical ozone formation and ecotoxicity was ethanol. A detection
   threshold method was also used to evaluate odour pollution. Five
   compounds including methane thiol, hydrogen sulphide, ethanol, dimethyl
   disulphide, and dimethyl sulphide, with dilution multiples above one,
   were considered the critical compounds. Methane thiol showed the highest
   contribution to odour pollution of more than 90\%, as indicated by its
   low threshold. Comparison of the contributions of the compounds to
   different environmental aspects indicated that typical pollutants varied
   based on specific evaluation targets and therefore should be
   comprehensively considered. This study provides important information

Abstract = {{Effect-based monitoring is a recommended approach suggested in European
   Guidelines to assess the response of ecosystem affected by a pollution
   source, considering the effects at community, population, individual but
   also at suborganism level. A combined chemical, ecological and genetic
   approach was applied in order to assess the impact of a fluoropolymer
   plant on the macrobenthic community of the Northern Italian river
   Bormida (Piedmont region). The macrobenthic community living downstream
   of the industrial discharge was chronically exposed to a mixture of
   perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), with perfluorooctanoic add as the main
   compound, at concentrations up to several jig L-1. Ecological assessment
   proved that the downstream community was not substantially different
   from that living upstream of the pollution source. The impact on
   community is not quantifiable with the traditional monitoring methods
   used for ecological classification under European regulation because
   macrobenthic communities showed only slight differences in their
   structure. In order to highlight effects on genetic variability of the
   native population, a subcellular analysis by using the AFLP (Amplified
   Fragment Length Polymorphism) genetic technique was applied to genotype
   of individuals of a selected species (Hydropsyche modesta, Trichoptera)

Abstract = {{The modern manufacturing organizations are focused on making sustainable
   products by means of costs reduction and prevention of environmental
   problems. To achieve this, several tools are available to the
   organizations such as Quality Function Deployment for Environment (QFDE)
   which is the integration of voice of customer, voice of environment and
   quality characteristics. In this paper, an integrated QFDE, fuzzy
   Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Fuzzy
   Analytic Network Process (FANP) is proposed for sustainable product
   design to help companies identify the best design criteria for a
   specific product. Therefore, the DEMATEL method is used to assume the
   interdependence of customer attributes and, in addition, fuzzy Maximum
   Mean de-Entropy (MMDE) algorithm is utilized to choose the best and
   practical threshold value in DEMATEL process. Moreover, FANP will be
   integrated into QFDE as a prioritization technique and also fuzzy
   Logarithmic Least Squares Method (LLSM) is employed to find weights
   during the FANP process. An integrated QFDE methodology is appropriate
   to use in early design, since it does not require detailed information

   Conservation policies and programmes often prioritize geographies or
   specific management systems within specific geographies. I evaluate the
   variance in number of species at the site scale and estimate the
   contributions of fishing pressure, local habitat factors and regional
   geography to local diversity.
   Location Coral reefs of the south-western Indian Ocean (SWIO).
   Methods Site-level species richness data from an extensive field sample
   of common coral reef fish at 266 sites in seven SWIO countries were
   analysed to create four species richness metrics to evaluate the effects
   of local site, geography and management.
   Results The local number of species was strongly predicted by an
   asymptotic relationship with fish biomass, followed by habitat
   variables, and lastly by the geographical positions of latitude and
   longitude. A species richness centre or `hotspot' was found between
   Madagascar and the African coastline, but the variance attributable to
   geography when biomass and habitat effects were removed was small.
   Evaluation of the number of species in five existing fisheries
   management categories indicated that differences were chiefly influenced
   by biomass rather than habitat factors.
   Main conclusions Although the centre of species richness may indicate a
   climate refugium that should be considered in conservation
   prioritization, this diversity-centre effect can weaken if habitat and
   biomass features are reduced by climate disturbances and fishing.
   Consequently, the highest priority for conserving local numbers of reef
   fish species is to maintain biomass above the c. 600 kg ha(-1) threshold
   found in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Palm oil based biodiesel offers an alternative energy source that can
   reduce current dependence on conventional fossil fuels and may reduce
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions depending on the type of feedstock and
   processes used. In the Malaysian context, the palm oil industry not only
   provides high-yield, renewable feedstock to the world, it brings
   socio-economic development to the Malaysian rural community and
   contributes to the national income. However, the sustainability of palm
   oil remains controversial, due to deforestation, pollution and social
   conflicts associated with its production. Sustainability assessment is
   vital for the palm oil industry to identify weaknesses, improve its
   sustainability performance and improve consumer confidence. This paper
   proposes a holistic sustainability assessment framework for palm oil
   production with the aim to address the weaknesses of existing palm oil
   sustainability assessment methods. It identifies environmental, social
   and economic Headline Performance Indicators, Key Performance Indicators
   and their Performance Measures in crude palm oil production in a
   structured framework. Each quantitative/semi-quantitative performance
   measure is translated into Likert Scale of 1-5, where 3 is the threshold
   value, 5 is the ideal condition, and 1 is the worst case scenario.
   Calculation methods were established for the framework to provide
   quantitative assessment results. The framework was tested using a
   hypothetical example with data from existing studies. The results
   suggest that crude palm oil production in Malaysia is below the
   sustainability threshold. Evaluations of this sustainability assessment
   framework also demonstrate that it is a comprehensive assessment method
   for assessing sustainability of feedstock for biofuel production.}},

   an application to wind energy development}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying the impact of anthropogenic development on local populations
   is important for conservation biology and wildlife management. However,
   these local populations are often subject to demographic stochasticity
   because of their small population size. Traditional modeling efforts
   such as population projection matrices do not consider this source of
   variation whereas individual-based models, which include demographic
   stochasticity, are computationally intense and lack analytical
   tractability. One compromise between approaches is branching process
   models because they accommodate demographic stochasticity and are easily
   calculated. These models are known within some sub-fields of probability
   and mathematical ecology but are not often applied in conservation
   biology and applied ecology. We applied branching process models to
   quantitatively compare and prioritize species locally vulnerable to the
   development of wind energy facilities. Specifically, we examined species
   vulnerability using branching process models for four representative
   species: A cave bat (a long-lived, low fecundity species), a tree bat
   (short-lived, moderate fecundity species), a grassland songbird (a
   short-lived, high fecundity species), and an eagle (a long-lived, slow
   maturation species). Wind turbine-induced mortality has been observed
   for all of these species types, raising conservation concerns. We
   simulated different mortality rates from wind farms while calculating
   local extinction probabilities. The longer-lived species types (e.g.,
   cave bats and eagles) had much more pronounced transitions from low
   extinction risk to high extinction risk than short-lived species types
   (e.g., tree bats and grassland songbirds). High-offspring-producing
   species types had a much greater variability in baseline risk of
   extinction than the lower-offspring-producing species types. Long-lived
   species types may appear stable until a critical level of incidental
   mortality occurs. After this threshold, the risk of extirpation for a
   local population may rapidly increase with only minimal increases in
   wind mortality. Conservation biologists and wildlife managers may need
   to consider this mortality pattern when issuing take permits and
   developing monitoring protocols for wind facilities. We also describe
   how our branching process models may be generalized across a wider range
   of species for a larger assessment project and then describe how our
   methods may be applied to other stressors in addition to wind.}},

Abstract = {{The live plant nursery trade is a potential vector for pests and
   pathogens, which can spread to natural and developed environments with
   unintended ecosystem consequences. Simulated, approximately scale-free,
   tiered horticultural trade networks consisting of growers, wholesalers,
   and retailers were used to study the efficacy of quarantine inspection
   and isolation procedures for reducing the spread of infected materials
   to consumers. The quarantine algorithm temporarily isolated infected
   nurseries from the rest of the trade network, rewiring the affected
   trade connections to unquarantined nodes, until the infection was
   reduced below the detection threshold, at which time the formerly
   infected nursery was reincorporated into the trade network.
   Nodes were inspected for infection at regular intervals. Increasing the
   inspection interval resulted in higher levels of infection with large,
   system-wide oscillations whose period that matched the inspection
   interval. The timing of quarantine inspections of the largest hub in the
   grower tier drove the dynamics of the entire network. Increasing the
   proportion of growers or wholesalers increased infection level in most
   networks. Increasing the connectivity within the grower and wholesaler
   tiers led to large increases in mean infection levels. Focusing
   quarantine inspection efforts on hubs in the grower and wholesaler tiers
   may be the most efficient method for reducing the level of infected
   plant material sold by retailers in real plant trade networks. (C) 2015

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{831-845}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Coastal cliff erosion is a widespread problem that threatens property
   and infrastructure along many of the world's coastlines. Rates of
   erosion used for shoreline management are generally based on analysis of
   historic maps and aerial photographs which, in rocky coast environments,
   does not wholly capture the detail in the processes and the failures
   occurring across the cliff face. This study uses airborne LiDAR (Light
   Detection and Ranging) data to gain a quantitative understanding of
   cliff erosion along rocky coastline where recession rates are relatively
   low (c. 0.1 m yr(-1)).
   It was found that three-dimensional volumetric changes on the cliff face
   and linear rates of retreat can be reliably calculated from consecutive
   digital elevation models (DEMs) several years apart. Furthermore, the
   accuracy of the data on sloping surfaces was tested by applying a
   threshold below which data that could be construed as error were
   removed. Using a vertical change threshold of 0.5 m had limited effect
   on the computed rates of retreat. The spatial variability in recession
   rates around the coastline was considered in terms of the relationship
   with the varying boundary conditions (rock mass characteristics, cliff
   geometries, beach morphology) and forcing parameters (wave climate and
   wave exposure). Recession rates were statistically correlated with
   significant wave height (H (s) ), rock mass characteristics (GSI) and
   the ratio between the two (GSI/H (s) ).
   The current method of assessing rocky cliff recession using maps and
   aerial photographs tends to not only miss the detail in the
   three-dimensional nature of the cliff evolution, but may also be too
   coarse a resolution to capture the small scale changes that contribute
   to the overall failure. LiDAR data, although limited in its temporal
   extent due to it being a relatively new technology, is a suitable method
   of evaluating cliff erosion on a time scale of 3-4 years and provides
   additional insight into the process occurring in slowly eroding
   environments.}},

Title = {{Using the planetary boundaries framework for setting impact-reduction

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The planetary boundaries (PBs) framework suggests global limits for
   environmental interventions which could be used to set global goals for
   reducing environmental impacts. This paper proposes a procedure for
   using such global goals for setting impact-reduction targets at the
   scale of products for use, for example, in life cycle assessment (LCA)
   contexts, e.g. as a basis for evaluating the potential of interventions
   to reduce the environmental impact of products.
   The procedure consists of four steps: (i) identifying the PBs quantified
   in literature that correspond to an impact category which is studied in
   the product assessment context in question; (ii) interpreting what the
   identified PBs imply in terms of global impact-reduction targets; (iii)
   translating the outcome of (ii) to reduction targets for the particular
   global market segment to which the studied product belongs; and (iv)
   translating the outcome of (iii) to reduction targets for the studied
   product. The procedure requires some assumptions and value-based
   choices-the influence of these is tested by applying the procedure in a
   specific LCA context: a study of Swedish clothing consumption.
   The application of the procedure in an LCA context suggested the need
   for eliminating all or nearly all impact of Swedish clothing consumption
   for most impact categories. Thus, it is improbable that a single type of
   impact-reduction intervention (e.g. technological development or changed
   user behaviour) is sufficient. The outcome's strong dependence on impact
   category suggests that the procedure can help in prioritising among
   impact categories. Furthermore, the outcome exhibited a strong
   dependence on the chosen method for allocating the globally allowed
   impact between regions-this was tested by applying different principles
   identified in a literature review on the allocation of emissions rights.
   The outcome also strongly depended on the geographical scope-this was
   tested by changing the geographical scope from Sweden to Nigeria.
   The proposed procedure is feasible to use for LCA practitioners and
   other environmental analysts, and data is available to apply the
   procedure in contexts with different geographical scopes. Value-based
   choices are, however, unavoidable and significantly influence the
   outcome, which accentuates the subjectivity and potentially
   controversial nature of allocating a finite impact space to certain
   regions, market segments and products. How to match PBs with appropriate
   LCA impact categories is an important area for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Water is a major limiting factor of human survival and social economic
   development. Water security is also important for the ecological system.
   In this paper, the water security assessment index system of the Yellow
   River basin was developed based on three subsystems: the water resources
   subsystem, the water environment subsystem and the social economic
   subsystem. The integrated assessment of water security was developed
   based on the combination of set pair analysis (SPA) and fuzzy analytical
   hierarchy process (FAHP) as well as technique for order preference by
   similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), gray relational analysis (GRA),
   vague sets (VS) and matter element (ME) models. First, fuzzy cluster
   analysis method was used to check the consistency of all the models
   before and after implementing the integrated assessment. Secondly, the
   ranking values of four single assessment models (i.e., TOPSIS, GRA, VS
   and ME models) were analyzed by SPA method to get the consistency
   connection degree. Then FAHP was constructed to describe the relative
   importance of the four different single models when determining the
   weight coefficient in the integrated assessment model. And lastly, the
   integrated assessment model of water security was developed based on the
   ranking values and weight coefficients of the selected single assessment
   models. The conclusion of the developed integrated assessment model
   which was applied in the Yellow River basin showed that Sichuan province
   was at security level; Henan, Shandong, Qinghai and Shaanxi provinces
   were at the threshold security level; Shanxi, Gansu and Inner Mongolia
   provinces were at the relative insecurity level; Ningxia province was
   water no secure. The integrated assessment results showed that the
   improved integrated model presented in this paper had relatively better
   performance than single assessment models. The intention of this paper
   was to provide an integrated assessment model, propose potential
   countermeasures, and achieve sustainable water utilization in the Yellow
   River basin.}},

Abstract = {{Soil erosion by water is one of the main environmental problems in
   tropical mountain regions of Central America. Agroforestry systems have
   been shown to reduce erosion through their canopy cover and their
   contribution to the litter layer. This paper analyzes the influence of
   the cover and height of coffee strata and mixed shade trees, the ground
   cover (weeds and litter), the slope gradient and various soil features
   and characteristics relevant to erosion in six farms that apply the
   agroforestry system of coffee growing (Coffea arabica) with mixed shade
   trees of Musa spp and Inga spp. We determine the corresponding erosion
   thresholds, i.e. the value (erodibility factor) beyond which the
   reduction in erosion becomes statistically significant. A
   purpose-designed verification method was applied to determine whether
   the thresholds corresponded to the effective control of erosion. The
   study area is located in the hills around El Cua, in northern Nicaragua,
   an area with a humid tropical climate and a mean annual rainfall of 2770
   mm. An analytical method, based on the use of visual indicators, was
   used to analyze soil erosion by water. This approach enabled us to
   replicate the method in a sufficiently large number of cases for the
   results obtained to be considered reliable and representative of the
   study area. These results indicate that in the agroforestry system
   examined, for the cultivation of coffee and mixed shade trees (Musa spp
   and Inga spp), an average of 10.4\% of the area is affected by erosion.
   The erodibility factors identified were litter layer and slope gradient.
   The first of these factors accounted for 66\% of the variability of
   erosion, compared with 4\% in the second case. The erosion threshold
   value was between 60 and 65\% of the litter layer; beyond this level,
   the reduction in erosion was statistically significant. With this
   threshold, the soil was relatively little affected by erosion, around
   13\% of the cultivated area. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   characterization of pollution severity included both pollution level and

   multivariate nature of structural change in time series data. In this
   paper, I propose a simple approach aiming at coping with the
   multi-elemental compositional otolith transect in a multi-scale
   quantitative manner. More specifically, the proposed recursive
   partitioning method tries to bias the chronological clustering process
   by accommodating some form of user-specified constraints based on both
   intra- and inter-groups characteristics. This allows researchers to
   focus on biologically relevant information (i.e. the one researcher look
   for and can interpret). The finding of this study may be considered from
   the more general perspective of the utility of chronological clustering
   study of multivariate time series. Chronological clustering based on
   recursive partition is easily interpretable and directly applicable to
   detection of hidden discontinuities in any multivariate time series. In
   a multi-proxy context, it also provides a powerful exploratory tool for
   assessing the relative importance of cross-correlated variables in
   structuring the environmental histories, as well as the congruency
   between variables. Ultimately, this approach demonstrates the actual
   interest in using advanced processing techniques to fully exploit the
   rich potential of individual biological archives, such as fish otoliths,
   to characterize individual life history. This appears as a promising new
   tool for ecologists wishing to extract environmental histories from
   dendro- and sderochronological structures and would be a great help for
   practitioners working with chemical fingerprints. New functions for
   recursive partitioning using the R software environment are provided in
   a package and in the on-line Supplementary material together with a
   complete tutorial using full worked examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Phosphorus applied to soils in excess of crop requirement could create
   situations favorable to P enrichment in subsurface flow that contributes
   to eutrophication of surface water. This pathway of P loss can be more
   severe in muck (i.e., organic) soils where agricultural production is
   intensive. This study evaluated the suitability of various environmental
   and agronomic soil P tests initially designed for mineral soils to
   predict dissolved reactive P (DRP) in subsurface flow from organic
   soils. Intact soil columns were collected from 44 muck soils in Ontario
   to provide a wide range of soil test P levels. A lysimeter leaching
   study was conducted by evenly adding water in an amount equivalent to 5
   mm of rainfall. The leachate DRP concentration was linearly related to
   soil water-extractable P and CaCl2-extractable P with r2 values of 0.90
   and 0.93, respectively, and to Bray-1 P and FeO-impregnated filter paper
   extractable P in a split-line model with a change point. Mehlich-3 P and
   Olsen P, a method recommended for agronomic P calibration in Ontario,
   were not related to leachate DRP concentration. All P sorption index
   (PSI) based degree of P saturation (DPS) values were closely related to
   leachate DRP in split-line models, with the DPS indices expressed as
   Bray-1 P/PSI and FeO-P/PSI having the highest correlation with leachate
   DRP concentration. Because it is desirable from practical and economic
   standpoints that the environmental risk assessment shares the same soil
   test with agronomic P calibration, the two PSI-based DPS indices as
   presented can be considered as environmental risk indicators of DRP
   subsurface loss from organic soils.}},

Abstract = {{Many ecological systems are characterized by brief periods of increased
   resource availability called resource pulses. Empirical studies suggest
   that some populations of primary consumers grow rapidly in response to
   resource pulses, but others instead remain at low abundance despite
   increases in resource availability. Previous theory suggests that the
   lack of increase in primary consumers might be due to predators, which
   can respond to increased prey density both numerically, by increasing
   their own population, and functionally, by killing prey at a faster
   rate. The complexity of potential population responses to resource
   pulses can be assessed with simulations, but analytical conditions
   determining when one observes qualitatively distinct dynamics have yet
   to be identified. Here we use a graphical method based on a bifurcation
   diagram to derive the conditions leading to qualitatively distinct
   steady state and transient prey population dynamics as levels of
   predation (abundance and diversity) vary. When predation thresholds are
   crossed, consumer populations respond numerically to increases in their
   resources and provide a secondary resource pulse to their predators and
   parasites. These community dynamics have broad implications for the
   impact of changing predator communities on insect and rodent population
   outbreaks, which are economically and epidemiologically important.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{1. Highly calcareous (marl) lakes are infrequent but important
   freshwater ecosystems, protected under the EU Habitats and Species
   Directive. Chara lakes have been considered resistant to eutrophication
   owing to the self-stabilising properties of charophyte meadows. However,
   the opposite is suggested by the large-scale biodiversity declines in
   marl lake taxa in Europe, and evidence of charophyte sensitivity to
   eutrophication. We combined contemporary, palaeolimnological and
   archival methods to investigate the eutrophication of Hawes Water, a
   shallow marl lake in north-west England (U.K.).
   2. Changes in aquatic macrophyte and invertebrate communities were
   reconstructed through the analysis of historical macrophyte surveys and
   sedimentary plant and animal macrofossils in two dated sediment cores
   from the littoral and deep zones of the lake. In addition, chlorophyll
   and carotenoid pigments were analysed to track changes in primary
   production from benthic and pelagic areas. Substantial changes in
   macrophyte communities were detected over centennial timescales,
   suggesting high ecosystem sensitivity considering the presently moderate
   phosphorus concentrations in Hawes Water (mean annual total phosphorus
   20 gL(-1)).
   3. Two apparent periods of threshold-like change were identified from
   the sediment record: (i) changes in cyanobacteria
   (aphanizophyll+myxoxanthophyll to canthaxanthin+zeaxanthin) and
   potentially in nutrient stoichiometry, reductions in the maximum
   macrophyte colonisation depth and water clarity, reduced charophyte
   andPotamogetondiversity, and increases in Nymphaeaceae; and (ii) severe
   reductions in light availability inferred from subdecadal doubling in
   phytoplankton abundance, substantial increases in Daphnia abundance and
   the extinction of charophytes from higher water depths.
   4. Further, change in both the littoral and deeper water has confined
   key marl lake taxa to smaller niches. In the littoral, increasing
   siltation and reed and Nymphaeaceae densities caused extinction of
   Littorella uniflora in the early 1900s and have reduced the evenness of
   Characeae with suspected imminent extinction of two highly localised
   Chara spp. In the deeper water, upslope creep of maximum colonisation
   depth has reduced habitat for intermediate-depth marl lake taxa leading
   to the loss of four Potamogeton and one Chara species, and replacement
   of these taxa by Nuphar lutea.
   5. The large changes in macrophyte community composition and increased
   incidences of turbid water have reduced the distinctive and valued marl
   lake features of Hawes Water, indicating that marl lakes can, as a
   habitat type, be highly sensitive to eutrophication. The persistence of
   abundant generalist macrophyte species at considerable water depth may
   be a feature of high-alkalinity lakes in clearwater,
   macrophyte-dominated states, but is a distinct eutrophication response
   in marl lakes rather than an indication of resistance to eutrophication.}},

Abstract = {{A 1-year cycle of physico-chemical measurements was conducted in the
   Marano and Grado Lagoon (Adriatic Sea, Italy) with the aim to assess its
   trophic state. Some selected variables (nutrients, chlorophyll a,
   dissolved oxygen, temperature and salinity) were used to describe the
   system within the application of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and
   to compare it with other Mediterranean environments.
   From an ecological point of view the Marano and Grado Lagoon is one of
   the best conserved wetlands in the whole Mediterranean area and is
   protected by several European environmental pieces of legislation.
   However, the neighbouring mainland hosts several socio-economic
   activities which can affect its water quality. The results obtained in
   this work highlighted considerable spatial and temporal variability of
   physico-chemical parameters. Specifically, a large amount of
   anthropogenic nutrients, mainly in form of nitrogen (N), was carried
   from inland through river discharges in the Marano basin (western
   sector). However, these inputs were offset by the water exchange with
   the adjacent open sea, which exerted a dynamic dilution effect, and
   induced low water residence time thus limiting nutrients enrichment and
   their accumulation for long time periods. The Molar Redfield ratio
   (DIN/SRP) was always higher than the optimum value of 16 (in some cases
   it was up to 2000), thus suggesting that the system is phosphorus (P)
   limited, as confirmed by low chlorophyll a content, rare algal blooms
   and good water oxygenation. Trophic state indices and threshold values
   (EEA method, Carlson Trophic Index, TRIX and ASSETS) were applied. A
   broad range of classes was found (from oligotrophic to hypertrophic
   depending on water bodies, method applied and period of the year), thus
   suggesting that an over simplification of this complex ecosystem should
   be avoided. Further studies will be conducted in order to define the
   Lagoon's ecological status sensu WFD and the adequate management
   implications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{In the event of a natural disaster, such as a flood or earthquake, using
   fast and efficient methods for estimating the extent of the damage is
   critical. Automatic change mapping and estimating are important in order
   to monitor environmental changes, e.g., deforestation. Traditional
   change detection (CD) approaches are time consuming, user dependent, and
   strongly influenced by noise and/or complex spectral classes in a
   region. Change maps obtained by these methods usually suffer from
   isolated changed pixels and have low accuracy. To deal with this, an
   automatic CD framework-which is based on the integration of change
   vector analysis (CVA) technique, kernel-based C-means clustering (KCMC),
   and kernel-based minimum distance (KBMD) classifier-is proposed. In
   parallel with the proposed algorithm, a support vector machine (SVM) CD
   method is presented and analyzed. In the first step, a differential
   image is generated via two approaches in high dimensional Hilbert space.
   Next, by using CVA and automatically determining a threshold, the
   pseudo-training samples of the change and no-change classes are
   extracted. These training samples are used for determining the initial
   value of KCMC parameters and training the SVM-based CD method. Then
   optimizing a cost function with the nature of geometrical and spectral
   similarity in the kernel space is employed in order to estimate the KCMC
   parameters and to select the precise training samples. These training
   samples are used to train the KBMD classifier. Last, the class label of
   each unknown pixel is determined using the KBMD classifier and SVM-based
   CD method. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm
   for various remote sensing images and applications, two different
   datasets acquired by Quickbird and Landsat TM/ETM+ are used. The results
   show a good flexibility and effectiveness of this automatic CD method
   for environmental change monitoring. In addition, the comparative
   analysis of results from the proposed method (O. A.: 95.75, kappa: 0.91)
   and the classical CD techniques, namely, the principal component
   analysis-based CD method {[}overall accuracy (O. A.): 69.41, kappa:
   0.55], the independent component analysis-based CD method (O. A.: 85.48,
   kappa: 0.68), spectral angle mapper (O. A.: 75.38, kappa: 0.60), image
   subtraction CD (O. A.: 86.57, kappa: 0.69), and image rationing CD (O.
   A.: 76.45, kappa: 0.61) methods shows that the accuracy of the obtained
   change map can be considerably improved. Moreover, the results
   demonstrate that the proposed kernel-based CD methods do not depend on
   the instrument or the nature of change classes. (C) 2015 Society of

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of
   genetically modified organisms (GMO) into the environment, a monitoring
   of potential risks is prescribed after their deliberate release or
   placing on the market. Experience and data of already existing
   monitoring networks should be included. The present paper summarizes the
   major findings of a project funded by the Federal Agency for Nature
   Conservation (Nutzungsmoglichkeiten der Boden-Dauerbeobachtung der
   Lander fur das Monitoring der Umweltwirkungen gentechnisch veranderter
   Pflanzen. BfN Skripten, Bonn-Bad Godesberg 369, 2014). The full report
   in german language can be accessed on http://www.bfn.de and is available
   as Additional file 1. The aim of the project was to check if it is
   possible to use the German permanent soil monitoring program (PSM) for
   the monitoring of GMO. Soil organism communities are highly diverse and
   relevant with respect to the sustainability of soil functions. They are
   exposed to GMO material directly by feeding or indirectly through food
   chain interactions. Other impacts are possible due to their close
   association to soil particles.
   Results: The PSM program can be considered as representative with regard
   to different soil types and ecoregions in Germany, but not for all
   habitat types relevant for soil organisms. Nevertheless, it is suitable
   as a basic grid for monitoring the potential effects of GMO on soil
   invertebrates.
   Conclusions: PSM sites should be used to derive reference values, i.e.
   range of abundance and presence of different relevant species of soil
   organisms. Based on these references, it is possible to derive threshold
   values to define the limit of acceptable change or impact. Therefore, a
   minimum set of sites and minimum set of standardized methods are needed,
   i.e. characterization of each site, sampling of selected soil organism
   groups, adequate adaptation of methods for the purpose of monitoring of
   potential effects of GMO. Finally, and probably most demanding, it is
   needed to develop a harmonized evaluation concept.}},

Abstract = {{Under changing environments, not only univariate but also multivariate
   hydrological series might become nonstationary. Nonstationarity, in
   forms of change-point or trend, has been widely studied for univariate
   hydrological series, while it attracts attention only recently for
   multivariate hydrological series. For multivariate series, two types of
   change-point need to be distinguished, i.e., change-point in marginal
   distributions and change-point in the dependence structure among
   individual variables. In this paper, a three-step framework is proposed
   to separately detect two types of change-point in multivariate
   hydrological series, i.e., change-point detection for individual
   univariate series, estimation of marginal distributions, and
   change-point detection for dependence structure. The last step is
   implemented using both the Cramer-von Mises statistic (CvM) method and
   the copula-based likelihood- ratio test (CLR) method. For CLR, three
   kinds of copula model (symmetric, asymmetric, and pair-copula) are
   employed to construct the dependence structure of multivariate series.
   Monte Carlo experiments indicate that CLR is far more powerful than CvM
   in detecting the change-point of dependence structure. This framework is
   applied to the trivariate flood series composed of annual maxima daily
   discharge (AMDD), annual maxima 3 day flood volume, and annual maxima 15
   day flood volume of the Upper Hanjiang River, China. It is found that
   each individual univariate flood series has a significant change-point;
   and the trivariate series presents a significant change-point in
   dependence structure due to the abrupt change in the dependence
   structure between AMDD and annual maxima 3 day flood volume. All these
   changes are caused by the construction of the Ankang Reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{A jack of all trades can be master of nonethis intuitive idea underlies
   most theoretical models of host-use evolution in plant-feeding insects,

   use while being difficult to detect in extant populations, but host-use
   evolution may also be driven by adaptations for generalism. Here we used
   host-use data from insect collection records to parameterize a
   phylogenetic model of host-use evolution in armored scale insects, a
   large family of plant-feeding insects with a simple, pathogen-like life
   history. We found that a model incorporating positive correlations
   between evolutionary changes in host performance best fit the observed
   patterns of diaspidid presence and absence on nearly all focal host
   taxa, suggesting that adaptations to particular hosts also enhance
   performance on other hosts. In contrast to the widely invoked trade-off
   model, we advocate a toolbox model of host-use evolution in which
   armored scale insects accumulate a set of independent genetic tools,

Abstract = {{Biotic ligand models (BLMs) have advanced the ability to predict the
   concentrations of metals in surface waters likely to harm aquatic
   organisms. BLMs have been developed for several metals including Cu, Zn,
   Cd, and Ag. Additionally, the US Environmental Protection Agency has
   published guidance on the use of a BLM to develop water quality criteria
   for Cu. To validate the predictive performance of many BLMs, model
   predictions based on test water quality have been compared with
   corresponding laboratory toxicity measurements. Validation results are
   typically described in the published literature interms of the
   proportion of predicted effect concentrations that fall within a factor
   of 2 of measured values. In this article, an alternative is presented
   using a receiver operating characteristics approach and regression
   prediction limit analyses, quantifying the probabilities of true and
   false predictions of excess toxicity risk based on toxic unit
   calculations and a risk management threshold of 1. The approaches are
   applied to a published Zn BLM and 3 simulated data sets that reflect
   attributes of other published BLM validation data. The overall accuracy
   of the unified Zn BLM is estimated to be 80\% to 90\%, and analyses of
   simulated data suggest a similar level of accuracy for other published
   BLMs. Further application of these validation methods to other BLMs may

Abstract = {{The accumulation of the heavy metals in the soil received a particular

   96.12 \% (Cu) and 84.38 \% (Pb), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to Lead (Pb) from soil and dust in urban areas continues to
   threaten human health especially that of children, who are more likely
   to ingest a higher Pb fraction from contaminated soil. Geostatistical
   approaches were evaluated for the prediction of soil Pb concentrations.
   Ordinary kriging (OK) and co-kriging (CoK) were used to predict spatial
   distributions of both soil Pb concentrations and bioaccessibility. The
   relative accuracies of the developed predictive models were assessed
   using of coefficients of determination (R-2) and the root mean square
   error (RMSE) based on the cross validation method. The accuracy of the
   final model was evaluated via comparison between predicted and
   traditional soil measurements. While OK models (n = 73) were unreliable
   for predicting a Pb concentration surface, correlation between Pb and Zn
   was a useful mechanism for obtaining better predictions of soil Pb using
   CoK. The CoK model of log transformed Pb with Zn resulted in the best
   fitted model (R-2 = 0.63). The percentage relative improvement (RI) for
   this model was 39\% which suggested relatively reliable prediction
   accuracy. A probability kriging (PK) surface was used to describe the
   probability of bioaccessibility exceeding a threshold of 17\% as an
   indicator for potential human risk. The areas with highest probability
   of exceeding the threshold were in agreement with previous risk area
   divisions related to blood Pb (BPb) levels for children under 5 years of
   age. The results of this research confirmed that geostatistical methods
   had the ability to rapidly estimate soil Pb distributions for
   environmental health risk assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{236-248}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The Lippe is a lowland river located in the Western part of Germany and
   has been heavily impacted by coal mining activities ever since. Although
   mining activities significantly decreased during the last decades, the
   associated discharge of salt-enriched mine water into the river still
   poses a persistent threat to the local benthic invertebrate and diatom
   communities. To analyze the effect of salt pollution on invertebrate and
   diatom species, biological and chemical data were compiled for this
   study from a publicly available database. Changes in the community
   composition due to increased salt concentrations were explored by
   Non-Metrical-Multidimensional Scaling. Indicator species and salinity
   thresholds for single species and communities were identified using the
   method TITAN (Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis). The method is an
   analytical approach to detect changes in frequency and abundance of
   species along an environmental gradient by combining the methods of
   change point analysis (nCPA) and indicator species analysis, The
   obtained salinity preferences and individual and community thresholds
   were compared to the literature and existing salinity classifications.
   For both diatoms and benthic invertebrates.
   Non-Metrical-Multidimensional Scaling showed a clear split between
   samples of high and low salinities. Significant salinity thresholds were
   determined for 50 invertebrate and 58 diatom species of which 23
   respectively 18 species were described as `reliable' indicators
   according to the specifications given by Baker and King (2010). A
   majority of salt-tolerant indicator organisms were invasive species. For
   both organism groups, major changes in community composition were
   detected at a conductivity value exceeding 900 mu S/cm. A reduction of
   the average salinity to below this threshold may have positive effects
   on the overall species richness and the persistence of sensitive taxa in
   the river Lippe. Individual and community thresholds may however be
   data-dependent to a certain degree and subjected to fluctuations
   considering the potential interdependencies between salinity and
   additional physico-chemical and environmental parameters (e.g. water
   temperature, lime content). (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Species distribution models (SDMs) are an important tool in biogeography
   and phylogeography studies, that most often require explicit absence
   information to adequately model the environmental space on which species
   can potentially inhabit. In the so-called background pseudo-absences
   approach, absence locations are simulated in order to obtain a complete
   sample of the environment. Whilst the commonest approach is random
   sampling of the entire study region, in its multiple variants, its
   performance may not be optimal, and the method of generation of
   pseudo-absences is known to have a significant influence on the results
   obtained. Here, we compare a suite of classic (random sampling) and
   novel methods for pseudo-absence data generation and propose a
   generalizable three-step method combining environmental profiling with a
   new technique for background extent restriction. To this aim, we
   consider 11 phylogenetic groups of Oak (Quercus sp.) described in
   Europe. We evaluate the influence of different pseudo-absence types on
   model performance (area under the ROC curve), calibration (reliability
   diagrams) and the resulting suitability maps, using a cross-validation
   approach. Regardless of the modelling algorithm used, random-sampling
   models were outperformed by the methods that incorporate environmental
   profiling of the background, stressing the importance of the
   pseudo-absence generation techniques for the development of accurate and
   reliable SDMs. We also provide an integrated modelling framework
   implementing the methods tested in a software package for the open

Abstract = {{Particle mass concentrations (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1) and particle number

   Statistical methods were applied on a three-month hourly data set (9th
   January to 24th March 2014) to study the influence of north-easterly
   winds on the patterns of particle mass and PNC size distributions. The
   24-h concentrations of particle mass obtained in this study were below
   the standard values detailed by the Recommended Malaysian Air Quality
   Guideline (RMAQG), United States Environmental Protection Agency (US
   EPA) and European Union (EU) except for PM2.5, which recorded a 24-h
   average of 30 +/- 18 gg m(-3) and exceeded the World Health Organisation
   (WHO) threshold value (25 mu g m(-3)). Principal component analysis
   (PCA) revealed that PNC with smaller diameter sizes (0.27-4.50 mu m)
   showed a stronger influence, accounting for 57.6\% of the variability in

   steadily in the morning with a distinct peak observed at around 8.00 h,
   related to a combination of dispersion of accumulated particles
   overnight and local traffic. In addition to local anthropogenic,
   agricultural burning and forest fire activities, long-range transport
   also affects the study area. Hotspot and backward wind trajectory
   observations illustrated that the biomass burning episode (around

Abstract = {{Downwelling solar, Q(si), and longwave, Q(li), irradiances at the
   earth's surface are the primary energy inputs for many hydrologic
   processes, and uncertainties in measurements of these two terms confound
   evaluations of estimated irradiances and negatively impact hydrologic
   modeling. Observations of Q(si) and Q(li) in cold environments are
   subject to conditions that create additional uncertainties not
   encountered in other climates, specifically the accumulation of snow on
   uplooking radiometers. To address this issue, we present an automated
   method for estimating these periods of snow accumulation. Our method is
   based on forest interception of snow and uses common meteorological
   observations. In this algorithm, snow accumulation must exceed a
   threshold to obscure the sensor and is only removed through scouring by
   wind or melting. The algorithm is evaluated at two sites representing
   different mountain climates: (1) Snoqualmie Pass, Washington (maritime)
   and (2) the Senator Beck Basin Study Area, Colorado (continental). The
   algorithm agrees well with time-lapse camera observations at the
   Washington site and with multiple measurements at the Colorado site,
   with 70-80\% of observed snow accumulation events correctly identified.
   We suggest using the method for quality controlling irradiance
   observations in snow-dominated climates where regular, daily maintenance

Abstract = {{All countries of the European Union are required to determine the
   evolution of groundwater quality, including trend assessment. With this
   aim, the Water Framework Directive advises using standardized
   statistical analysis, like least squares regression. But this
   methodology is not applicable to all situations and what's more, does
   not offer a sound methodological framework. There are many statistical
   procedures to evaluate temporal behaviour of environmental data but,
   when applied unconnectedly, erroneous conclusions can be reached due to
   bias of assuming partial or particular conducts. In this paper, a
   methodology for studying such information is proposed, integrating most
   common methods for time series analysis. To provide a sound scientific
   basis to the methodology, statistic intervals combined with trend
   assessment are proposed, after adjusting a regression curve and applying
   smoothing techniques to select the baseline level. Confidence intervals
   have been used when a threshold value does exist. Whether it is not
   fixed or the baseline level exceeds the standard, prediction intervals
   were employed. The approach has been analysed at Plana de Vinaroz
   Groundwater Body (PV). As a result, PV is classed of poor chemical
   status in regard to diffuse pollution and sea water intrusion, and
   consequently a programme of measures is necessary. In relation with
   marine intrusion, a regional downward trend has been found, showing no
   further deterioration. An additional outcome of the procedure is a
   methodological framework for the systematic review of the relevant
   information for evaluation of Groundwater Body chemical status, which
   includes additional steps to check the effectiveness of the programme of
   measures and update the baseline level periodically. The proposed
   methodology, based on procedures usually applied separately, provides a
   comprehensive framework for groundwater quality data analysis. It will
   allow more rigorous implementation objectives of the Directive. Results
   obtained for the developed case are more robust from the statistical
   point of view, because all hypotheses have been contemplated.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment contamination by heavy metals can result in significant damage
   to the ecological water environment. Sediment dredging is a useful way
   to reduce the adverse effects of heavy metal pollution in freshwater.
   The dredging depth is a key parameter in environmental dredging
   engineering. In this paper, we propose an innovative method called the
   critical-risk-depth method for calculating the environmental dredging
   depth that has been specifically designed for removal of river sediments
   contaminated by heavy metals. To determine the critical risk depth for
   dredging, the heavy metal concentrations at different sediment depths
   and their potential ecological risks must be tested and evaluated. The
   first step of the method involves analyzing sediments to determine the
   lateral and vertical distribution of heavy metals. In the next step,
   Hakanson's potential ecological risk index is used to assess the
   ecological risk of heavy metals at different sediment depths. Finally,
   the recommended environmental dredging depths are calculated based on
   the potential risk for change in the vertical distribution and the given
   threshold level for the potential critical risk from heavy metals. We
   carried out a case study to determine the dredging depth for river
   sediment in Pinghu. The sediment analysis results show that the contents
   of Cd, Zn, and Pb are excessive when compared with the local soil
   background levels. Because of the accumulation effect of heavy metals in
   sediments, the heavy metal contents tend to decrease with sediment
   depth, but this trend may change as a result of human activities and
   other river dredging events. There is a high potential ecological risk
   level from heavy metal pollution in sediments in the study area, and the
   recommended environmental dredging depths of the ten rivers range from
   35 to 100 cm.}},

Abstract = {{DNA quantity can be a hindrance in ecological and evolutionary research
   programmes due to a range of factors including endangered status of

   conditions on preservation methods. A potential solution to low-quantity
   DNA lies in whole genome amplification (WGA) techniques that can
   substantially increase DNA yield. To date, few studies have rigorously
   examined sequence bias that might result from WGA and next-generation
   sequencing of nonmodel taxa. To address this knowledge deficit, we use
   multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and double-digest RAD
   sequencing on the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) to quantify bias
   in genome coverage and SNP calls when compared to raw genomic DNA
   (gDNA). We focus our efforts in providing baseline estimates of
   potential bias by following manufacturer's recommendations for starting
   DNA quantities (>100ng). Our results are strongly suggestive that MDA
   enrichment does not introduce systematic bias to genome
   characterization. SNP calling between samples when genotyping both
   de-novo and with a reference genome are highly congruent (>98\%) when
   specifying a minimum threshold of 20X stack depth to call genotypes.
   Relative genome coverage is also similar between MDA and gDNA, and
   allelic dropout is not observed. SNP concordance varies based on
   coverage threshold, with 95\% concordance reached at similar to 12X
   coverage genotyping de-novo and similar to 7X coverage genotyping with

   solution for next-generation molecular ecological studies when DNA

Abstract = {{In seasonally snow-covered environments, snow significantly impacts upon
   vegetative phenology. As such, there is a need to derive land surface
   phenological descriptors that are free of the influence of snow-cover.
   The presence of on-ground snow-cover influences the phenological
   descriptors produced using some remotely sensed vegetation indices. This
   study proposes a method that uses both the Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Infrared Index
   (NDII) to obtain dates for the start and end of the growing season. The
   method operates in the phase-spaces (sometimes referred to as feature-
   or band-spaces) created by the intersection of the NDVI-NDII data-space
   of individual pixels and can be used to derive descriptors for the start
   and end of the growing period as well as period corresponding with the
   end of green-up. This paper describes the origins and rationale for the
   method, which was applied to a MODIS image time-series of Australia's
   alpine bioregion for 2000-mid-2001. The results were validated against
   descriptors derived using the method of Delbart et al. (2005). For the
   start of the growing period, the validation indicated there was moderate
   correlation (r = 0.51, p <= 0.001) between the descriptors. Noise in the
   NDII time-series used resulted in little, or no, correlation for the end
   of the growing period (r = -0.13, p <= 0.001), and the correlation for
   the end of the green-up period was somewhat limited (r = 0.24, p <=
   0.001). In contrast to traditional NDVI threshold methods, the
   phase-space algorithm proposed here provided for a clear set of
   definitions that correspond with biophysical phenomena of the land
   surface, such as the offset and on-set of seasonal snow-cover. (C) 2015

   enhancement and Hough transform (HT) is proposed. First, short-time
   Fourier transform (STFT) is carried out on the space-borne radar LFM
   pulse signal with the Gaussian window to acquire the time-frequency
   spectrum; the spectrum is then converted into the time-frequency image.
   Second, in order to observe the weak signal's details from the image,
   contrast stretching is implemented on the time-frequency image and the
   trailing induced by the spurious clutter is eliminated to strengthen the
   chirp line of the LFM signal. Third, the line is detected through HT on
   the enhanced time-frequency image, and the coordinates and gray values
   of the pixels passed through by the line are extracted in the
   time-frequency image; then these gray values are filtered by the median
   filter before being binarized with the gray threshold; the
   anti-pulse-splitting mechanism is adopted to determine the start and the
   end of the chirp line segment. Measured data experiments show that the
   method can effectively detect the space-borne radar LFM pulse signal
   under a low SNR environment, determine the pulse's arrival time and end
   time, estimate its parameters, and is superior to direct STFT-Radon
   transform and direct STFT-HT. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Characterising hydroperiod and vegetation for flood-pulsed wetlands is a
   critical first step towards understanding their ecology. In large,
   data-poor wetlands such as Botswana's Okavango Delta, quantifying
   hydrology and ecology presents great logistic and financial challenges,
   yet relationships between hydrology and floodplain ecology are essential
   inputs to management. This paper describes an approach to improving
   ecological understanding by seeking relationships between archival
   remote sensing data and floodplain vegetation data. We produced a high
   spatial resolution (30 x 30 m) time series of annual flood frequency
   from Landsat 5TM imagery for the period 1989-2009. A second, lower
   spatial resolution (250 x 250 m) series of monthly flood extent was
   developed from a band 1 (0.62-0.67 mu m) threshold of MODIS (MOD09Q1)
   imagery for the period 2000-2012. Vegetation composition and abundance
   was sampled in 30 floodplain sites, using a modified Braun-Blanquet
   approach. Interpreted flood extent from MODIS was 92 \% accurate
   compared to the Landsat interpretation, and 89 \% accurate when assessed
   against field data. Three major classes of floodplain vegetation were
   identified from ordination and cluster analysis: Occasionally flooded
   savanna, Seasonally flooded grassland, and Seasonally flooded sedgeland.
   Relationships identified between hydroperiod and vegetation communities
   were tested against five validation sites, in four of which indicator
   species occurrence was predicted with a parts per thousand yen60 \%
   accuracy. The methods used are simple, objective, repeatable and
   inexpensive. Relating floodplain vegetation to hydrological history
   provides a means of predicting shifts in species composition and
   abundance for given changes in hydrology.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing exploitation effort and efficiency have been leading to
   population declines and extinctions among large marine animals.
   Understanding the magnitude of such losses is challenging because
   current baselines about species' abundances and distributions in the sea
   were mostly established after humans had started affecting marine
   populations. For artisanal fisheries, from which written historical
   records are rarely, if ever, available, approaches based on gathering
   anecdotal information from fishers' knowledge are a promising method to
   know the past environmental conditions. We interviewed coastal artisanal
   fishers, with ages varying from 15 to 85 years, to detect temporal
   changes in the catch abundance of large fish species, particularly the
   largetooth sawfish Pristis pristis and the goliath grouper Epinephelus
   itajara within Abrolhos Bank, Brazil. Most fishers considered that
   fishing has led to species depletion. However, older fishers reported
   significantly more species and larger species as depleted than young
   fishers. Older fishers caught significantly larger largetooth sawfish
   and goliath grouper in the past than younger fishers. The largetooth
   sawfish has not been caught or sought for more than 10 years.
   Probabilistic tests provided no definitive evidence for local
   extinction, although the past record of sightings indicates a population
   decline close to the threshold level for extinction probability. We
   provide evidence that small-scale artisanal fisheries can decimate the
   abundance of large coastal fishes, one of those almost close to local
   extinction. Finally, our results suggest that the younger generation is
   not aware of past ecological conditions, indicating the occurrence of a
   shifting baseline syndrome among the fishing community.}},

Abstract = {{Subsoil and shallow groundwater surrounding the Luhuagang landfill site
   (LLS) have been contaminated by leachate that contains organic chemicals
   in Kaifeng, China. The composition and spatial distribution of organic
   pollutants in shallow groundwater near the LLS was investigated by
   analyzing 28 shallow groundwater samples that were collected in May
   2010. The ambient severity method was used to evaluate the potential
   risks to human health and the environment from organic contaminants in
   the shallow groundwater. Volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds in
   the groundwater samples were screened using full-scan gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry, and seven organic compounds were
   detected. 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-DB), 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene
   (1,2,3-TCB), and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4-TCB) were detected in all
   groundwater samples, while naphthalene was detected in 13 samples
   (detection rate 46.4 \%). The highest 1,2-DB concentration was 277.45 mu
   g/L, and all 1,2-DB concentrations were below the Chinese drinking water
   quality threshold of 1000 mu g/L. Concentrations of 1,2,4-TCB, 1,2,3-TCB
   and naphthalene exceeded the Chinese drinking water quality limit in 6
   samples, 3 samples, and 1 sample, respectively. 1,2-DB, 1,2,3-TCB, and
   1,2,4-TCB have already formed a small contamination plume close to the
   landfill; however, their concentrations decrease in a
   northwest/southeast direction. Shallow groundwater around the LLS is
   severely contaminated by 1,2,4-TCB and 1,2,3-TCB, mainly as a result of
   either leachate from the landfill or refuse from the village. There are
   greater potential risks to human health and the environment from
   1,2,4-TCB than from 1,2-DB and 1,2,3-TCB. These results will help
   support management of groundwater resources in this area.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports on the surface distribution of toxic elements (TEs;
   As, Be, and Cd) and persistent organic pollutants {[}POPs; e.g.,
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)] in agricultural soils affected
   by mining and heavy industry from the industrial regions of North
   Bohemia and North Moravia. In this study, these regions are considered
   as test regions to study the impacts of heavy industry emissions on
   agricultural soils.
   From 2000 to 2010, agricultural soils were sampled and their
   physicochemical properties and contamination levels of TEs (As, Be, and
   Cd) and POPs (PAHs) determined. The pseudototal content (from Aqua regia
   extracts) and plant available fraction (from 1 M NH4NO3 extracts) of
   TEs, as well as the total PAH content in humic horizons of arable soils
   and grasslands, were analyzed. The surface spatial variability of these
   contaminants was evaluated using the kriging method. Threshold values
   for the probability estimation were adapted from the limit values
   provided by newly proposed Czech legislation.
   We show that the soil environments of the study area are polluted by
   anthropogenic material directly connected to historical mining and
   industrial activities, including lignite mining in North Bohemia and
   hard coal mining and heavy industry in North Moravia. The increased As
   contents in the soils contribute to the most important environmental
   problems in North Bohemia, where anthropogenic and geogenic sources of
   As interact. In North Moravia, anthropogenic pollution linked to coal
   combustion and metallurgy has increased Cd and PAH contents in
   agricultural soils. However, concentrations of these pollutants do not
   exceed limits for food safety in soils from these regions.
   This study shows that agriculture can coexist in regions impacted by
   heavy industry emissions, like the study regions documented here. Such
   activity requires that a suitable methodology is implemented to evaluate
   soil contamination and a risk assessment is carried out. In addition,
   suitable precautions should be undertaken in areas close to industry,
   such as grassing over contaminated arable lands to reduce wind erosion.}},

Abstract = {{Hedgerows are an important semi-natural habitat for invertebrates and
   other wildlife within agricultural landscapes. Hedgerow quality can be
   greatly affected either by over-or under-management. Neglect of
   hedgerows is an increasingly important issue as traditional management
   techniques such as hedgelaying become economically unviable. In the UK,
   funding for hedge management is available under agri-environment schemes
   but relatively little is known about how this impacts on wider
   biodiversity. We used a randomised block experiment to investigate how
   habitat structural change, arising from a range of techniques to
   rejuvenate hedgerows (including more economic/mechanised alternatives to
   traditional hedgelaying), affected invertebrate abundance and diversity.
   We combined digital image analysis with estimates of foliage biomass and
   quality to show which aspects of hedge structure were most affected by
   the rejuvenation treatments. All investigated aspects of habitat
   structure varied considerably with management type, though the abundance
   of herbivores and predators was affected primarily by foliage density.
   Detritivore abundance was most strongly correlated with variation in
   hedge gap size. The results suggest that habitat structure is an
   important organising force in invertebrate community interactions and
   that management technique may affect trophic groups differently.
   Specifically we find that alternative methods of hedgerow rejuvenation
   could support abundances of invertebrates comparable or even higher than
   traditional hedgelaying, with positive implications for the restoration
   of a larger area of hedgerow habitat on a limited budget.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy metal contamination of clay waste through the phosphate
   beneficiation process is a serious problem faced by scientists and
   regulators worldwide. Through the beneficiation process, heavy metals
   naturally present in the phosphate rocks became concentrated in the clay
   waste. This study evaluated the concentration of heavy metals and their
   fractions in the clay waste in order to assess the risk of environmental
   contamination. A fivestep sequential extraction method, the risk
   assessment code (RAC), effects range low (ERL), effects range medium
   (ERM), the lowest effect level (LEL), the severe effect level (SEL), the
   redistribution index (Utf), the reduced partition index (I), residual
   partition index (I-R), and the Nemerow multi-factor index (PC) were used
   to assess for clay waste contamination. Heavy metals were analyzed using
   high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS)
   and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).
   Correlation analyses were carried out to better understand the
   relationships between the chemical characteristics and the contents of
   the different phase fractions. Concentrations of Cd and Cu confirmed
   that both were bound to the exchangeable fraction (F1) and the carbonate
   fraction (F2), presenting higher mobility, whereas Pb wasmost abundant
   in the FeMn oxide fraction (F3) and organic matter fraction (F4). The
   residual fraction (F5) contained the highest concentrations (> 60 \%) of
   As, Cr, Mo, V, and Zn, with lower mobility. Application of the RAC index
   showed that Cd and Cu should be considered a moderate risk, whereas As,
   Cr, Mo, Pb, and Zn presented a low risk. Cadmium and Cu contents in
   mobile fractions F1 and F2 were higher than ERL but lower than ERM. On
   the other hand, As, Pb, and Zn contents of mobile fractions F1 and
   F2were lower than ERL and ERM guideline values. Moreover, total Pb
   concentrations in the clay waste were below the lowest effect level
   (LEL) threshold value period, Cr and Zn values in the clay waste were
   determined to have exceeded the severe effect level (SEL) limit values,
   whereas Cd and Cu level ranges between LEL and SEL indicate moderate
   contamination. I-R values of heavy metals in the clay waste confirmed
   that Cd and Cu were bound to the exchangeable and carbonate fractions
   and presented higher mobility, whereas As, Cr, Mo, Pb, V, and Zn were
   bound to organic or residual fractions and consequently exhibit lower
   mobility. A Nemerow multi-factor index revealed that the mine site
   contains high levels of Cd, Cu, V, and Zn pollution. As and Cr were
   found at a moderate level of contamination, whereas Pb was present at a
   safe level of contamination. The order of the comprehensive
   contamination indices was Cd > Cu> Mo > Zn > V > Cr > As > Pb,
   indicating that the assessment of clay waste, especially with Cd and Cu,
   should be undertaken to control heavy metal contamination in adjacent
   urban and mine areas at the Eshidiya mines.}},

Abstract = {{Global warming, due to the enhanced greenhouse effect, is likely to have
   significant effect on the hydrological cycle, which would result in more
   evaporation, more precipitation, and uneven distribution of
   precipitation around the globe. Some parts of the world may see
   significant reduction in precipitation, or major alterations in the
   timing of wet and dry seasons, and increases in both floods and
   droughts. In China, a warming trend has been observed across the
   mainland region during the past 50 years, with an increasing temperature
   of about 0.2-0.3 A degrees C/10 year in northern and less than 0.1 A
   degrees C/10 year in southern China. To understand the characteristics
   of climate change, this study has conducted statistical analysis on
   climate parameters from 12 representative meteorological stations in
   southwest China karst region. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall rank
   statistic method and the Pettitt-Mann-Whitney change point statistics
   were used, respectively, for the change trend and change point analyses
   of daily temperature and precipitation at each station. The 5-year
   moving averages of 11 climate parameters showed a clear increase in the
   maximum and minimum annual average temperature in southwest China,
   however, no consistent increase for precipitation. In addition to
   temperature and precipitation, changes in the atmospheric pressure, wind
   speed, and cloud cover were also observed from this study. Changes in
   climate characteristics will or have altered the hydrologic cycle in the
   region, which would induce more frequent drought and flood,
   redistribution of water resources, rocky desertification, and carbon
   balance, and will ultimately have great impacts on the social, economic,
   and environmental life in the region.}},

Abstract = {{The wind erosion is the main cause of many environmental phenomena such
   as desertification, dust haze, sandstorms, and energy balance changes in
   the atmosphere. Wind erosion occurs when the friction velocity exceeds
   the threshold friction velocity. Threshold friction velocity depends on
   many parameters such as surface roughness, heat flux, moisture of soil
   and soil texture. In this article, the horizontal and vertical fluxes of
   particles due to wind erosion have been studied using a numerical
   method. Atmospheric boundary layer has been modeled with computational
   fluid dynamic for different wind profiles and the flow field near the
   surface has been solved. The values of velocity's components of air flow
   have been used to calculate wind erosion fluxes according to balance
   equations of particles. The erosion flux of particles in terms of
   suspension, saltation and creeping have been calculated according to
   threshold friction velocities. Finally, the relation between fluxes has
   been determined and the correlation of erosion flux and direct
   suspension in terms of friction velocity and particle diameter has been
   presented. Comparing the results with previous works revealed that the
   value of direct suspension of particle C (kg/ms) is related to total

Abstract = {{The effect of phosphate waste rocks dumped in the Three Gorges Reservoir
   Region on water quality has been disregarded. For this reason, the
   leaching behaviours of six phosphate waste rock piles deposited in
   Xiangxi River watershed were characterised in this study in accordance
   with Method 1313 and Method 1316 standards of the Leaching Environmental
   Assessment Framework to determine the potential release of phosphorus
   from phosphate waste rocks in different environmental scenarios.
   Phosphorus leaching characteristics were investigated at pH 2.0-13.0 and
   at liquid-to-solid ratios ranging from 0.5 mL/g dry material to 10 mL/g
   dry material. Results indicated that higher amounts of phosphorus were
   likely released from waste rocks in acidic environments than in neutral
   or basic environments. Phosphorus released in acidic environment was
   determined as one or two orders of magnitude greater than that in
   neutral or basic environment. Although the paste pH of waste rocks was
   maintained in a weakly basic range (7.5-9.0) by long-term leaching
   effect, liquid-phase concentrations of phosphorus released by most waste
   rocks exceeded the availability threshold (0.5 mg/L), as influenced by
   short-and long-term leaching. In addition, the chemical equilibrium
   between acid neutralisation capacities of waste rocks and local acid
   rain could be a dominant factor in phosphorus leachability affected by
   long-term leaching. Therefore, phosphate waste rocks deposited in the
   study areas should be considered as phosphorus point pollution sources,
   which could threaten adjacent surface water environments. As such,
   future management practices would be highly effective if water
   infiltration could be prevented and inner environment pH of waste rock
   piles could be maintained at paste pH.}},

   enables the definition of the clearly delimited physical area of
   corridors according to a geometrical threshold width value, as well as

Abstract = {{Geochemical sampling methods are methods which involve collecting and
   analyzing various types of geological materials (such as soils, stream
   sediments and rocks) or certain biological materials (such as plants).
   Stream sediment geochemistry can be used to quantify natural geochemical
   baselines and anthropogenic effects. For stream sediment, pan
   concentrate, and in some cases soil samples, the procedure is often to
   plot all the values on a map, determine an arbitrary or statistical
   threshold and highlight the anomalous values. Kosovo Basin is the
   largest basin in Kosovo covering an area of 1400 km(2). The soils in
   this basin are used mainly for agriculture. Surficial geochemical data
   are important for solving problems in mineral resources, geology,
   agriculture, forestry, waste disposal, and environmental health. This
   study examined the spatial distribution of the following metals in
   stream sediments: arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), mercury
   (Hg), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) are included
   because of their influence on availability of heavy metals to stream
   water or their potential use in interpreting the distribution of heavy
   metals. Most metal concentrations can be spatially related to the
   regional geology, structural trends, or the local effects of individual
   rock units. For each selected elements was created a set of maps
   (combination of post map, contour map, 3D wire frame map and 3D surface
   map). Results obtained using these techniques show some anomalies for
   selected elements in various parts of study area.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed current profiles of organochlorine pollutants in
   sediment of Escambia Bay and River in northwest Florida, United States
   (US), which experienced catastrophic environmental collapse in the 1970s
   as a result of unregulated industrial and domestic sewage releases.
   Fifty-seven composite sediment samples were collected with a ponar grab
   sampler. Organochlorines were extracted with United States Environmental
   Protection Agency (USEPA) Method 3550 and concentrations were determined
   with USEPA Method 1668A for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), USEPA
   Method1613B for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans
   (PCDD/Fs), and USEPA Method 8081A for
   4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT),
   4,4'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), and
   4,4'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE). For PCBs, 12 (21\%) out of
   the 57 samples exceed the Florida threshold effects level (TEL) of 21.6
   mu g/kg and no sample exceeds the Florida probable effects level (PEL)
   of 189 mu g/kg. The 17 PCDD/F congeners that are considered to have
   significant toxicity have a mean of 1.9 mu g/kg and a range of 0.022-11
   mu g/kg. The mean total toxic equivalence value (TEQ) of PCDD/Fs and
   dioxin-like PCBs for the sediments is 2.6 ng/kg. About 56\% of the
   samples exceed the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA) TEL for total TEQ, 23\% of which also exceed the NOAA TEL,
   implying that these total TEQ toxicities can impact sediments adversely.
   DDT was detected in 25\% of the samples. All but one of the detections
   were in the river and adjacent wetlands. The detected DDT concentrations
   exceed the Florida PEL (4.77 mu g/kg) except for one sample that only
   exceeds the TEL (1.19 mu g/kg). The common DDT degradation products, DDD
   and DDE, were not detected in the river and wetland sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Natural resource agencies have established surveillance programs which
   use environmental DNA (eDNA) for the early detection of bighead carp
   Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix
   before they establish populations within the Great Lakes. This molecular
   monitoring technique must be highly accurate and precise for confident
   interpretation and also efficient, both in detection threshold and cost.
   Therefore, we compared two DNA extraction techniques and compared a new
   quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay with the conventional PCR (cPCR) assay
   used by monitoring programs. Both the qPCR and cPCR assays were able to
   amplify the DNA of silver carp present in environmental samples taken
   from locations where mixed populations of bigheaded carps existed.
   However, the qPCR assay had substantially fewer PCR positive samples
   which were subsequently determined not to contain DNA of bigheaded carps
   than the cPCR assay. Additionally, the qPCR assay was able to amplify
   the DNA of bigheaded carps even in the presence of inhibitors that
   blocked amplification with cPCR. Also, the selection of an appropriate
   DNA extraction method can significantly alter the efficiency of eDNA
   surveillance programs by lowering detection limits and by decreasing
   costs associated with sample processing. The results reported herein are
   presently being incorporated into eDNA surveillance programs to decrease
   the costs, increase DNA yield and increase the confidence that assays

Abstract = {{A sustainable society index (SSI) developed by the Sustainable Society
   Foundation (SSF) has been designed to measure the sustainability of 151
   countries over the world in terms of human, environmental and economic
   well-being dimensions. The purpose of SSF's SSI is to share global,
   integrated and scientifically based information and serve as a tool to
   measure the level of sustainability of a country in absolute terms and
   in comparison with other countries. The SSF provided the framework and
   the data for this study. The aims of this study were to test different
   alternatives that would enable to take interactions of the
   sustainability indicators into account and accomplish a more
   non-compensatory composite index, which presents more of a stronger
   sustainability view instead of weak sustainability. The tested methods
   included additive aggregation rule with interaction terms for the
   indicators, multiplicative aggregation rule, weighting of the decision
   hierarchy and constructing piecewise linear models with threshold values
   to calculate the indicator scores for each country from the raw data.
   The acquired results were compared to the redesigned SSI-2012 developed
   by the SSF. According to the results of this study, the new framework
   and geometric mean used as aggregation method in the redesigned SSF's
   SSI-2012 did not fully succeed in its aims towards more non-compensatory
   composite index. The results of the tested methods showed that the most
   useful manner to construct composite indices such as SSI would be the
   use of multiplicative aggregation rule applying weighting based on
   expert elicitation, and constructing new calculation rules with
   thresholds for the indicator scores, thus considering the strong
   sustainable view already at the level of indicator scores. However, all
   these issues need further studying and development including new
   comprehensive weighting task, expert judgment task for determining the

   of the indicator scores.}},

Abstract = {{With ambitious renewable energy targets, pile driving associated with
   offshore wind farm construction will become widespread in the marine
   environment. Many proposed wind farms overlap with the distribution of
   seals, and sound from pile driving has the potential to cause auditory
   damage. We report on a behavioural study during the construction of a
   wind farm using data from GPS/GSM tags on 24 harbour seals Phoca
   vitulina L. Pile driving data and acoustic propagation models, together
   with seal movement and dive data, allowed the prediction of auditory
   damage in each seal. Growth and recovery functions for auditory damage
   were combined to predict temporary auditory threshold shifts in each
   seal. Further, M-weighted cumulative sound exposure levels
   {[}cSELs(M-pw)] were calculated and compared to permanent auditory
   threshold shift exposure criteria for pinnipeds in water exposed to
   pulsed sounds. The closest distance of each seal to pile driving varied
   from 47 to 405km, and predicted maximum cSELs(M-pw) ranged from 1707 to
   1953 dB re 1Pa(2)-s for individual seals. Comparison to exposure
   criteria suggests that half of the seals exceeded estimated permanent
   auditory damage thresholds. Prediction of auditory damage in marine
   mammals is a rapidly evolving field and has a number of key
   uncertainties associated with it. These include how sound propagates in
   shallow water environments and the effects of pulsed sounds on seal
   hearing; as such, our predictions should be viewed in this
   context.Policy implications. We predicted that half of the tagged seals
   received sound levels from pile driving that exceeded auditory damage
   thresholds for pinnipeds. These results have implications for offshore
   industry and will be important for policymakers developing guidance for
   pile driving. Developing engineering solutions to reduce sound levels at
   source or methods to deter animals from damage risk zones, or changing
   temporal patterns of piling could potentially reduce auditory damage
   risk. Future work should focus on validating these predictions by
   collecting auditory threshold information pre- and post-exposure to pile
   driving. Ultimately, information on population-level impacts of exposure
   to pile driving is required to ensure that offshore industry is
   developed in an environmentally sustainable manner.

Abstract = {{Recent increases in both the frequency and severity of coral bleaching
   events have spurred numerous surveys to quantify the immediate impacts

   deploy large teams of scientifically-trained divers. In this study, we
   evaluated the effectiveness of the Along-Track Reef Imaging System
   (ATRIS), an automated image-acquisition technology, for assessing a
   moderate bleaching event that occurred in the summer of 2011 in the
   Florida Keys. More than 100,000 images were collected over 2.7 km of
   transects spanning four patch reefs in a 3-h period. In contrast divers
   completed 18, 10-m long transects at nine patch reefs over a 5-day
   period. Corals were assigned to one of four categories: not bleached,
   pale, partially bleached, and bleached. The prevalence of bleaching
   estimated by ATRIS was comparable to the results obtained by divers, but
   only for corals >41 cm in size. The coral size-threshold computed for
   ATRIS in this study was constrained by prevailing environmental
   conditions (turbidity and sea state) and, consequently, needs to be

Abstract = {{We compared the influence of patch-burn grazing to traditional range
   management practices on abundance of the most economically injurious fly
   parasites of cattle. Horn flies (Haematobia irritans), face flies (Musca
   autumnalis), stable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans), and horse flies
   (Tabanus spp.) were assessed at study locations in Oklahoma and Iowa,
   USA, in 2012 and 2013. Experiments at both locations were spatially
   replicated three times on rangeland grazed by mature Angus cows. Grazing
   was year-long in Oklahoma and seasonal in Iowa from May to September.
   One-third of patch-burn pastures were burned annually, and traditionally
   managed pastures were burned completely in 2012 but not at all in 2013.
   Because of significant location effects, we analyzed locations
   separately with a mixed effects model. Horn flies and face flies were
   below economic thresholds with patch-burn grazing but at or above
   economic thresholds in unburned pastures in Iowa. Pastures in Iowa that
   were burned in their entirety had fewer horn flies but did not have
   fewer face flies when compared with no burning. There was no difference
   among treatments in horn fly or face fly abundance in Oklahoma pastures.
   Stable flies on both treatments at both locations never exceeded the
   economic threshold regardless of treatment. Minimizing hay feeding
   coupled with regular fire could maintain low stable fly infestations.
   Horse flies at both locations and face flies in Oklahoma were in such
   low abundance that treatment differences were difficult to detect or
   explain. The lack of a treatment effect in Oklahoma and variable year
   effects are the result of a drought year followed by a wet year,
   reducing the strength of feedbacks driving grazing behavior on pastures
   burned with patchy fires. Patch-burning or periodically burning entire
   pastures in mesic grasslands is a viable cultural method for managing
   some parasitic flies when drought is not a constraint. (C) 2015 Society

Abstract = {{The management of biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems requires knowing
   the state of water quality linked to regime shifts in various taxonomic
   groups. We examine this question by studying the fish ponds in the
   Dombes region, France. These waterbodies are characterized by a high
   diversity of species. High levels of nutrients due to certain fish
   farming practices may cause significant eutrophication leading to loss
   in biodiversity and a shift from high coverage of aquatic vegetation to
   phytoplankton dominance may also be observed. The aim of this study is
   to assess tipping points, thresholds for effect, along a gradient of
   chlorophyll alpha in different taxonomic groups: aquatic vascular
   plants, phytoplankton, dragonflies and aquatic macro-invertebrates.
   Tipping points are analyzed with three different statistical methods: a
   method which evaluates tipping points with a difference in the mean
   (TMEAN), a second method which evaluates tipping point by comparing the
   mean and linear regressions before and after the tipping point (FSTAT)
   and third a method which evaluates linear regressions with a pivotal
   tipping point (SEGMENTED). We also compare tipping points for the
   different taxonomic groups using five different diversity indices:
   Observed richness, Jackknife first order, Fisher's alpha, Simpson index
   and Evenness.
   Our results show that there is an important variation in tipping points
   following the three statistical methods, but the SEGMENTED is the best
   method for evaluating tipping points. We observe a high difference of
   tipping point values for the different taxonomic groups depending on the
   diversity indices used. Jackknife first order has a better performance
   to evaluate a eutrophic change according to the diversity than the other
   indices.
   In all taxonomic groups, aquatic vascular plants are the most impacted
   by the chlorophyll alpha and almost all their tipping points are
   observed around 60 mu g/L chlorophyll alpha concentrations. No
   significant relationship is found between chlorophyll alpha and
   phytoplankton diversity, while the two other groups, dragonflies and
   macro-invertebrates, are both impacted by the chlorophyll alpha but
   their relevant tipping points are situated in higher values than aquatic
   vascular plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The microbiome of the home is of great interest because of
   its possible impact on health. Our goal was to identify some of the
   factors that determine the richness, evenness and diversity of the
   home's fungal and bacterial microbiomes.
   Method: Vacuumed settled dust from homes (n=35) in Cincinnati, OH, were
   analyzed by pyrosequencing to determine the fungal and bacterial
   relative sequence occurrence. The correlation coefficients between home
   environmental characteristics, including age of home, Environmental
   Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values, occupant number, relative
   humidity and temperature, as well as pets (dog and cat) were evaluated
   for their influence on fungal and bacterial communities. In addition,
   linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used for identifying fungal and
   bacterial genera and species associated with those housing determinants
   found to be significant.
   Results: The fungal richness was found to be positively correlated with
   age of home (p =0.002), ERMI value (p=0.003), and relative humidity
   (p=0.015) in the home. However, fungal evenness and diversity were only
   correlated with the age of home (p =0.001). Diversity and evenness (not
   richness) of the bacterial microbiome in the homes were associated with
   dog ownership.
   Linear discriminant analysis showed total of 39 putative fungal
   genera/species with significantly higher LDA scores in high ERMI homes
   and 47 genera/species with significantly higher LDA scores in homes with
   high relative humidity. When categorized according to the age of the
   home, a total of 67 fungal genera/species had LDA scores above the
   significance threshold. Dog ownership appeared to have the most
   influence on the bacterial microbiome, since a total of 130 bacterial
   genera/species had significantly higher LDA scores in homes with dogs.
   Conclusions: Some key determinants of the fungal and bacterial
   microbiome appear to be excess moisture, age of the home and dog
   ownership. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Environmental pollution has become an issue of serious international
   concern in recent years. Among the receptor-oriented pollution models,
   CMB, PMF, UNMIX, and PCA are widely used as source apportionment models.
   To improve the accuracy of source apportionment and classify the sample
   data for these models, this study proposes an easy-to-use,
   high-dimensional EPC algorithm that not only organizes all of the sample
   data into different groups according to the similarities in pollution
   characteristics such as pollution sources and concentrations but also
   simultaneously detects outliers. The main clustering process consists of
   selecting the first unlabelled point as the cluster centre, then
   assigning each data point in the sample dataset to its most similar
   cluster centre according to both the user-defined threshold and the
   value of similarity function in each iteration, and finally modifying
   the clusters using a method similar to k-Means. The validity and
   accuracy of the algorithm are tested using both real and synthetic
   datasets, which makes the EPC algorithm practical and effective for
   appropriately classifying sample data for source apportionment models
   and helpful for better understanding and interpreting the sources of
   pollution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme climatic events can trigger abrupt and often lasting change in
   ecosystems via the reduction or elimination of foundation (i.e.,
   habitat-forming) species. However, while the frequency/intensity of
   extreme events is predicted to increase under climate change, the impact
   of these events on many foundation species and the ecosystems they
   support remains poorly understood. Here, we use the iconic seagrass
   meadows of Shark Bay, Western Australia - a relatively pristine
   subtropical embayment whose dominant, canopy-forming seagrass,
   Amphibolis antarctica, is a temperate species growing near its
   low-latitude range limit - as a model system to investigate the impacts
   of extreme temperatures on ecosystems supported by thermally sensitive
   foundation species in a changing climate. Following an unprecedented
   marine heat wave in late summer 2010/11, A. antarctica experienced
   catastrophic (>90\%) dieback in several regions of Shark Bay.
   Animal-borne video footage taken from the perspective of resident,
   seagrass-associated megafauna (sea turtles) revealed severe habitat
   degradation after the event compared with a decade earlier. This
   reduction in habitat quality corresponded with a decline in the health
   status of largely herbivorous green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in the
   2years following the heat wave, providing evidence of long-term,
   community-level impacts of the event. Based on these findings, and
   similar examples from diverse ecosystems, we argue that a generalized
   framework for assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems to abrupt change
   associated with the loss of foundation species is needed to accurately
   predict ecosystem trajectories in a changing climate. This includes
   seagrass meadows, which have received relatively little attention in
   this context. Novel research and monitoring methods, such as the
   analysis of habitat and environmental data from animal-borne video and
   data-logging systems, can make an important contribution to this
   framework.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{833-843}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Ongoing population growth and economic development place increasing
   demands on the supply of services produced in and by ecosystems. The
   resulting degradation compromises their ability to continue supporting
   the provision of these services. As ecosystem services (ESs) are closely
   related to land use changes, studies linking these topics are critical
   in the context of better land use planning and to ensure the sustainable
   provision of ESs.
   The impacts of various land uses on ESs occur in three ways: (1) Major
   ESs are generated under different land use practices, (2) land use
   patterns have a significant impact on ESs, and (3) differing intensities
   of land use may have different impacts on the generation of ESs. As
   human needs for different ESs vary and are not always consistent,
   maximizing the use of one ES can lead to a sharp decline in other ESs
   that may exceed a threshold inducing irreversible change. Therefore,
   trade-offs between ESs have become challenges that the ecosystem
   planning and management community must address. Furthermore, other
   problems (such as a lack of reliable data, inconsistent evaluation
   methods, and a lack of validated results used in assessments of ESs)
   compound the difficulty of this challenge. The development of
   comprehensive assessment models that result from an integrated
   assessment and scenario analysis of ESs under different land uses can
   inform ecosystem management options.
   Studies of ESs under different types of land use change must enhance
   understanding of topics that link ecosystem processes with ESs.
   Recommended research includes enhancement of the management practices of
   soil and land, modeling and mapping the spatial flow of ESs, analyzing
   trade-offs and synergies between multiple ESs, and integrating and
   optimizing analyses of ESs. By understanding the ecological processes
   that drive ESs and how these are affected by land use change, we can
   establish a sustainable balance between multiple uses of different ESs.}},

Abstract = {{Image analysis of fractal geometry can be used to gain deeper insights

   features a data-mining opportunity based on a comprehensive collection
   of 11 different mathematical methods to compute fractal dimension that
   are implemented into a wizard design to maximize ease-of-use for
   semi-automatic analysis of single images or fully automatic analysis of
   multiple images in a batch process. As examples of application,
   quantitative analyses of fractal dimension were used to optimize the
   important variable settings of brightness threshold and minimum object
   size in order to discriminate the complex architecture of freshwater
   microbial biofilms at multiple spatial scales, and also to differentiate
   the spatial patterns of individual bacterial cells that influence their
   cooperative interactions, resource use, and apportionment in situ.
   Version 1.0 of JFrad is implemented into a software package containing
   the program files, user manual, and tutorial images that will be freely
   available at http://cme.msu.edu/cmeias/. This improvement in

Abstract = {{In this study, biological methods (biostimulation and bioaugmentation)
   were used to treat oil tank bottom sludge contaminated soils to total
   petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) levels suitable for landfill disposal. The
   sludge's hydrocarbon-degrading microbial capacities were initially
   compared to those from other contaminated environments using
   culture-based methods. Results indicated that a fungus, Scedosporium
   dominated the sludge microbial community. Its application in a nutrient
   formulation resulted in greater reduction in oil tank bottom sludge
   viscosity (44 \%) and residual soil hydrocarbon compared to
   hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms from other sources (26.7 \% reduction
   in viscosity). Subsequent field-based experiments showed greater TPH
   reduction (54 \%) in fungal-nutrient-treated sludge-waste soils than in
   naturally attenuated controls (22 \%) over 49 days. 16S ribosomal
   ribonucleic acid and internal transcribed spacer region-based polymerase
   chain reactions and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses
   showed minimal effects on the microbial communities during this time.
   TPH reduction to landfill disposal levels occurred at a slower rate
   after this, falling below the 10,000 mg kg(-1) legislated TPH disposal
   threshold earlier in amended samples (91.2 \%; 9,500 mg kg(-1)) compared
   to the control (82 \%; 17,000 mg kg(-1)) in 182 days. The results show
   that the intrinsic hydrocarbon-degrading microbial capacities in sludge
   are better suited for sludge degradation than those from other sources.
   The substantial TPH reduction observed in control samples demonstrates
   the beneficial effects of natural attenuation with waste soils for oil
   tank sludge treatment. Microbial capacities in sludge and treated waste
   soils can therefore be successfully employed for treating oil tank
   bottom sludge.}},

Abstract = {{Plastic-mulched landcover (PML) is the land surface covered by thin
   plastic films. PML has been expanding rapidly worldwide and has formed a
   significant agriculture landscape in the last two decades. Large-scale
   PML may impact the regional and global climate, ecosystem, and
   environment because it changes the energy balance and water cycles of
   the land surfaces, reduces the biodiversity, deteriorates the soil
   structure, etc. To study its impact, the spatial and temporal
   distributions and dynamics of PML have to be obtained. This paper
   presents a threshold model (TM) for PML detection and mapping with
   moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data.
   Based on the temporal-spectral features of PML in the early stage of a
   growing season after planting, a TM was designed with the number of days
   (d) when the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value is
   larger than a threshold value (x) as the discriminator. The model has
   been successfully applied to map PML in southern Xinjiang, China, from
   the interpolated MODIS NDVI time series (from 90th to 125th day of each
   year). Results indicate that when TM parameter x is set to 0.2 and d to
   8, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient (kappa) are >0.84 and
   0.65, respectively. We believe this classification accuracy can meet the
   PML mapping for large geographic areas. Furthermore, visual comparison
   between the PML maps from TM classification of MODIS time series and
   that from the maximum likelihood classification of Landsat ETM+ and OLI
   images shows they are consistent both in the pattern and location of
   PML. Therefore, detection and mapping of PML by using MODIS time series
   with the TM method is feasible. The PML mapping in this study used a
   cropland mask derived from Landsat images using a maximum likelihood
   classifier to mask out non-cropland when applying the TM algorithm. The
   accuracy of such a mask is subject to further study. Because of frequent
   global coverages of MODIS data, the method presented in this paper could
   potentially be used for PML detecting and mapping at continental and
   global scales. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative

Abstract = {{Uncertainties in the spectral remote-sensing reflectance for SeaWiFS and
   MODIS-Aqua are characterized based on globally distributed data sets of
   in situ/satellite matchups. The in situ data sets were derived from
   fixed mooring sites and ship data using a variety of field radiometers.
   An optical classification procedure was applied to the satellite
   reflectance from each matchup pair to derive its fuzzy membership to
   eight previously characterized, optical water types. The memberships
   were then used as weights to derive uncertainty measures for the optical
   water types. The resulting uncertainty measures are shown to vary by
   optical water type for both sensors. Overall, the root-mean-square
   difference (RMSD) for open ocean waters is low and diminishes with
   increasing wavelength. The RMSD increases with optical complexity and is
   the highest in coastal waters associated with highly absorbing or highly
   scattering conditions. Although it plays a small role in RMSD, a
   spectral bias with a distinct zigzag pattern was detected across all
   water types. The most sensitive measure associated with optical water
   types is the relative uncertainty, which is shown to be near the desired
   5\% threshold for much of the open ocean for both SeaWiFS and
   MODIS-Aqua, but exceeds 50\% in waters where the reflectance signal is
   low. This approach provides an objective method for characterizing
   uncertainty in water environments with distinct optical properties, and
   the results can be used in the processing of future satellite data to
   derive their associated uncertainty fields. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Fisheries bycatch is a global threat to marine megafauna. Environmental
   laws require bycatch assessment for protected species, but this is
   difficult when bycatch is rare. Low bycatch rates, combined with low
   observer coverage, may lead to biased, imprecise estimates when using
   standard ratio estimators. Bayesian model-based approaches incorporate
   uncertainty, produce less volatile estimates, and enable probabilistic
   evaluation of estimates relative to management thresholds. Here, we
   demonstrate a pragmatic decision-making process that uses Bayesian
   model-based inferences to estimate the probability of exceeding
   management thresholds for bycatch in fisheries with <100\% observer
   coverage. Using the California drift gillnet fishery as a case study, we
   (1) model rates of rare-event bycatch and mortality using Bayesian
   Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation methods and 20 years of observer
   data; (2) predict unobserved counts of bycatch and mortality; (3) infer
   expected annual mortality; (4) determine probabilities of mortality
   exceeding regulatory thresholds; and (5) classify the fishery as having
   low, medium, or high bycatch impact using those probabilities. We
   focused on leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) and humpback
   whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Candidate models included Poisson or
   zero-inflated Poisson likelihood, fishing effort, and a bycatch rate
   that varied with area, time, or regulatory regime. Regulatory regime had
   the strongest effect on leatherback bycatch, with the highest levels
   occurring prior to a regulatory change. Area had the strongest effect on
   humpback bycatch. Cumulative bycatch estimates for the 20-year period
   were 104-242 leatherbacks (52-153 deaths) and 6-50 humpbacks (0-21
   deaths). The probability of exceeding a regulatory threshold under the
   U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (Potential Biological Removal, PBR) of
   0.113 humpback deaths was 0.58, warranting a medium bycatch impact
   classification of the fishery. No PBR thresholds exist for leatherbacks,
   but the probability of exceeding an anticipated level of two deaths per
   year, stated as part of a U.S. Endangered Species Act assessment
   process, was 0.0007. The approach demonstrated here would allow managers
   to objectively and probabilistically classify fisheries with respect to
   bycatch impacts on species that have population-relevant mortality
   reference points, and declare with a stipulated level of certainty that
   bycatch did or did not exceed estimated upper bounds.}},

Abstract = {{A high-resolution (HR) numerical model for solving 1D shallow water

   is widely used for modeling debris flows. The evaluation tests reveal
   that the present method yields numerically stable and efficient
   solutions of debris flows moving downslope with significant basal
   friction. The application to two debris flows that were experimentally
   generated with a fixed-volume and a continuous source reveals that the
   numerical model reproduces the propagation speed of debris flow on the
   slopes and the deposition pattern on the fan with reasonable accuracy.
   Overall results indicate that the present model can provide useful
   information on transient features of debris flow behavior through the
   channel with an abrupt change in bottom slope. (C) 2014 International

Abstract = {{Given the significant land holdings of the U.S. Department of Defense,
   and the importance of those lands to support a variety of inherently
   damaging activities, application of sound natural resource conservation
   principles and proactive monitoring practices are necessary to manage
   military training lands in a sustainable manner. This study explores a
   method for, and the utility of, analyzing vegetation condition and
   trends as sustainability indicators for use by military commanders and
   land managers, at both the national and local levels, in identifying
   when and where vegetation-related environmental impacts might exist. The
   BFAST time series decomposition method was applied to a ten-year MODIS
   NDVI time series dataset for the Fort Riley military installation and
   Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) in northeastern Kansas. Imagery
   selected for time-series analysis were 16-day MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1
   Collection 5) composites capable of characterizing vegetation change
   induced by human activities and climate variability. Three indicators
   related to gradual interannual or abrupt intraannual vegetation change
   for each pixel were calculated from the trend component resulting from
   the BFAST decomposition. Assessment of gradual interannual NDVI trends
   showed the majority of Fort Riley experienced browning between 2001 and
   2010. This result is supported by validation using high spatial
   resolution imagery. The observed versus expected frequency of linear
   trends detected at Fort Riley and KPBS were significantly different and
   suggest a causal link between military training activities and/or land
   management practices. While both sites were similar with regards to
   overall disturbance frequency and the relative spatial extents of
   monotonic or interrupted trends, vegetation trajectories after
   disturbance were significantly different. This suggests that the type
   and magnitude of disturbances characteristic of each location result in
   distinct post-disturbance vegetation responses. Using a remotely-sensed
   vegetation index time series with BFAST and the indicators outlined here
   provides a consistent and relatively rapid assessment of military
   training lands with applicability outside of grassland biomes.
   Characterizing overall trends and disturbance responses of vegetation
   can promote sustainable use of military lands and assist land managers
   in targeting specific areas for various rehabilitation activities. (C)

Abstract = {{Tourism development in protected areas inevitably induces a decline in

   result of tourism. In this study, we used regression analysis and
   habitat suitability curve method to determine the number of tourists

   that would negatively impact the survival of protected fishes. A
   regression model indicated that of the ten water quality parameters

   curve was produced for each target fish population and water quality
   parameter. These curves were used to determine suitable water quality

   acceptable number of tourists for management of water quality suitable

Abstract = {{Mining impacts on stream systems have historically been studied over
   small spatial scales, yet investigations over large areas may be useful
   for characterizing mining as a regional source of stress to stream
   fishes. The associations between co-occurring stream fish assemblages
   and densities of various ``classes{''} of mining occurring in the same
   catchments were tested using threshold analysis. Threshold analysis
   identifies the point at which fish assemblages change substantially from
   best available habitat conditions with increasing disturbance. As this
   occurred over large regions, species comprising fish assemblages were
   represented by various functional traits as well as other measures of
   interest to management (characterizing reproductive ecology and life
   history, habitat preferences, trophic ecology, assemblage diversity and
   evenness, tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance and state-recognized
   game species). We used two threshold detection methods: change-point
   analysis with indicator analysis and piecewise linear regression. We
   accepted only those thresholds that were highly statistically
   significant (p <= 0.01) for both techniques and overlapped within <5\%
   error. We found consistent, wedge-shaped declines in multiple fish
   metrics with increasing levels of mining in catchments, suggesting mines
   are a regional source of disturbance. Threshold responses were
   consistent across the three ecoregions occurring at low mine densities.
   For 47.2\% of the significant thresholds, a density of only <= 0.01
   mines/km(2) caused a threshold response. In fact, at least 25\% of
   streams in each of our three study ecoregions have mine densities in
   their catchments with the potential to affect fish assemblages. Compared
   to other anthropogenic impacts assessed over large areas (agriculture,
   impervious surface or urban land use), mining had a more pronounced and
   consistent impact on fish assemblages. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Ecosystem dynamics are often influenced by both environmental and

   has resulted in global declines of targeted species, which are often
   managed under a single-species paradigm that does not fully incorporate
   ecosystem considerations such as ecological interactions or

   more holistic approach that concurrently addresses human, ecological,
   and environmental factors influencing living marine resources and
   evaluates these considerations collectively on a system level. For EBFM,
   reference points associated with management action need to be
   quantified. Methods have been developed to assign decision criteria to
   ecological indicators' response to human-use pressures, yet few efforts
   have established decision criteria in response to the combined influence
   of human-use and environmental pressures. We translated ecological
   indicator response into a surface dependent on both fishing and
   environmental pressures. Using generalized additive models, we
   empirically determined critical points at which a small change in
   fishing and environmental pressure results in an abrupt change in
   ecosystem status. For the Northeast United States Shelf Large Marine

Abstract = {{Acoustic deterrent devices (ADDs) have often been considered a benign
   solution to managing pinniped predation. However, ADDs have also been
   highlighted as a conservation concern since they can inflict large-scale
   habitat exclusion in toothed whales (odontocetes). We tested a new
   method that selectively inflicted startle responses in harbour seals
   (Phoca vitulina) at close ranges to the loudspeaker but not in a
   non-target species, the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), by using a
   frequency range where porpoise hearing was less sensitive than that of
   phocid seals. The sound exposure consisted of isolated 200ms long, 2-3
   octave-band noise pulses with a peak frequency of 1kHz, which were
   presented at a source level of approximate to 180dB re 1Pa. Field tests
   were carried out within a 2-month period on a fish farm on the west
   coast of Scotland where marine mammal behaviour was observed within
   three distance categories. Seal numbers dropped sharply during sound
   exposure compared with control observation periods within 250m of the
   sound source but were unaffected at distances further away from the
   farm. A Poisson regression model revealed that the number of seal tracks
   within 250m of the device decreased by approximate to 91\% during sound
   exposure and was primarily influenced by sound exposure with no evidence
   for a change in the effect of treatment such as habituation, throughout
   the experiment. In contrast to seals, there was no shift in the number
   of porpoise groups in each distance category as a result of sound
   exposure and porpoises were regularly seen close to the device. We also
   sighted six common minke whales during sound exposure while only one was
   seen during control periods. Our data demonstrate that the startle
   method can be used to selectively deter seals without affecting
   porpoises.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy metal pollution in soil is a growing concern, and little is known
   about how it is distributed in the soils of different districts with
   different land uses on a broad scale. A total of 873 surface soil
   samples (0- to 20-cm depth) were collected in the Huishan and Xin
   districts of Wuxi City. The pollution levels and sources of heavy metals
   in the two districts were identified using multivariate statistics and
   spatial analysis methods, and the results are discussed in this paper.
   The concentration of heavy metals in soils, particularly Hg, was higher
   in Xin, where there are many industrial parks. The concentrations of As,
   Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn were higher than the corresponding background values
   in the two districts, and the soil Hg in Xin exceeded the grade II
   threshold value of the Chinese Environmental Quality Standard for Soils.
   Natural resources (e.g., geogenic and pedogenic factors) were
   predominately responsible for the heavy metal concentration in Huishan
   soils, but anthropogenic activities (industrial production and
   discharge) were the primary factors for soil heavy metal pollution in
   Xin. The soil heavy metal concentration in forestlands was high in
   Huishan, and among these metals Hg and As reached a moderate level of
   pollution {[}enrichment factor (EF) > 2]. No pollution or minimal
   pollution happened in response to other land uses. In Xin, the Hg in
   cultivated land, rural-residential land, and underwater sediments
   reached a moderate level of pollution (EF > 2), and the other heavy
   metal levels were low (EF < 2) in response to different land uses.}},

Abstract = {{Quantity and quality distribution of surface water and groundwater are
   changing under the impacts of both climate variability and human
   activities. The main goal of this paper is to evaluate the
   abovementioned impacts on the water resources in the Saveh plain,
   central Iran. To achieve this aim, spatial and temporal changes of the
   surface and groundwater quality and quantity have been analyzed, using
   hydrometric and meteorological data. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test
   was used to identify trends and change points in the annual rainfall and
   runoff for the period of 1946 to 2011. In order to analyze the impacts
   of the Saveh Dam on runoff, the dam operation year, 1994, was considered
   as a change point. Mann-Kendall test results show that rainfall time
   series was divided into two parts, namely, 1966-1989 and 1990-2007, and
   averages of annual rainfall in five stations increase from 10 to 21 \%.
   Also, runoff time series was divided into two parts, namely, 1946-1995
   and 1996-2007 and averages of annual runoff in four stations decrease
   from 8 to 83 \%. Results show that rainfall changes in Shahabasi, Razin,
   Jalayer, Emamabad, and Ahmadabad stations increased from 9 to 33\%
   before and after 1994. Nevertheless, runoff decreased from 24 to 81 \%.
   The results indicate that the greatest lack of runoff between stations
   is at Shahabasi station and one important reason for the severe lack is
   operation of the Saveh Dam in 1994. Highest groundwater level decline,
   about 168.67 cm, occurred in 1994 that is the operation year of the
   Saveh Dam. Trend analysis of surface water quality show that electrical
   conductivity increased 957.34 mu mho/cm before and after 1994. Also, the
   Wilcox water quality classification method has been reduced from C3-S1
   to C4-S2. Average groundwater electrical conductivity (EC) during
   1999-2003 and 2004-2009 increased to 89.6 mu mho/cm. Also, the
   groundwater quality indices for agricultural usages are classified in
   four classes including, C4-S2 16, C4-S1 46, C3-S1 30, and C2-S1 8 \% of
   the total aquifer area. In conclusion, in order to have a sustainable
   development, the effects of water projects on environment and water
   resources need to be predicted very carefully.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Polydilorobiphenyls (PCBs) are persistent pollutants that
   are widespread in the environment and in foodstuffs, particularly in
   freshwater fish, which frequently exceed the maximum levels set by
   European regulations. Objectives: First, we describe the consumption of
   freshwater fish and serum PCB levels in French anglers, a population
   expected to have the highest level of dietary PCB exposure. Second, we
   investigated whether there is a statistical relationship between serum
   PCB levels and the angler consumption of freshwater fish with high PCB
   bioaccumulation potential (PCB-BP+ freshwater fish) in order to make
   recommendations with regard to safe consumption of freshwater fish.
   Methods: We conducted a survey of anglers from six sites with
   contrasting PCB contamination levels. The survey included a food
   consumption frequency questionnaire and blood samples were taken to
   assess serum PCB levels. We used a regression model to determine the
   main factors contributing to serum PCB levels.
   Results: Consumption of PCB-BP+ freshwater fish was relatively
   infrequent. Serum PCB levels of the study population and of women of
   childbearing age were in the same range as those observed in the French
   population and in neighbouring European countries, but higher than in
   the North American population.
   The two factors with the highest positive association with serum PCB
   levels were age (R-2 = 61\%) and the consumption of PCB-BP+ freshwater
   fish (R2 = 2\%). Using the regression model, we calculated, for several
   scenarios depending on the age and gender of the population, the maximum
   annual frequencies for PCB-BP+ freshwater fish consumption that do not
   exceed the critical body burden threshold.
   Conclusion: Following the results of this study, the French agency for
   food, environmental and occupational health and safety (ANSES) issued an
   opinion and recommended some specific maximum freshwater fish
   consumption frequencies to protect the French general population. (C)

Abstract = {{The assessment of the water losses by actual evapotranspiration plays a
   very important role in water resources management, especially in
   particular environments suffering soil water stresses and water
   shortages. The rationales of this study are the scarcity of experimental
   data, the difficulties in the measurement of direct and continuous
   evapotranspiration fluxes, and the switching between controls by climate
   and soil water availability. The temporal patterns of observed soil
   moisture and air temperature of over three years at an experimental site
   in southern Italy have been analyzed to investigate the relation between
   them and the actual evapotranspiration volume, estimated using the soil
   water budget method. To this end, an event-based empirical analysis has
   been performed, exploring the relation between the mentioned variables.
   One of the major findings of the explorative phase is the qualitative
   and quantitative identification of the switching between climate and
   soil water balance as the controls over actual evapotranspiration at the
   experimental site. This threshold process has then been modelled at the
   event and sub-event scale, establishing simple empirical equations to
   predict actual evapotranspiration losses as a function of soil water
   content. Multilevel-recorded data also allowed the investigation of the
   importance of soil depth.}},

Abstract = {{It is well documented that a sustainable system is based on
   environmental stewardship, economic viability, and social equity. What
   is often overlooked is the need for continuity such that desirable
   system behavior is maintained with mechanisms in place that facilitate
   the ability of core system functions to endure or adapt (in the face of
   perturbations), and ensure that future generations are able to meet
   their needs. Assessing regional systems poses unique challenges in that
   they are interlinked with larger- and smaller-scale dynamics that may
   dramatically affect trends in key system variables. From 1970-2009,
   Puerto Rico experienced a 140\% increase in urban population which may
   have amplified impacts related to resource demands, waste production,
   and natural habitats. Because such changes can have strong implications
   for sustainability, the dynamics of Puerto Rico provide a great
   opportunity to explore methods for assessing the sustainability of a
   complex geographic region. In this work, we employ Fisher information,
   an information theory-based approach, to evaluate changes in system
   dynamics and examine the effect of regionalization impacts on trends in
   variables characterizing social, environmental, and economic aspects of
   the system. Results indicate dramatic change from 1981-1999, after which
   the system dynamics remained steady until 2005. While there was no
   indication that a regime shift occurred, system trends corresponded with
   variations in non-yield economic variables. To determine whether Fisher
   information provides warning signals of critical change, consecutive
   declines in the index were explored and demonstrated as a possible
   leading indicator of impending regime shifts.}},

Abstract = {{Canopy stomatal conductance is an important parameter in

   environmental factors and developing mechanism-based models of forest
   transpiration can offer a theoretical basis for reasonable afforestation

   heat balance methods were adopted to measure sap flow of two tree
   species (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica and Populus bolleana Lauche) in
   Ningxia province, China, from May to October 2011. The related
   environmental factors were simultaneously observed. The obtained data
   were applied to the Jarivs-type model and the model did accurately
   simulate the diurnal patterns of stomata! conductance. Time lags in
   canopy transpiration during the measurement period were 60120 minutes.
   The stomatal conductance of both tree species were responded to
   environmental factors following nonlinear pattern. In Pinus sylvestris
   var. mongolica model, photosynthetic active radiation was the main
   driving factor with the driving threshold of 0--0.1 m mol m(2) s(-1).
   The canopy vapour pressure deficit was another limiting factor which was
   negatively correlated to the canopy stomatal conductance when relative
   extractable water was less than 60\%. In Populus bolleana Lauche model,
   the optimal air temperature for stomatal opening was 22 degrees C. The
   canopy stomatal conductance values became less sensitive and the canopy
   vapour pressure deficit was the dominant driving force at solar

   population growth, one-off biological indicators, population trend
   methods, harvest-based indicators, and comparisons of demographic
   parameters between sites. These traditional biological sustainability
   indices have proved inadequate for measuring the impact of bushmeat
   hunting because sustainability is treated as a static, binary (yes or
   no) question, thus ignoring stochastic processes, the inherent
   variability of natural systems, and the complexity of hunting systems.
   We suggest that bushmeat hunting systems in tropical areas should be
   regarded as social-ecological systems in which the impacts of hunting on
   prey populations are not the only focus. Instead, the analysis of
   resilience aims at understanding the complex and dynamic relationships
   between the hunting ground, its resources, the stakeholders, and the
   different exogenous drivers of change that affect the components of the
   system at different scales. The main implication of using the resilience
   theory in the context of bushmeat hunting is the shift from the need to
   assess stocks with imprecise measures to the incorporation of the
   uncertainty and stochasticity inherent to complex systems in
   participatory and adaptive management processes. As such, the resilience
   analysis provides an unprecedented opportunity for the sustainable use
   of bushmeat and allows the identification of strategies to strengthen
   resilience when the system is found to be close to a given threshold,
   instead of reinforcing fortress conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Global climate change affects not only temperature but also the

   from 38 CONAGUA (National Water Commission) weather stations located in
   the Mexican states of Sinaloa, Baja California Sur, Durango, Sonora, and
   Chihuahua. The magnitude of change trends of average, maximum, and
   minimum temperature and precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and
   the aridity index were calculated. The data were aggregated, and the
   Maim-Kendall statistic calculated using the MOCLIC 1.0 program, to
   determine whether there was continuity in the data from each station and
   to define the magnitude of the statistically significant trend under the
   threshold alpha=0.05. The magnitude of the change trend was determined
   for significant trends using Sen's method of slopes. Potential
   evapotranspiration and the aridity index were calculated by the
   Hargreaves and UNEP methods. The results show that the climate variables
   displayed positive and negative trends; mainly temperature, with a range
   of -0.13 to 0.16 degrees C.yr(-1), which is above world averages. The
   values obtained for RMSE, bias, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r)
   and the coefficient of determination (R-2) do not show significant
   differences between the control values and the calculated values. It was
   concluded that aggregating significant trends can provide information on
   the direction of local climate change in this environment in northern
   Mexico, and its important consequences and repercussions, as well as
   impacts on social and environmental systems.}},

Title = {{To die or not to die: early warnings of tree dieback in response to a
   severe drought}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{103}},

Pages = {{44-57}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Some disturbances can drive ecological systems to abrupt shifts
   between alternative stages (tipping points) when critical transitions
   occur. Drought-induced tree death can be considered as a nonlinear shift
   in tree vigour and growth. However, at what point do trees become
   predisposed to drought-related dieback and which factors determine this
   (tipping) point? We investigated these questions by characterizing the
   responses of three tree species, silver fir (Abies alba), Scots pine
   (Pinus sylvestris) and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), to a severe
   drought event.
   2. We compared basal area increment (BAI) trends and responses to
   climate and drought in declining (very defoliated and dying) vs.
   non-declining (slightly or not defoliated) trees by using generalized
   additive mixed models. Defoliation, BAI and sapwood production were
   related to functional proxies of tree vigour measured at the onset and
   end of the drought (non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, needle N
   content and C isotopic discrimination, presence of wood-inhabiting
   fungi). We evaluated whether early warning signals (increases in
   synchronicity among trees or in autocorrelation and standard deviation)
   could be extracted from the BAI series prior to tree death.
   3. Declining silver fir and Scots pine trees showed less growth than
   non-declining trees one to three decades, respectively, before the
   drought event, whereas Aleppo pines showed growth decline irrespective
   of tree defoliation. At the end of the drought period, all species
   showed increased defoliation and a related reduction in the
   concentration of sapwood soluble sugars. Defoliation was constrained by
   the BAI of the previous 5 years and sapwood production. No specific
   wood-inhabiting fungi were found in post-drought declining trees apart
   from blue-stain fungi, which extensively affected damaged Scots pines.
   Declining silver firs showed increases in BAI autocorrelation and
   variability prior to tree death.
   4. Synthesis. Early warning signals of drought-triggered mortality seem
   to be species specific and reflect how different tree species cope with
   drought stress. Highly correlated declining growth patterns during
   drought can serve as a signal in silver fir, whereas changes in the
   content of sapwood soluble sugars are suitable vigour proxies for Scots
   and Aleppo pines. Longer growth and defoliation series, additional
   vigour parameters and multi-species comparisons are required to
   understand and predict drought-induced tree death.}},

Title = {{Assessment of vulnerability to climate change using a multi-criteria

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{Climate change vulnerability assessment is a complex form of risk
   assessment which accounts for both geophysical and socio-economic
   components of risk. In indicator-based vulnerability assessment (IBVA),
   indicators are used to rank the vulnerabilities of socio-ecological
   systems (SESs). The predominant aggregation approach in the literature,
   sometimes based on multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT), typically
   builds a global-scale, utility function based on weighted summation, to
   generate rankings. However, the corresponding requirement for additive
   independence and complete knowledge of system interactions by analyst
   are rarely if ever satisfied in IBVA.
   We build an analogy between the structures of Multi-Criteria Decision
   Analysis (MCDA) and IBVA problems and show that a set of techniques
   called Outranking Methods, developed in MCDA to deal with criteria
   incommensurability, data uncertainty and preference imprecision, offer
   IBVA a sound alternative to additive or multiplicative aggregation. We
   reformulate IBVA problems within an outranking framework, define
   thresholds of difference and use an outranking method, ELECTRE III, to
   assess the relative vulnerability to heat stress of 15 local government
   areas in metropolitan Sydney. We find that the ranking outcomes are
   robust and argue that an outranking approach is better suited for
   assessments characterized by a mix of qualitative, semi-quantitative and
   quantitative indicators, threshold effects and uncertainties about the
   exact relationships between indicators and vulnerability. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Inorganic arsenic is one of the most common naturally
   occurring contaminants found in the environment. Arsenic is associated
   with a number of health outcomes, with epigenetic modification suggested
   as a potential mechanism of toxicity. Objective: Among a sample of 400
   adult participants, we evaluated the association between arsenic
   exposure, as measured by blood and urinary total arsenic concentrations,
   and epigenome-wide white blood cell DNA methylation.
   METHODS: We used linear regression models to examine the associations
   between arsenic exposure and methylation at each CpG site, adjusted for
   sex, age, and batch. Differentially methylated loci were subsequently
   examined in relation to corresponding gene expression for functional
   evidence of gene regulation.
   RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, we observed four differentially
   methylated CpG sites with urinary total arsenic concentration and three
   differentially methylated CpG sites with blood arsenic concentration,
   based on the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of p < 1 x
   10(-7). Methylation of PLA2G2C (probe cg04605617) was the most
   significantly associated locus in relation to both urinary (p = 3.40 x
   10(-11)) and blood arsenic concentrations (p = 1.48 x 10(-11)). Three
   additional novel methylation loci-SQSTM1 (cg01225779), SLC4A4
   (cg06121226), and IGH (cg13651690)-were also significantly associated
   with arsenic exposure. Further, there was evidence of
   methylation-related gene regulation based on gene expression for a
   subset of differentially methylated loci.
   CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant associations between arsenic
   exposure and gene-specific differential white blood cell DNA
   methylation, suggesting that epi-genetic modifications may be an
   important pathway under-lying arsenic toxicity. The specific
   differentially methylated loci identified may inform potential pathways
   for future interventions.}},

Volume = {{112}},

Pages = {{98-108}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A large karst area of South-Eastern Italy (Puglia) is characterized by
   endorheic basins, whose runoff does not discharge into the sea but
   converges toward internal lowlands and infiltrates or flows into
   underground cave systems through swallow holes. In such environment
   whenever intense rainfall events cover large areas and rainfall
   intensity exceeds the discharge capacity of sinks and swallow holes,
   significant volumes of runoff are produced and stored on surface causing
   floods and risks for people and goods. Most of these sinks are often at
   the end of small independent basins delimited by weak divides and,
   whenever water storage exceeds the overflow threshold, runoff
   contributes to downstream areas and, in cascade, large areas may
   contribute to deepest lowlands.
   The observation of historical flood events suggests that in such areas
   traditional methods for the individuation of the design flood event, and
   in particular of critical rainfall duration, lack of applicability and
   the worst rainfall condition, for a fixed return time, should be
   searched accounting for soil hydraulic behaviour and groundwater
   dynamics. In this paper a rationale for the evaluation of the critical
   rainfall event and of the flood-prone area for given return period is
   proposed. A case study is presented showing that for high return period
   events a ``multiple-reservoirs{''} mechanism is activated that affects
   the critical rainfall condition as well as the flood extent in the urban
   areas. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We examined how individual and area socio-demographic
   characteristics independently modified the extreme heat (EH)-mortality
   association among elderly residents of 8 Michigan cities, May-September,
   1990-2007.
   Methods: In a time-stratified case-crossover design, we regressed
   cause-specific mortality against EH (indicator for 4-day mean, minimum,
   maximum or apparent temperature above 97th or 99th percentiles). We
   examined effect modification with interactions between EH and personal
   marital status, age, race, sex and education and ZIP-code percent
   ``non-green space{''} (National Land Cover Dataset), age, race, income,
   education, living alone, and housing age (U.S. Census).
   Results: In models including multiple effect modifiers, the odds of
   cardiovascular mortality during EH (99th percentile threshold) vs.
   non-EH were higher among non-married individuals (1.21, 95\%
   CI=1.14-1.28 vs. 0.98, 95\% CI = 0.90-1.07 among married individuals)
   and individuals in ZIP codes with high (91\%) non-green space (1.17,
   95\% CI = 1.06-1.29 vs. 0.98, 95\% CI = 0.89-1.07 among individuals in
   ZIP codes with low (39\%) non-green space). Results suggested that
   housing age may also be an effect modifier. For the EH-respiratory
   mortality association, the results were inconsistent between temperature
   metrics and percentile thresholds of EH but largely insignificant.
   Conclusions: Green space, housing and social isolation may independently
   enhance elderly peoples' heat-related cardiovascular mortality

Abstract = {{Local adaptation is a central feature of most species occupying
   spatially heterogeneous environments, and may factor critically in
   responses to environmental change. However, most efforts to model the
   response of species to climate change ignore intraspecific variation due
   to local adaptation. Here, we present a new perspective on spatial
   modelling of organism-environment relationships that combines genomic
   data and community-level modelling to develop scenarios regarding the
   geographic distribution of genomic variation in response to
   environmental change. Rather than modelling species within communities,
   we use these techniques to model large numbers of loci across genomes.
   Using balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) as a case study, we
   demonstrate how our framework can accommodate nonlinear responses of
   loci to environmental gradients. We identify a threshold response to
   temperature in the circadian clock gene GIGANTEA-5 (GI5), suggesting
   that this gene has experienced strong local adaptation to temperature.
   We also demonstrate how these methods can map ecological adaptation from
   genomic data, including the identification of predicted differences in
   the genetic composition of populations under current and future
   climates. Community-level modelling of genomic variation represents an
   important advance in landscape genomics and spatial modelling of
   biodiversity that moves beyond species-level assessments of climate

   carried out to determine the key climatic variables driving ecological
   change in the region. Then, regression models were tested to correlate
   NDVI with the selected climatic variables to determine their predictive
   power. Finally, Sen's slope method was used to determine how terrestrial
   vegetation has responded to regional climate change in the region. The
   results indicated an average winter season NDVI value of 0.14 in the ETP

   vegetation growth has generally been enhanced since 1981; spring NDVI
   increased by 0.03 every 10 years in the ETP and 0.02 in the SLP.
   Further, results from trend analyses suggest vegetation growth in the
   ETP shifted to earlier-start and earlier-end dates, however in the SLP,
   the growing season has been extended with an earlier-start and later-end

   volumetric spore traps and corresponding optical identification at the
   genus level by microscope. The measurements at both sites (including

   Statistically significant higher spore concentrations for Alternaria,
   Cladosporium and Ganoderma were monitored at the Worcester site. This
   result was most likely due to the differences in precipitation and local
   fungal spore sources at the two sites. Alternaria and Cladosporium
   reached their maxima a month earlier in Cork than in Worcester, and
   Didymella with Ganoderma peaked simultaneously with similar diurnal
   trends found for all the investigated spore types. MRT analysis helped
   to determine threshold values of the meteorological parameters that
   exerted most influence on the presence of spores: they were found to
   vary at the two sites. Our results suggest that the aeromycological
   profile is quite uniform over the British Isles, but a description of
   bioaerosols with respect to overall load and daily concentration can be
   quite diverse although the geographical difference between sites is
   relatively small. These variations in the concentrations therefore need
   to be explored at the national level.}},

Abstract = {{1. Recent studies have demonstrated a need for increased rigour in
   building and evaluating ecological niche models (ENMs) based on
   presence-only occurrence data. Two major goals are to balance
   goodness-of-fit with model complexity (e.g. by tuning' model settings)
   and to evaluate models with spatially independent data. These issues are
   especially critical for data sets suffering from sampling bias, and for
   studies that require transferring models across space or time (e.g.
   responses to climate change or spread of invasive species). Efficient
   implementation of procedures to accomplish these goals, however,
   requires automation. We developed ENMeval, an R package that: (i)
   creates data sets for k-fold cross-validation using one of several
   methods for partitioning occurrence data (including options for
   spatially independent partitions), (ii) builds a series of candidate
   models using Maxent with a variety of user-defined settings and (iii)
   provides multiple evaluation metrics to aid in selecting optimal model
   settings. The six methods for partitioning data are n-1 jackknife,
   random k-folds ( = bins), user-specified folds and three methods of
   masked geographically structured folds. ENMeval quantifies six
   evaluation metrics: the area under the curve of the receiver-operating
   characteristic plot for test localities (AUC(TEST)), the difference
   between training and testing AUC (AUC(DIFF)), two different
   threshold-based omission rates for test localities and the Akaike
   information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc). We
   demonstrate ENMeval by tuning model settings for eight tree species of
   the genus Coccoloba in Puerto Rico based on AICc. Evaluation metrics
   varied substantially across model settings, and models selected with
   AICc differed from default ones. In summary, ENMeval facilitates the
   production of better ENMs and should promote future methodological
   research on many outstanding issues.}},

Title = {{A quantitative framework for analysis of regime shifts in a Galapagos

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Regime shifts are often used to describe sharp changes between two or
   more ecological states, each characterized by their own dynamics,
   stochastic fluctuations, or cycles. Ecological theory indicates they can
   occur either as a result of an abrupt environmental forcing (extrinsic
   regime shift), or be indicative of complex responses to local-scale
   dynamics and thresholds (intrinsic regime shift). One important area of
   ecological research is to develop quantitative tools to analyze regime
   shifts, but there are few studies that have applied these methods to the
   long-term ecological record. In this study, we introduce a framework to
   investigate regime shifts in diatom assemblages and mangrove ecosystem
   dynamics in a coastal lagoon from the Galapagos Islands over the past
   2600 years. The framework integrates a set of established statistical
   methodologies for investigating regime shift dynamics in long-term
   ecological records. We use these methods to (1) identify the presence of
   regime shifts; (2) test for a series of hypothetical relationships
   (i.e., linear through to threshold) between ecological response and
   environment using nonlinear regression; and (3) investigate the relative
   importance of intrinsic and extrinsic dynamics in response to
   environmental perturbations. The transitions in the diatoms closely
   track the sequence of disturbance, recovery, and habitat shifts that
   have occurred in the lagoon over the past 2600 years, demonstrating
   extrinsic responses to environmental forcing. In contrast, the shift
   from a mangrove-to a microbial mat-dominated system; 945 cal yr BP
   provides potential evidence of an intrinsic regime shift. Our framework
   enables robust interpretations into the underlying dynamics of regime
   shifts in the paleoecological record and is widely applicable for
   investigating abrupt ecological changes in a range of systems.}},

Abstract = {{Accounting for differences in abundances among species remains a high
   priority for community ecology. While there has been more than 80 years
   of work on trying to explain the characteristic S shape of
   rank-abundance distributions (RADs), there has been recent conjecture
   that the form may not depend on ecological processes per se but may be a
   general phenomenon arising in many unrelated disciplines. We show that
   the RAD shape can be influenced by an ecological process, namely,
   interference competition. The noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) is a
   hyperaggressive, `despotic' bird that occurs over much of eastern
   Australia (> 10(6) km(2)). We compiled data for bird communities from
   350 locations within its range, which were collected using standard
   avian survey methods. We used hierarchical Bayesian models to show that
   the RAD shape was much altered when the abundance of the strong
   interactor exceeded a threshold density; RADs consistently were steeper
   when the density of the noisy miner a parts per thousand yen2.5 birds
   ha(-1). The structure of bird communities at sites where the noisy miner
   exceeded this density was very different from that at sites where the
   densities fell below the threshold: species richness and Shannon
   diversity were much reduced, but mean abundances and mean avian biomass
   per site did not differ substantially.}},

Abstract = {{Odontocetes (toothed whales) are considered sentinel species in the
   marine environment because of their high trophic position, long life
   spans, and blubber that accumulates lipophilic contaminants. Cytochrome
   P4501A1 (CYP1A1) is a biomarker of exposure and molecular effects of
   certain persistent organic pollutants. Immunohistochemistry was used to
   visualize CYP1A1 expression in blubber biopsies collected by non-lethal
   sampling methods from 10 species of free-ranging Hawaiian odontocetes:
   short-finned pilot whale, melon-headed whale, pygmy killer whale, common
   bottlenose dolphin, rough-toothed dolphin, pantropical spotted dolphin,
   Blainville's beaked whale, Cuvier's beaked whale, sperm whale, and
   endangered main Hawaiian Islands insular false killer whale.
   Significantly higher levels of CYP1A1 were observed in false killer
   whales and rough-toothed dolphins compared to melon-headed whales, and
   in general, trophic position appears to influence CYP1A1 expression
   patterns in particular species groups. No significant differences in
   CYP1A1 were found based on age class or sex across all samples. However,
   within male false killer whales, juveniles expressed significantly
   higher levels of CYP1A1 when compared to adults. Total polychlorinated
   biphenyl (aPCBs) concentrations in 84 \% of false killer whales exceeded
   proposed threshold levels for health effects, and aPCBs correlated with
   CYP1A1 expression. There was no significant relationship between PCB
   toxic equivalent quotient and CYP1A1 expression, suggesting that this
   response may be influenced by agonists other than the dioxin-like PCBs
   measured in this study. No significant differences were found for CYP1A1
   expression among social clusters of false killer whales. This work
   provides a foundation for future health monitoring of the endangered
   stock of false killer whales and other Hawaiian odontocetes.}},

Title = {{Improving odour assessment in LCA-the odour footprint}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Odour is an important aspect of systems for human and agricultural waste
   management and many technologies are developed with the sole purpose of
   reducing odour. Compared with greenhouse gas assessment and the
   assessment of toxicity, odour assessment has received little attention
   in the life cycle assessment (LCA) community. This article aims to
   redress this.
   Firstly, a framework for the assessment of odour impacts in LCA was
   developed considering the classical LCA framework of emissions, midpoint
   and endpoint indicators. This suggested that an odour footprint midpoint
   indicator was worth striving for. An approach to calculating an areal
   indicator we call ``odour footprint{''}, which considers the odour
   detection threshold, the diffusion rate and the kinetics of degradation
   of odourants, was implemented in MATLAB. We demonstrated the use of the
   characterisation factors we calculated in a case study based on odour
   removal technology applied to a pig barn.
   We produced a list of 33 linear characterisation factors based on
   hydrogen sulphide equivalents, analogous to the linear carbon dioxide
   equivalency factors in use in carbon footprinting, or the
   dichlorobenzene equivalency factors developed for assessment of toxic
   impacts in LCA. Like the latter, this odour footprint method does not
   take local populations and exposure pathway analysis into account-its
   intent is not to assess regulatory compliance or detailed design. The
   case study showed that despite the need for materials and energy, large
   factor reductions in odour footprint and eutrophication potential were
   achieved at the cost of a smaller factor increase in greenhouse
   emissions.
   The odour footprint method is proposed as an improvement on the
   established midpoint method for odour assessment in LCA. Unlike it, the
   method presented here considers the persistence of odourants. Over time,
   we hope to increase the number of characterised odourants, enabling
   analysts to perform simple site-generic LCA on systems with odourant
   emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Economic development and rising consumption increase pressure on the
   environment. Sustainable production and consumption face the challenge
   of mitigating impacts under uncertainty in economic growth, trade, raw
   material availability and prices, variable consumer behavior and
   technological innovation. Necessary and sufficient conditions and a
   minimum rate policy for environmental enhancement under uncertainty are
   presented. They take into account variability in sales/consumption, in
   net product and material trade and in manufacturing technology and
   associated impacts. Three main criteria are considered. 1(1: reduced
   final wastes. 1(2: reduced extraction of virgin raw materials. K3:
   reduced impacts from manufacturing. The conditions are expressed in
   terms of the cycle rate, which is the generalization of the recycle rate
   and of readily monitored product flows, e.g. overall sales. Key
   advantages of the method are discussed. (A): simplicity and flexibility
   to simulate different growth conditions. (B): a readily determined,
   standardized rate policy, leading to reduced impacts in K1, K2 and K3.
   It is quantitatively established that for lower wastes, uncertainty in
   growth compels increase of the cycle rate larger than a threshold
   related to sales. For lower virgin material extraction, the threshold
   includes net product/material trade as well. Reduction of manufacturing
   impacts requires intensification of cleaner processes with adequately
   lower marginal impacts. In periods of economic austerity, the policy may
   be relaxed: enhancement is achieved via lower rate targets. It is
   concluded that cleaner production becomes all the more important as
   reuse/recycle flows increase and that such innovation may avert
   environmental degradation from manufacturing, even under significant
   growth. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological thresholds, associated with abrupt changes in the state and

   Adaptive response to such changes, and planning for their occurrence,
   requires an understanding of the underlying drivers and system responses

   modelling can advance our ability to anticipate or deal with such major
   ecosystem shifts. Here, we used an existing multi species model with
   smooth continuous functions that were modified to include thresholds
   representing 3 alternative scenarios of predator responses when prey
   numbers drop below a critical threshold: (I) no threshold-like response;
   (II) an abrupt decrease in breeding success by 90\%, and (III) an abrupt
   halving of adult survival. Second, we analysed field observations from 3
   independent marine case studies (abalone, starfish, penguins) for
   evidence of abrupt non-linear responses of predators to changes in
   abundance of principal prey. Third, we compared the model output with
   empirical results and tested (using both a statistical method and by
   fitting multispecies models) the 3 alternative response scenarios. With
   this approach, we found evidence for nonlinear changes in population
   parameters (such as survival rate) of predators as prey numbers declined
   below critical thresholds. As an example of the potential for this
   approach to inform management, we found that abundances of a range of
   marine predators become more variable as prey numbers decline, which may
   be a useful indicator that a system is approaching a tipping point.}},

   allowing the calculation of these typical threshold values (TTVs) was
   applied across a region of highly complex geology (Northern Ireland) to
   six elements of interest; arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, nickel and
   vanadium. Three methods for identifying domains (areas where a readily
   identifiable factor can be shown to control the concentration of an
   element) were used: k-means cluster analysis, boxplots and empirical
   cumulative distribution functions (ECDF). The ECDF method was most
   efficient at determining areas of both elevated and reduced
   concentrations and was used to identify domains in this investigation.
   Two statistical methods for calculating normal background concentrations
   (NBCs) and upper limits of geochemical baseline variation (ULBLs),
   currently used in conjunction with legislative regimes in the UK and
   Finland respectively, were applied within each domain. The NBC
   methodology was constructed to run within a specific legislative
   framework, and its use on this soil geochemical data set was influenced
   by the presence of skewed distributions and outliers. In contrast, the
   ULBL methodology was found to calculate more appropriate TTVs that were
   generally more conservative than the NBCs. TTVs indicate what a
   ``typical{''} concentration of an element would be within a defined
   geographical area and should be considered alongside the risk that each
   of the elements pose in these areas to determine potential risk to

Abstract = {{Precipitation extremes could cause a series of social, environmental and

   largest inland river basin in China, as the study area, focused on the
   frequency analysis of precipitation extremes based on the historical
   daily precipitation records (1960-2010) at nine stations. Generalized
   Pareto distribution (GPD) was employed for fitting the peaks over
   threshold (POT) series, in which Hill plot, percentile method and the
   average annual occurrence number were used to select the threshold in
   GPD. Maximum likelihood estimate and L-moment were used to estimate the
   parameters. The inherent assumptions for POT series were investigated by
   auto-correlation coefficient, Mann-Kendall test, Spearman's rho test,
   cumulative deviation test and Worsley likelihood ratio test. 10, 20, 50
   and 100 year precipitation extremes for Heihe River basin were
   calculated and analyzed as well. It was found the POT series derived
   from several methods involved were approximately independent and
   stationary, and GPD could give a satisfactory fit to the POT series for
   each station. For the upper and lower reaches, the frequency of
   precipitation extremes at long return periods (20, 50 year or longer)
   presented increasing in recent years, and the intensity of the highest
   precipitation were getting stronger as well. The intensity of the
   highest precipitation extremes for the lower reach (21 and 35 \%)
   increased higher than those for the upper reach (10 and 11 \%). For the
   middle reach, the frequency of precipitation extremes (over 20 year
   return level) was not found to be increased. The uneven spatial and
   temporal distribution of precipitation extremes for the basin especially
   for the upper and lower reaches were getting more and more serious,
   which would bring great challenges for the local water allocation and

   groundwater and rain to both rivers and lakes. While these changes are
   expected to have implications for alpine aquatic ecosystems, little is
   known about potential ecological tipping points and associated indicator
   taxa. We examined changes in biotic communities along a gradient of
   glacier influence for two study systems: (1) a stream network in the
   French Pyrenees; and (2) a network of lakes in the Italian Alps, with
   the aim of identifying potential indicator taxa (macroinvertebrates and
   zooplankton) of glacier retreat in these environments. To assess
   parallels in biotic responses across streams and lakes, both primary
   data and findings from other publications were synthesised. Using TITAN
   (Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis) changes in community composition of
   river taxa were identified at thresholds of <5.1\% glacier cover and
   <66.6\% meltwater contribution. Below these thresholds the loss of cold
   stenothermic benthic invertebrate taxa, Diamesa spp. and the Pyrenean
   endemic Rhyacophila angelieri was apparent. Some generalist taxa
   including Protonemura sp., Perla grandis, Baetis alpinus, Rhithrogena
   loyolaea and Microspectra sp. increased when glacier cover was <2.7\%
   and <52\% meltwater. Patterns were not as distinct for the alpine lakes,
   due to fewer sampling sites; however, Daphnia longispina grp. and the
   benthic invertebrate groups Plectopera and Planaria were identified as
   potential indicator taxa. While further work is required to assess
   potential indicator taxa for alpine lake systems, findings from alpine
   river systems were consistent between methods for assessing glacier
   influence (meltwater contribution/glacier cover). Hence, it is clear
   that TITAN could become a useful management tool, enabling: (i) the
   identification of taxa particularly sensitive to glacier retreat; and
   (ii) conservation efforts/resources to be better directed in alpine
   aquatic systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Short-rotation plantations are extending worldwide due to the increased
   demand for pulp and wood. Reliable estimations of recent expansion of
   short-rotation plantation areas and associated land use changes are a
   prerequisite to assess their environmental impact on regional carbon and
   water cycles, and on climate. A binary classification methodology using
   MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day 250 m NDVI
   time series was developed and applied to classify Eucalyptus plantations
   across Brazil. The identification of Eucalyptus plantations specific
   patterns in the time series was based on the calculation of matching
   functions between the NDVI time series and a -2 years long reference
   time series. Among the seven tested matching functions, the bounding
   envelope was the most successful. This method was robust to residual
   noise on the NDVI time series, and a threshold coefficient for the
   binary classification was adjusted using an omission-commission
   criteria. With this method, it was possible to detect any presence of
   Eucalyptus between 2003 and 2009 at monthly time-steps, including the
   periods of bare soils between two rotations that are typically 6-7 years
   long. The dates of first afforestation, of clear-cut at the end of a
   rotation, and of re-planting at the beginning of a new rotation were
   retrieved from the NDVI time series with a precision of -66 days. The
   final almost continuous tri-dimensional map (space and time) was
   validated with three different datasets, from local to regional data.
   All three datasets gave similarly high global accuracy statistics, but a
   global underestimation of Eucalyptus areas compared to large scales
   census was observed. Discrepancies and way to improve the Eucalyptus
   area estimates were discussed in this study. The developed methodology
   could be applied to other short-rotation tree plantations. (C) 2014

Title = {{Rainfall conditions and rainwater harvesting potential in the urban area
   of Khartoumle}},
Journal = {{RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{89-99}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Runoff water management is among the inherent challenges which face the
   sustainability of the development of arid urban centers. These areas are
   particularly at risk from flooding due to rainfall concentration in few
   heavy showers. On the other hand, they are susceptible to drought. The
   capital of Sudan (Khartoum) stands as exemplary for these issues. Hence,
   this research study aims at investigating the potential of applying
   rainwater harvesting (RWH) in Khartoum City Center as a potential urban
   runoff management tool. Rapid urbanization coupled with the extension of
   impervious surfaces has intensified the heat island in Khartoum.
   Consequently, increased frequency of heat waves and dust storms during
   the dry summer and streets flooding during the rainy season have led to
   environmental, economical, and health problems. The study starts with
   exposing the rainfall behavior in Khartoum by investigating rainfall
   variability, number of raindays, distribution of rain over the season,
   probability of daily rainfall, maximum daily rainfall and
   deficit/surplus of rain through time. The daily rainfall data show that
   very strong falls of >30 mm occur almost once every wet season.
   Decreased intra- and inter-annual rainfall surpluses as well as
   increased rainfall concentration in the month of August have been taking
   place. The 30-year rainfall variability is calculated at decade interval
   since 1941. Increasing variability is revealed with 1981-2010 having
   coefficients of variation of 66.6\% for the annual values and
   108.8-118.0\% for the wettest months (July-September). Under the
   aforementioned rainfall conditions, this paper then explores the
   potential of RWH in Khartoum City Center as an option for storm water
   management since the drainage system covers only 40\% of the study area.
   The potential runoff from the 6.5 km(2) center area is computed using
   the United States Natural Resources Conservation Services method
   (US-NRCS), where a weighted Curve Number (CN) of 94\% is found,
   confirming dominant imperviousness. Rainfall threshold for runoff
   generation is found to be 3.3 mm. A 24,000 m(3) runoff generated from a
   13.1 mm rainfall (with 80\% probability and one year return period)
   equals the drainage system capacity. An extreme rainfall of 30 mm
   produces a runoff equivalent to fourfold the drainage capacity. It is
   suggested that the former and latter volumes mentioned above could be
   harvested by applying the rational method from 18\% and 80\% rooftops of
   the commercial and business district area, respectively. Based on the
   above results, six potential sites can be chosen for RWH with a total
   roof catchment area of 39,558 m(2) and potential rooftop RWH per unit
   area of 0.033 m(3). These results reflect the RWH potential for
   effective urban runoff management and better water resources
   utilization. RWH would provide an alternative source of water to tackle
   the drought phenomenon. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Species invasions have a range of negative effects on recipient
   ecosystems, and many occur at a scale and magnitude that preclude
   complete eradication. When complete extirpation is unlikely with
   available management resources, an effective strategy may be to suppress
   invasive populations below levels predicted to cause undesirable
   ecological change. We illustrated this approach by developing and
   testing targets for the control of invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish
   (Pterois volitans and P. miles) on Western Atlantic coral reefs. We
   first developed a size-structured simulation model of predation by
   lionfish on native fish communities, which we used to predict threshold
   densities of lionfish beyond which native fish biomass should decline.
   We then tested our predictions by experimentally manipulating lionfish
   densities above or below reef-specific thresholds, and monitoring the
   consequences for native fish populations on 24 Bahamian patch reefs over
   18 months. We found that reducing lionfish below predicted threshold
   densities effectively protected native fish community biomass from
   predation-induced declines. Reductions in density of 25-92\%, depending
   on the reef, were required to suppress lionfish below levels predicted
   to overconsume prey. On reefs where lionfish were kept below threshold
   densities, native prey fish biomass increased by 50-70\%. Gains in small
   (<6 cm) size classes of native fishes translated into lagged increases
   in larger size classes over time. The biomass of larger individuals (>15
   cm total length), including ecologically important grazers and
   economically important fisheries species, had increased by 10-65\% by
   the end of the experiment. Crucially, similar gains in prey fish biomass
   were realized on reefs subjected to partial and full removal of
   lionfish, but partial removals took 30\% less time to implement. By
   contrast, the biomass of small native fishes declined by >50\% on all
   reefs with lionfish densities exceeding reef-specific thresholds. Large
   inter-reef variation in the biomass of prey fishes at the outset of the
   study, which influences the threshold density of lionfish, means that we
   could not identify a single rule of thumb for guiding control efforts.
   However, our model provides a method for setting reef-specific targets
   for population control using local monitoring data. Our work is the
   first to demonstrate that for ongoing invasions, suppressing invaders
   below densities that cause environmental harm can have a similar effect,
   in terms of protecting the native ecosystem on a local scale, to
   achieving complete eradication.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Bark thickness-stem diameter relationships are non-linear above a
   stem diameter threshold in many woody species, which makes relative bark
   thickness measures dependent on the range of stem diameters that are
   sampled. This influences the appropriateness of different methods for
   comparing fire responses of woody plants across studies. Here we develop
   a framework for bark thickness comparisons by evaluating relative bark
   thickness estimates and bark thickness predictions obtained from linear
   and curved models fitted to raw and log-transformed bark-stem data. We
   use this framework to contrast bark thickness among fynbos and savanna
   plant functional groups.
   Location: Fynbos (17 species) and savanna (21 species) systems in South
   Africa.
   Methods: The linear subset of bark-stem data was identified using a
   three-step procedure. Linear regressions (with and without an intercept)
   and curved models (allometric and modified exponential models) were
   fitted to the linear subset and complete raw bark-stem data set,
   respectively. In addition, linear regression models were fitted to the
   log-transformed complete bark-stem data set. Regression slopes and bark
   thickness predictions obtained from these different approaches were
   compared, to determine which method provides the most robust metric for
   comparing bark thickness. Bark thickness was compared among fynbos
   resprouter guilds and acacias from low- and high-fire savannas.
   Results: The slope of the regression model fitted to the linear subset
   of raw bark-stem data provides a reliable metric for general comparisons
   of relative bark thickness. Bark thickness predictions from the curved
   and log models were comparable at 20-cm stem diameter, but the log model
   underestimated bark thickness at 5 cm for certain species. Relative bark
   thickness was significantly higher in: (1) fynbos fire resisters and
   epicormic resprouters than in non-resprouters; and (2) acacias from
   high- vs low-fire savannas.
   Conclusions: The slope of the regression model fitted to the linear
   subset of raw bark-stem data is a useful metric for bark thickness
   comparisons across studies, and compares favourably with bark thickness
   predictions derived from models fitted to the complete bark-stem data
   set. Fynbos and savanna trends support the proposition that relative
   bark thickness reflects differences in woody plant responses to fire and
   indicate the modal fire regime of ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced sulfur compounds (RSCs) emissions from concentrated animal
   feeding operations (CAFOs) have become a potential environmental and
   human health concern, as a result of changes in livestock production
   methods. RSC emissions were determined from a swine CAFO in North
   Carolina. RSC measurements were made over a period of approximate to 1
   week from both the barn and lagoon during each of the four seasonal
   periods from June 2007 to April 2008. During sampling, meteorological
   and other environmental parameters were measured continuously. Seasonal
   hydrogen sulfide (H2S) barn concentrations ranged from 72 to 631 ppb.
   Seasonal dimethyl sulfide (DMS; CH3SCH3) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS;
   CH3S2CH3) concentrations were 2-3 orders of magnitude lower, ranging
   from 0.18 to 0.89 ppb and 0.47 to 1.02 ppb, respectively. The overall
   average barn emission rate was 3.3 g day(-1) AU(-1) (AU (animal unit) =
   500 kg of live animal weight) for H2S, which was approximately two
   orders of magnitude higher than the DMS and DMDS overall average
   emissions rates, determined as 0.017 g day(-1) AU(-1) and 0.036 g
   day(-1) AU(-1), respectively. The overall average lagoon flux was 1.33
   mu g m(-2) min(-1) for H2S, which was approximately an order of
   magnitude higher than the overall average DMS (0.12 mu g m(-2) min(-1))
   and DMDS (0.09 mu g m(-2) min(-1)) lagoon fluxes. The overall average
   lagoon emission for H2S (0.038 g day(-1) AU(-1)) was also approximately
   an order of magnitude higher than the overall average DMS (0.0034 g
   day(-1) AU(-1)) and DMDS (0.0028 g day(-1) AU(-1)) emissions. H2S, DMS
   and DMDS have offensive odors and low odor thresholds. Over all four
   sampling seasons, 77\% of 15 min averaged H2S barn concentrations were
   an order of magnitude above the average odor threshold. During these
   sampling periods, however, DMS and DMDS concentrations did not exceed
   their odor thresholds. The overall average barn and lagoon emissions
   from this study were used to help estimate barn, lagoon and total (barn
   + lagoon) RSC emissions from swine CAFOs in North Carolina. Total (barn
   + lagoon) H2S emissions from swine CAFOs in North Carolina were
   estimated to be 1.22{*}10(6) kg yr(-1). The barns had significantly
   higher H2S emissions than the lagoons, contributing approximate to 98\%
   of total North Carolina H2S swine CAFO emissions. Total (barn + lagoon)
   emissions for DMS and DMDS were 1-2 orders of magnitude lower, with
   barns contributing approximate to 86\% and approximate to 93\% of total
   emissions, respectively. H2S swine CAFO emissions were estimated to
   contribute approximate to 18\% of North Carolina H2S emissions. (C) 2014

   located at Philippsburg, Neckarwestheim and the disused Obrigheim, those
   in foreign locations close to the border area, i.e. Fessenheim in
   France, and Leibstadt and Beznau in Switzerland, are monitored. The KFUe
   system provides several methods to evaluate and present the measured
   data as well as to ensure compliance of threshold limits and safety
   objectives. For the UM, it serves as an instrument of the nuclear
   supervision. In case of a radioactive release, the authorities
   responsible for civil protection can use dispersion calculations in
   order to identify potentially affected areas and to initiate protective
   measures for the population. Beyond the data collected at the plant
   sites, various international radiation and meteorological measuring

Abstract = {{Social well-being and social justice are meant to create a positive

   of social justice to ensure a fair and ethic society. However, even if a
   lot of studies focused on the definition social indicators to assess
   resulting impacts, neither have scientific or common agreements been
   founded to define a valid set of indicators, nor have consistent
   pathways from inventory towards impact indicators been established. This

   ranges/fractions: F1 (C6-C10), F2 (C10-C16), F3 (C16-C34), and F4
   (>C34). The methods and guidelines were developed and validated for
   soils with approximately 5\% total organic carbon (TOC). However,
   organic soils have much higher TOC levels because of biogenic organic
   compounds (BOCs) originating from sources such as plant waxes and fatty
   acids. Coextracted BOCs can have elevated F2-F4 concentrations, which
   can cause false exceedances of PHC soil guidelines. The present study
   evaluated false PHC detections in soil samples collected from 34
   background sites. The list of analytes included soil type, TOC,
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), F2, F3, F4, F3a (C16-C22), and
   F3b (C22-C34). Soils with 3\% to 41\% TOC falsely exceeded the CWS PHC
   300 mg/kg F3 coarse soil guideline. It was previously demonstrated that
   clean peat had F2: F3b ratios of less than 0.10, while crude oil spiked
   peat and spiked sand had higher ratios of greater than 0.10. In the
   present background study, all of the clean organic soils with at least
   300 mg/kg F3 had F2: F3b ratios of less than 0.10, which indicated false
   guideline exceedances. Clean inorganic soils had low F3 concentrations,
   resulting in high F2: F3b ratios of greater than 0.10. Validation field
   studies are required to determine if the F2: F3b 0.10 PHC presence
   versus absence threshold value is applicable to crude oil-and
   diesel-contaminated sites. (C) 2014 SETAC}},

Abstract = {{Background: Effects of prenatal Manganese (Mn) exposure at an
   environmental relevant level on neonatal neurodevelopment remains
   unclear.
   Objectives: In the multi-center study, we assessed the impact of low
   level prenatal Mn exposure on neonatal behavioral neurological
   assessments (NBNA), and explore a threshold umbilical cord blood Mn on
   neonatal neurological development.
   Methods: We investigated 933 mother-newborn pairs in Shanghai, China,
   from 2008 through 2009. Umbilical cord serum concentrations of Mn were
   measured and NBNA tests were conducted. The NBNA contains five clusters:
   behavior, active tone, passive tone, primary reflexes and general
   assessment with a maximal total score of 40. The score <37 is defined as
   low.
   Results: The median serum Mn concentration was 4.0 mu g/L. Of the 933
   infants, 44 (4.7\%) had low NBNA. After adjusting for potential
   confounders, a high level of Mn (>= 75th percentile) was associated with
   a lower NBNA score (adjusted beta = -1.1, 95\% CI: -1.4-0.7, p <0.01)
   and a higher risk of low NBNA (adjusted OR=9A, 95\% CI: 3.4-25.7, p
   <0.01). A nonlinear relationship was observed between cord serum Mn and
   NBNA after adjusting for potential confounders. NBNA score decreased
   with increasing Mn levels after 5.0 mu g/L(LgMn >= 0.7). The cord serum
   Mn >= 5.0 mu g/L had adverse effects on behavior, active tone and
   general reactions of clusters (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: High prenatal Mn exposure even at an environmental relevant
   level, is associated with poor fetal neurobehavioral development in a
   nonlinear pattern. A threshold cord serum Mn of 5.0 mu g/L existed for
   lower neonatal behavioral neurological assessments. (C) 2014 Published

Abstract = {{Aim Southern temperate tree lines are found at low elevations compared
   with their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. They are also regarded as
   forming at warm temperatures, which has been attributed to
   taxon-specific limitations. Using New Zealand tree lines as an example,
   we assess whether these tree lines are anomalously warm compared with
   the global mean.
   Location New Zealand.
   Methods Soil and air temperatures were measured over 2 years at six New
   Zealand tree line sites, and compared with other local and global
   growing season temperature data. In New Zealand and other oceanic
   regions, the long, variable seasonal transitions make calculations of
   mean growing season temperatures highly sensitive to how the growing
   season is defined. We used both the conventional (wide) definition (from
   when mean weekly root-zone temperature exceeds 3.2 degrees C in spring,
   to when it first falls below 3.2 degrees C in autumn) and a narrow
   definition (the period during which temperatures are continuously above
   3.2 C). Application of these criteria leads to similar mean growing
   season temperatures in continental regions, but different ones in
   oceanic regions. We tested whether growing season temperatures differ
   between northern and southern temperate tree lines.
   Results New Zealand tree lines had a mean root-zone temperature during
   the wide growing season of 7.0 degrees C +/- 0.4 SD, not significantly
   different from those at northern temperate tree lines. The mean
   temperature of the narrow growing season was 7.8 degrees C, warmer than
   tree lines elsewhere, but still within the range reported for temperate
   tree lines (7-8 degrees C).
   Main conclusions Whilst they are found at lower elevations, New Zealand
   tree lines form at temperatures similar to those at Northern Hemisphere
   temperate tree lines. Together with similar recent evidence from Chile,
   these results refute the previously postulated taxon-specific limitation
   hypothesis, and suggest these southern temperate tree lines are not
   climatically depressed, but are governed by the same thermal threshold
   as other tree lines worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{The hepatotoxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is produced by freshwater
   cyanobacteria becoming an emerging threat for human health. Methods for
   the rapid determination of CYN in environmental samples are needed.
   Conventional analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC/MS) and thermally-assisted
   hydrolysis and methylation (TCh-GC/MS) were used to study a CYN
   standard, two Aphanizomenon ovalisporum cultures (CYN+) and one culture
   of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (CYN-). A micro-furnace pyrolyzer was
   used directly attached to a GC/MS system fitted with a 30 m x 250 mu m x
   0.25 mu m film thickness column (14\% cyanopropyl phenyl, 86\% dimethyl
   polysiloxane pahase composition). Oven temperature was held at 50
   degrees C for 1 min and increased to 100 degrees C at 30 degrees C
   min(-1), from 100 degrees C to 300 degrees C at 10 degrees C min(-1),
   and stabilized at 300 degrees C for 10 min using helium (1 mL min(-1))
   as carrier gas. Pyrolysis at 500 degrees C yield over 70 compounds with
   20 specific for CYN+ samples. Two peaks containing a diagnostic fragment
   (m/z 194) were found at 25.0 and 28.9 min only in CYN+ samples. Fewer
   peaks with limited diagnostic value were released after TCh-GC/MS,
   including breakdown products and TMAH adducts. A compound was detected
   that may correspond to the CYN molecule (MW 415 Da) thermoevaporation
   product after the loss of SO3 (MW 80 Da). This TCh-GC/MS peak (m/z 336)
   together with the fragments obtained by conventional Py-GC/MS (m/z 194)

Abstract = {{This work applies ecological footprint analysis to establish the

   estimates changes in ecological footprint and biocapacity indicators for
   Taroko National Park (Taiwan) from 2002 to 2011. The findings indicate
   that: (1) In the past 10 years, the biocapacity status of Taroko
   National Park has remained within the environmental capacity; however,
   the per-capita ecological reserve decreased by 73.38 \% between 2002 and
   2011, from 0.085010 global hectares to 0.022633 global hectares.
   Evaluation of the ecological footprint intensity index reveals that the

   the ecological footprint intensity index reaches 0.5-when the ecological

Abstract = {{The change of land use in urban and suburban areas is an on-going
   process. The aim of this paper is to study and statistically model
   landscape patterns changes in the Bratislava region (Slovakia) between
   2002 and 2011. In the study, we perform the classic landscape-ecological
   method of land use mapping, and several spatial analytical tools
   provided by the GIS environment with statistical modeling using obtained
   spatial data. In order to explicitly study the determinants of landscape
   patterns changes between 2002 and 2011, firstly an exploratory principal
   component analysis (PCA) is performed with variables obtained from GIS
   modeling. Secondly, the results from PCA are used in the logistic
   regression model. The landscape patterns changes were defined as
   transition areas in which the change of function has been performed in
   the study time period. The proposed regression model estimates the
   threshold probability of the landscape patterns' changes of transition
   areas under the effect of the adjacent areas. In order to accurately
   capture land use changes, high resolution aerial photographs of the
   Bratislava area including the city and surrounding villages from 2002 to
   2011 were analyzed. The spatial buffers mapping of the transition areas
   in the GIS environment was based on data from ortophotos in the precise
   scale of 1:2000. Key methodology findings are regularities about the
   process of urban dynamics, focused on the change of urban boundaries in
   the urban system contact area. Various behavior rules have been defined
   such as embedded distance, spatial pattern and transition probabilities,
   which are essential in the proposed logistic regression model. In order
   to pragmatically incorporate the regression model as a software model
   tool, it needs to generate effective urban simulations consistent with
   GIS data inputs, outputs and related functionality. This enables
   utilizing the software model, which might be incorporated as a plugin in
   the GIS environment. Both GIS and statistical regression modeling might
   be used as predictive tools in an urban policy decision making, with a
   better understanding of discrete non-linear urban dynamics and to ensure
   the sustainable use of land and the protection of biodiversity in urban
   ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An integral component in the development of media-specific values for
   the ecological risk assessment of chemicals is the derivation of safe
   levels of exposure for wildlife. Although the derivation and subsequent
   application of these values can be used for screening purposes, there is
   a need to identify the threshold for effects when making remedial
   decisions during site-specific assessments. Methods for evaluation of
   wildlife exposure are included in the US Environmental Protection Agency
   (USEPA) ecological soil screening levels (Eco-SSLs), registration,
   evaluation, authorization, and restriction of chemicals (REACH), and
   other risk-based soil assessment approaches. The goal of these
   approaches is to ensure that soil-associated contaminants do not pose a
   risk to wildlife that directly ingest soil, or to species that may be
   exposed to contaminants that persist in the food chain. These approaches
   incorporate broad assumptions in the exposure and effects assessments
   and in the risk characterization process. Consequently, thresholds for
   concluding risk are frequently very low with conclusions of risk
   possible when soil metal concentrations fall in the range of natural
   background. A workshop held in September, 2012 evaluated existing
   methods and explored recent science about factors to consider when
   establishing appropriate remedial goals for concentrations of metals in
   soils. A Foodweb Exposure Workgroup was organized to evaluate methods
   for quantifying exposure of wildlife to soil-associated metals through
   soil and food consumption and to provide recommendations for the
   development of ecological soil cleanup values (Eco-SCVs) that are both
   practical and scientifically defensible. The specific goals of this
   article are to review the current practices for quantifying exposure of
   wildlife to soil-associated contaminants via bioaccumulation and trophic
   transfer, to identify potential opportunities for refining and improving
   these exposure estimates, and finally, to make recommendations for
   application of these improved models to the development of site-specific
   remedial goals protective of wildlife. Although the focus is on metals
   contamination, many of the methods and tools discussed are also
   applicable to organic contaminants. The conclusion of this workgroup was
   that existing exposure estimation models are generally appropriate when
   fully expanded and that methods are generally available to develop more
   robust site-specific exposure estimates. Improved realism in
   site-specific wildlife Eco-SCVs could be achieved by obtaining more
   realistic estimates for diet composition, bioaccumulation,
   bioavailability and/or bioaccessibility, soil ingestion, spatial aspects
   of exposure, and target organ exposure. These components of wildlife
   exposure estimation should be developed on a site-, species-, and
   analyte-specific basis to the extent that the expense for their
   derivation is justified by the value they add to Eco-SCV development.

Abstract = {{Although it is widely recognized that microorganisms are essential for
   sustaining soil fertility, structure, nutrient cycling, groundwater
   purification, and other soil functions, soil microbial toxicity data
   were excluded from the derivation of Ecological Soil Screening Levels
   (Eco-SSL) in the United States. Among the reasons for such exclusion
   were claims that microbial toxicity tests were too difficult to
   interpret because of the high variability of microbial responses,
   uncertainty regarding the relevance of the various endpoints, and
   functional redundancy. Since the release of the first draft of the
   Eco-SSL Guidance document by the US Environmental Protection Agency in
   2003, soil microbial toxicity testing and its use in ecological risk
   assessments have substantially improved. A wide range of standardized
   and nonstandardized methods became available for testing chemical
   toxicity to microbial functions in soil. Regulatory frameworks in the
   European Union and Australia have successfully incorporated microbial
   toxicity data into the derivation of soil threshold concentrations for
   ecological risk assessments. This article provides the 3-part rationale
   for including soil microbial processes in the development of soil
   clean-up values (SCVs): 1) presenting a brief overview of relevant test
   methods for assessing microbial functions in soil, 2) examining data
   sets for Cu, Ni, Zn, and Mo that incorporated soil microbial toxicity
   data into regulatory frameworks, and 3) offering recommendations on how
   to integrate the best available science into the method development for
   deriving site-specific SCVs that account for bioavailability of metals
   and metalloids in soil. Although the primary focus of this article is on
   the development of the approach for deriving SCVs for metals and
   metalloids in the United States, the recommendations provided in this

   developing ecological soil threshold values for protection of microbial

Abstract = {{Remote sensing and landscape ecology concepts can provide a useful
   framework for state-and-transition models (STM) in order to quantify
   thresholds at different scales, and provide useful information for
   scientists, land managers, and conservationists in relation to
   resilience management. The overall aim of this research was to develop a
   spatially explicit STM to quantify thresholds based on the scale of
   disturbance processes impacting a grazing system. Specific objectives
   were to develop a conceptual STM framework for upland grazing
   ecosystems, to quantify spatial dynamics of stable and degraded
   pastures, and to assess threshold occurrence. Color aerial photography
   from Armboth Fell in the English Lake District National Park (United
   Kingdom) was classified into bare rock, dwarf shrub heath (DSH), and
   grassland/degraded wet heath (GDWH) in four pastures with different
   degrees of grazing pressure. Vegetation communities from these pastures
   were combined with soils, climate, and landform data to create a
   conceptual STM framework. Each pasture was sampled with 2-ha plots to
   quantify DSH and GDWH spatial structure. The proposed STM consisted of
   two reference and three alternative states. Low-grazing-pressure areas
   showed significantly higher percentage of DSH cover with larger
   contiguous patches and lower patch density than high-grazing-pressure
   areas. Breakpoints, considered to be thresholds, in mean patch area were
   identified in our data when DSH percentage cover was < 63\% and GDWH, >
   77\%. The present study has shown the value of a robust, reliable, and
   repeatable approach to identify landscape dynamics and integrate it with
   field data to inform a conceptual STM framework for upland grazing
   ecosystems. It also demonstrates the importance of selecting scales
   relevant to the predominant disturbance process to test for threshold
   occurrence, and how this approach can be integrated with current
   assessment methods for resilience management.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To describe the structural and floristic diversity of New
   Caledonian mixed tropical rain forest and investigate its environmental
   determinants.
   Location: New Caledonia (SW Pacific), a biodiversity hotspot.
   Methods: Structural (stem density, basal area) and floristic
   characteristics (composition, species richness and dissimilarity) were
   investigated along environmental gradients (elevation, rainfall and
   slope) on different substrates (ultramafic and non-ultramafic) through
   the New Caledonian Plant Inventory and Permanent Plots Network
   (NC-PIPPN, 201 plots each measuring 20 m x 20 m).
   Results: A total of 28,640 trees (DBH >= 5 cm) belonging to 749 species,
   240 genera and 92 families were inventoried in the NC-PIPPN. The New
   Caledonian mixed rain forest studied was characterized as having high
   stem density, basal area and species richness, and many small stems
   (60\% of the trees <10 cm DBH and almost a quarter of species did not
   exceed this threshold). More than one-third of the species were rare
   (i.e. inventoried in less than three plots or represented by fewer than
   three individuals) in the plot network and floristic dissimilarity was
   high (Bray-Curtis index >0.70). The presence of ultramafic (UM) and
   non-ultramafic substrates (non-UM) combined with altitudinal and
   rainfall gradients were the main drivers of floristic dissimilarity,
   whereas the effect of geographic distance between the plots was
   surprisingly low. Floristic dissimilarity was very high between UM and
   non-UM substrates from species up to family level. About 75\% of the
   species occurred on a single substrate type. The mixed rain forest on UM
   and non-UM substrates differed in floristic composition but not in
   structure.
   Conclusions: NC-PIPPN proved to be an effective tool for investigating
   the woody species richness of New Caledonia as containing ca. 46\% of
   its non-herbaceous species. However, the network's design, and more
   specifically its small plots, restricts its capacity to capture beta
   diversity and forest structure. High species richness and floristic
   dissimilarity confirm that New Caledonian mixed rain forest is

Abstract = {{Questions: How does the response to environmental filters change across
   the life cycle of pioneer plants through the early process of community
   assembly? Is there a threshold at any of the life-history stages during
   roadcut primary colonization?
   Location: A very steep, sun-exposed, low-fertility and low water
   retention roadcut in a Mediterranean continental site in Madrid, central
   Spain.
   Methods: We tracked density of individuals, plant cover, species
   richness and community composition throughout the sequential process of
   primary colonization of a newly-exposed roadcut surface. We monitored
   from seed arrival to seedling emergence, seedling survival and plant
   growth across species over two growing seasons. We manipulated the
   intensity of environmental filters in 12 experimental plots (10 x 8 m)
   following a full-factorial design of two treatments (topsoil spreading
   and shallow tillage).
   Results: The response to environmental filter manipulation varied
   throughout the individual life cycle. Under an equal seed rain, the
   higher carrying capacity caused by topsoil spreading gave rise to the
   emergence of a larger number of species, which either persisted or
   occasionally appeared in some of the stages of the early community
   assembly. Further, topsoil spreading enhanced seedling survival across
   species, as well as subsequent plant growth. We therefore detected two
   life-history stages acting as thresholds in plant community assembly due
   to an ontogenetic niche shift across species. The first, at seedling
   emergence, in response to environmental cues with lasting consequences
   in community composition and species richness; and the second, at the
   transition to the adult stage in response to local resource
   availability, with consequences in subsequent plant growth and community
   cover.
   Conclusions: During primary colonization, ontogenetic development of
   pioneers was paralleled by the action of environmental filters
   throughout the community assembly process. On roadcuts, the confluence
   of both processes gives rise to a community ontogeny marked by two
   thresholds determining community richness and cover under Mediterranean
   conditions. Our findings shed light on the underlying mechanisms
   involved in technical solutions, such as topsoil spreading, and provide
   a more efficient approach to roadside restoration.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Aim Processes and variables measured in ecology are almost always
   spatially autocorrelated, potentially leading to the choice of overly
   complex models when performing variable selection. One way to solve this
   problem is to account for residual spatial autocorrelation (RSA) for
   each subset of variables considered and then use a classical model
   selection criterion such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
   However, this method can be laborious and it raises other concerns such
   as which spatial model to use or how to compare different spatial
   models. To improve the accuracy of variable selection in ecology, this
   study evaluates an alternative method based on a spatial
   cross-validation procedure. Such a procedure is usually used for model
   evaluation but can also provide interesting outcomes for variable
   selection in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Innovation We
   propose to use a special case of spatial cross-validation, spatial
   leave-one-out (SLOO), giving a criterion equivalent to the AIC in the
   absence of spatial autocorrelation. SLOO only computes non-spatial
   models and uses a threshold distance (equal to the range of RSA) to keep
   each point left out spatially independent from the others. We first
   provide some simulations to evaluate how SLOO performs compared with
   AIC. We then assess the robustness of SLOO on a large-scale dataset. R
   software codes are provided for generalized linear models. Main
   conclusions The AIC was relevant for variable selection in the presence
   of RSA if the independent variables considered were not spatially
   autocorrelated. It otherwise failed because highly spatially
   autocorrelated variables were more often selected than others.
   Conversely, SLOO had similar performances whether the variables were
   themselves spatially autocorrelated or not. It was particularly useful
   when the range of RSA was small, which is a common property of spatial
   tools. SLOO appears to be a promising solution for selecting relevant
   variables from most ecological spatial datasets.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses the question of how to change individuals'
   behavior towards more sustainable practices using Information Technology
   (IT). By following a multidisciplinary and socio-technical perspective,
   this inquiry is answered by applying a new framework-The Commonality
   Framework for IT-enabled Change-on a case study of sustainable
   behavioral change. The framework is grounded in practice theory and is
   used to analyze the implementation of an IT-system aimed at changing
   citizens' behavior towards more sustainable transport logistics and
   procurement in Uppsala, Sweden. The article applies case study research
   design and the empirical data consists of surveys, in-depth and
   semi-structured interviews, observations and archival documents. The
   results show how the change towards sustainable practices is an
   entanglement of both social and technical-structural elements across
   time. In this process, structures such as IT are the enablers, and the
   actors and their social activities are the tipping-point factors that
   ultimately determine the success of changing individuals' behavior
   towards a more sustainable direction. This article provides a more
   balanced view of how both actor and structure related properties
   interact during the on-going work with change towards greater
   sustainability practices than earlier research has offered. More
   specifically, the article offers both a lower-level theory and a method
   from which we can analyze change processes where technology is seen in
   its context, and where both technology and the human actor is brought
   forth to center stage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In 2007-2008, a plant growing pot experiment was carried out, in which
   the content of microelements, including heavy metals, in soil material

   urea) as well as their influence on the development of some qualitative
   traits of perennial rye-grass. The results showed that double doses of
   multi-component mineral fertilisers with urea contributed to a higher
   increase in the content of microelements in biomass of perennial
   ryegrass Lolium perenne than their single doses. The highest
   concentrations of cadmium, copper and lead were contained by ryegrass

   11.0\% and 2.81\% more, respectively, than after the application of a
   single dose of SuproFoska 20 or Suprofos 25. The experiment demonstrated
   the highest content of cadmium, copper, manganese and lead in perennial
   ryegrass biomass in the treatments with combined organic (compost) and
   mineral (SuproFoska 20 with urea) fertilisation. However, the nickel and
   zinc content in biomass were the highest in the variant with combined

   Multi-component mineral fertilisers and urea applied in combination with

Abstract = {{Great uncertainty exists around indoor biomass burning exposure-disease

   aerosol characteristics. This paper explores relative humidity (RH) and
   gravimetric equivalency adjustment approaches to be used for the
   pDR-1000 used to assess indoor PM concentrations for a cookstove

   performed equivalently (similar root mean squared error). For
   gravimetric conversion, the new linear regression equation with
   log-transformed variables performed better than the traditional linear
   equation. In addition, gravimetric conversion equations utilizing a
   spline or quadratic term were examined. We propose a humidity adjustment
   equation encompassing the entire RH range instead of adjusting for RH
   above an arbitrary 60\% threshold. Furthermore, we propose new

Abstract = {{Pearson's correlation coefficient (rho) is the most commonly reported
   metric of the success of prediction in genomic selection (GS). However,
   in real breeding r may not be very useful for assessing the quality of
   the regression in the tails of the distribution, where individuals are
   chosen for selection. This research used 14 maize and 16 wheat data sets
   with different trait-environment combinations. Six different models were
   evaluated by means of a cross-validation scheme (50 random partitions
   each, with 90\% of the individuals in the training set and 10\% in the
   testing set). The predictive accuracy of these algorithms for selecting
   individuals belonging to the best a 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40\% of the
   distribution was estimated using Cohen's kappa coefficient (kappa) and
   an ad hoc measure, which we call relative efficiency (RE), which
   indicates the expected genetic gain due to selection when individuals
   are selected based on GS exclusively. We put special emphasis on the
   analysis for alpha=15\%, because it is a percentile commonly used in
   plant breeding programmes (for example, at CIMMYT). We also used r as a
   criterion for overall success. The algorithms used were: Bayesian LASSO
   (BL), Ridge Regression (RR), Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RHKS),
   Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) with
   linear (lin) and Gaussian kernels (rbf). The performance of regression
   methods for selecting the best individuals was compared with that of
   three supervised classification algorithms: Random Forest Classification
   (RFC) and Support Vector Classification (SVC) with linear (lin) and
   Gaussian (rbf) kernels. Classification methods were evaluated using the
   same cross-validation scheme but with the response vector of the
   original training sets dichotomised using a given threshold. For
   alpha=15\%, SVC-lin presented the highest k coefficients in 13 of the 14
   maize data sets, with best values ranging from 0.131 to 0.722
   (statistically significant in 9 data sets) and the best RE in the same
   13 data sets, with values ranging from 0.393 to 0.948 (statistically
   significant in 12 data sets). RR produced the best mean for both k and
   RE in one data set (0.148 and 0.381, respectively). Regarding the wheat
   data sets, SVC-lin presented the best k in 12 of the 16 data sets, with
   outcomes ranging from 0.280 to 0.580 (statistically significant in 4
   data sets) and the best RE in 9 data sets ranging from 0.484 to 0.821
   (statistically significant in 5 data sets). SVC-rbf (0.235), RR (0.265)
   and RHKS (0.422) gave the best k in one data set each, while RHKS and BL
   tied for the last one (0.234). Finally, BL presented the best RE in two
   data sets (0.738 and 0.750), RFR (0.636) and SVC-rbf (0.617) in one and
   RHKS in the remaining three (0.502, 0.458 and 0.586). The difference
   between the performance of SVC-lin and that of the rest of the models
   was not so pronounced at higher percentiles of the distribution. The
   behaviour of regression and classification algorithms varied markedly
   when selection was done at different thresholds, that is, k and RE for
   each algorithm depended strongly on the selection percentile. Based on
   the results, we propose classification method as a promising alternative
   for GS in plant breeding.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of three neighboring soils from the NE of Turkey
   were evaluated in order to elucidate the effect of different land-use
   management on the soil aggregate stability and microbial biomass in
   Galyan-Atasu dam watershed. Three experimental sites corresponding to
   three land uses were selected. The first site is a hazelnut orchard
   (agriculture), the second site is a forest dominated by mature
   coniferous trees, and the third site is grassland. Soil aggregate
   stability values for the 1-2-mm aggregates increased from forest
   (lowest) to agriculture (highest) in the current study. The percentage
   of clay was highest in agriculture soils with 33.57 \%, and overall
   stability values increased according to soil clay content. The lower
   aggregate stability in the forest soils probably reflects the highly
   silty texture soils with 11.95 \% compared to agriculture and grassland.
   However, in our study, there were no significant correlations between
   aggregate stability and organic C concentrations either in cultivated or
   forested soils. Aggregate stability depended more on the organic matter
   content when the organic matter content was greater than 50 or 60 mg
   g(-1). Below that threshold, aggregate stability may be mainly related
   to clay content. Furthermore, the results confirmed that higher
   percentages of Cmic/Corg in agricultural soils are the result of more
   labile organic substrates maintained in the soil, allowing a higher
   microbial biomass C per unit of soil organic C. This work gives a better
   understanding of the relationships between land-use type and soil
   aggregation and allows to know the soil response to different types of

Abstract = {{Current environmental risk assessment (ERA) of chemicals for aquatic
   invertebrates relies on standardized laboratory tests in which toxicity
   effects on individual survival, growth and reproduction are measured.
   Such tests determine the threshold concentration of a chemical below
   which no population-level effects are expected. How well this procedure
   captures effects on individuals and populations, however, remains an
   open question. Here we used mechanistic effect models, combining
   individual-level reproduction and survival models with an
   individual-based population model (IBM), to understand the individuals'
   responses and extrapolate them to the population level. We used a
   toxicant (Dispersogen A) for which adverse effects on laboratory
   populations were detected at the determined threshold concentration and
   thus challenged the conservatism of the current risk assessment method.
   Multiple toxicity effects on reproduction and survival were reported, in
   addition to effects on the F1 generation. We extrapolated commonly
   tested individual toxicity endpoints, reproduction and survival, to the
   population level using the IBM. Effects on reproduction were described
   via regression models. To select the most appropriate survival model,
   the IBM was run assuming either stochastic death (SD) or individual
   tolerance (IT). Simulations were run for different scenarios regarding
   the toxicant's effects: survival toxicity, reproductive toxicity, or
   survival and reproductive toxicity. As population-level endpoints, we
   used population size and structure and extinction risk. We found that
   survival represented as SD explained population dynamics better than IT.
   Integrating toxicity effects on both reproduction and survival yielded
   more accurate predictions of population effects than considering
   isolated effects. To fully capture population effects observed at high
   toxicant concentrations, toxicity effects transmitted to the F1
   generation had to be integrated. Predicted extinction risk was highly
   sensitive to the assumptions about individual-level effects. Our results
   demonstrate that the endpoints used in current standard tests may not be
   sufficient for assessing the risk of adverse effects on populations. A
   combination of laboratory population experiments with mechanistic effect
   models is a powerful tool to better understand and predict effects on
   both individuals and populations. Mechanistic effect modelling thus
   holds great potential to improve the accuracy of ERA of chemicals in the
   future. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{Ship surveillance by remote sensing technology has become a valuable
   tool for protecting marine environments. In recent years, the successful
   launch of advanced synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors that have high
   resolution and multipolarimetric modes has enabled researchers to use
   SAR imagery for not only ship detection but also ship category
   recognition. A hierarchical ship detection and recognition scheme is
   proposed. The complementary information obtained from multipolarimetric
   modes is used to improve both the detection precision and the
   recognition accuracy. In the ship detection stage, a three-class fuzzy
   c-means clustering algorithm is used to calculate the segmenting
   threshold for prescreening ship candidates. To reduce the false alarm
   rate (FAR), we use a two-step discrimination strategy. In the first
   step, we fuse the detection results from multipolarimetric channels to
   reduce the speckle noise, ambiguities, sidelobes, and other sources of
   interference. In the second step, we use a binary classifier, which is
   trained with prior data collected on ships and nonships, to reduce the
   FAR even further. In the ship category recognition stage, we concatenate
   texture-based descriptors extracted from multiple polarmetric channels
   to construct a robust ship representation for category recognition.
   Furthermore, we construct and release a ship category database with real
   SAR data. We hope that it can be used to promote investigations of SAR
   ship recognition in the remote sensing and related academic communities.
   The proposed method is validated by a comprehensive experimental
   comparison to the state-of-the-art methods. The validation procedure
   showed that the proposed method outperforms all of the competing methods
   by about 5\% and 15\% in terms of ship detection and recognition,

Abstract = {{The mining industry is a very rapidly increasing production sector in

   the Finnish Environmental Administration for threshold and guideline
   value determinations in the Finnish PIMA Decree (214/2007) and
   Government Decree (591/2006) concerning recovery of certain wastes in

   and middle-school students on 5-10 occasions from October 2007 to
   November 2009 in New Taipei City, Taiwan. During the week of each lung
   function measurement, continuous daily concentrations of fungal spores
   were measured from Sunday to Saturday. The counts of fungal spores
   belonging to specific taxa were identified. A mixed-effect model with
   repeated measurements was used to analyze the association of lung
   function and exposure to each specific taxon of fungal spores. Forward
   stepwise regression was applied to determine which specific fungal
   spores were the most closely related to lung function changes. The
   non-linear relationship was examined using a generalized additive model.
   The piecewise linear regression was then applied to determine the
   threshold value.
   Results: A total of 824 measurements were obtained from 100
   participants. Among all the species of fungal spores, only Cladosporium
   spores were found to be negatively associated with forced vital capacity
   (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) one day later.
   This association was stronger than the one between the total spore
   counts and lung function. The threshold of exposure where lung function
   effect became observable was approximately 1500 spores/m(3).
   Conclusion: This study showed that ambient Cladosporium was most
   strongly associated with the observed lung function changes among
   schoolchildren. Replication of these preliminary findings in other
   geographic areas with different populations would be warranted. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{No clear definition of sustainable development exists to guide
   politicians in solving challenges at the global or regional levels.
   Rather, the concept's use has increasingly reflected socially desirable
   attributes of solutions to local- and project-level problems, but these
   ignore the global challenges that the concept was meant to address. We
   return to the original definition of sustainable development used in the
   Brundtland Report and suggest an assessment method to determine whether
   countries currently meet the threshold values of four equally important
   primary dimensions: safeguarding long-term ecological sustainability,
   satisfying basic needs, and promoting intragenerational and
   intergenerational equity. We also define indicators and threshold values
   for each of these dimensions; in addition, we show how 167 countries
   compare in meeting these threshold values. Currently, no country meets
   all four thresholds. Even so, we propose that, with the use of
   technology and behavioural changes, it will be possible to reach the
   threshold values by 2030. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The ecological water conveyance project that pipes water from Daxihaizi
   reservoir to lower reaches of Tarim River has been implemented ten times
   since 2000. After ecological water conveyance, restoration has taken
   place for vegetation along the dried-up lower reaches of the Tarim
   River. The changes of vegetation fluctuated yearly due to ecological
   water conveyance. In order to reveal the detailed process of vegetation
   changes, remote sensing images from 1999 to 2010 were all classified
   individually into vegetated and non-vegetated areas using the
   soil-adjusted vegetation index threshold method. Then inter-annual
   changes of vegetation over a period of 12 years were obtained using a
   post-classification change detection technique. Finally,
   spatial-temporal changes distribution of vegetation cover and its
   response to ecological water conveyance were analyzed. The results
   indicate: (1) vegetation area increased by 8.52 \% overall after
   ecological water conveyance. Vegetation between 2003 and 2004 increased
   dramatically with 45.87 \% while vegetation between 2002 and 2003
   decreased dramatically with 17.83 \%. (2) Vegetation area gain is
   greater than vegetation loss during 1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004 and
   2009-2010 periods. Although vegetation restoration is obvious from 1999
   to 2010, vegetation loss also existed except for the periods above. It
   indicates that vegetation restoration fluctuated due to ecological water
   conveyance. (3) Spatial distribution of vegetation restoration presented
   ``strip{''} distribution along the river and group shaper in the lower
   terrain area, while spatial distribution of vegetation loss mainly
   located in the upper reaches of river and area far away from the river.
   (4) Vegetation restoration area had a positive relative with total
   ecological water conveyance volume. The scheme and season of ecological
   water conveyance had also influenced the vegetation restoration. The
   vegetation change process monitoring, based on continuous remote sensing
   data, can provide the spatial-temporal distribution of vegetation cover

Abstract = {{The Zoige alpine wetland on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau is
   an important headwater area for the Yellow River Basin. The White and
   Black Rivers are two major tributaries in the Zoige Basin. However, the
   alpine wetland has experienced a rapid degradation due to human and
   other recent environmental changes in the region. The effects of climate
   variations and human activities on runoff in this region are still
   unclear. In this study, those changes in runoff were quantified and
   categorized using the hydrologic sensitivity analysis method and a
   monthly water balance model. The temperature index-based snow melting
   submodel was integrated into a monthly water balance model to account
   for the considerable snow meltwater from the wetland in the summer
   season. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test was used to analyze the
   annual and seasonal climatic trends in the Zoige Basin. Results suggest
   that during the past 55years (1957-2011), annual precipitation was
   significantly decreasing at a rate of -0.978 mm/year while the air
   temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET) have increasing
   trends at the rates of 0.029 degrees C/year and 0.755 mm/year,
   respectively. Using three change-point detection methods, one change
   point was detected at 1989 in the annual streamflow series (1960-2011)
   and was adopted to divide the data set into two study periods-the
   baseline period (1960-1989) and the human-induced period (1990-2011).
   The mean annual runoff depth from the White (Black) River in the
   baseline period was 448.9mm (151.5mm), while the mean of the
   human-induced period decreased by 28\% (35\%). It was determined that
   decreases in runoff between the two periods can be attributed to 55\%
   (64\%) from climate variations and 45\% (36\%) from human activities in
   the White River (Black River). Thus, climatic impact exerted more
   important influence on runoff decline in the Zoige wetland basin as
   compared to human activities. This study enhances our understanding of
   the changes caused by climate variations and runoff (and their
   contributing factors) in the alpine wetland.}},

Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{600-612}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   Phylogenetic trees provide a framework for understanding the evolution
   of features (properties, characters or traits) of species, where closely
   related species share many common or similar features. This property of
   phylogenetic trees has practical use in applications such as
   bio-prospecting, where an optimal strategy exploits phylogenetic
   information to target closely related species to search for shared
   features of interest. The implicit corollary of this is that distantly
   related species share few features in common. This property of
   phylogenetic trees is thought to be useful for conservation evaluation
   in choosing sets of species that maximize the present utilitarian
   benefits of extant feature diversity (such as biologically active
   compounds or source systems for genetic engineering) as well as
   maximizing the range of evolutionary trajectories into the future.
   Location
   Global.
   Methods
   Here, we investigate the relationship between phylogenetic trees and
   biological features through both simulation and meta-analysis of 223
   publicly available feature matrices.
   Results
   We demonstrate that phylogenetic tree distance, both in real and
   simulated datasets, is correlated with feature similarity only for a
   short relative distance along the tree, such that there is no
   relationship for the majority of the length of most phylogenetic trees.
   In other words, close relatives share more features than distant
   relatives but beyond a certain threshold increasingly more distant
   relatives are not more divergent in phenotype.
   Main conclusions
   Measures of phylogenetic diversity based upon maximizing phylogenetic
   distance may not maximize feature diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   The application of island biogeography theory in habitat fragmentation
   research assumes a simple relationship between species richness and
   fragment area. However, previous work has suggested that in some cases
   thresholds can be detected, at which the form of the island species-area
   relationship (ISAR) changes abruptly. Piecewise regression has been
   advocated as a suitable statistical technique to model such thresholds.
   Here we first provide a comparative analysis of piecewise regression
   models to determine the prevalence and type of thresholds in habitat
   island ISARs. Second, we evaluate piecewise regression as a method for
   locating thresholds in the ISAR, with particular emphasis on the
   implications of data transformation.
   Location
   World-wide.
   Methods
   Seventy-six habitat island datasets were sourced from the literature. An
   information theoretic approach was employed to compare linear regression
   ISAR models with piecewise regression models. The models were applied to
   untransformed (species-area), semi-log (species-log area) and log-log
   (log species-log area) data. Three types of piecewise regression models
   were evaluated: continuous, discontinuous and zero slope. Model
   performance was compared using the Akaike information criterion. We also
   examined the influence on model performance of taxon, number of habitat
   islands, and area of smallest island.
   Results
   Linear regression models performed best, although piecewise models were
   preferred in a number of cases. Cases in which no model was significant
   were most prevalent in untransformed space relative to the semi-log and
   log-log transformations. Piecewise fits were more prevalent in datasets
   with a larger numbers of islands.
   Main conclusions
   Data transformation is a key part of model selection and needs to be
   explicitly considered, especially in terms of drawing inferences from
   models. Piecewise models, even if selected as the favoured model in our
   analyses, were often ecologically unintelligible in relation to area
   alone. When detected, breakpoint values ranged over five orders of
   magnitude, although with one exception all were under 50ha. Our findings
   highlight the limitations of using individual threshold values to inform
   conservation practice.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb) were measured in
   sediment and water from a representative Western Mediterranean basin in
   South Spain: Guadalhorce River. In the later twentieth century, cities
   such as Malaga (capital of the Costa del Sol), have suffered the impact
   of the mass summer tourism. The ancient industrial activities, abandoned
   mine sites and the actual urbanisation and coastal development,
   recreation and tourism, wastewater treatment facilities, have been
   sources of pollution. This river has been heavily modified, with three
   dams for volume regulation purposes owing to the climatic cycles, with
   some years very dry and others with torrential rains. In this study,
   different indices to assessment of sediment contamination, statistical
   tools (Kruskall-Wallis test, Conglomerate analysis), sequential
   extraction methods and environmental quality guidelines have been
   employed to assess the possible contamination of this basin. Other
   physical-chemical parameters as chloride concentration, pH and
   conductivity were also measured. The results indicated that Ni and Cu
   were the most troublesome metals because they were more easily
   mobilisable than Cr and Pb; Ni exceeds the SQGs guidelines, and Cu
   presents considerable contamination. These metals were derived from
   lithogenic and anthropogenic sources, respectively, according to the
   enrichment factors (EF) values. Ni was the most dangerous because Ni
   concentrations exceeded the threshold effect concentration (TEC) below
   which harmful effects are unlikely to be observed, in 96.6\% of the
   samples analysed and even the probable effect concentration (PEC) above
   which harmful effects are likely to be observed, in 56.6\%. The cause of
   this pollution was postulated to be by abandoned Ni mines, which
   indicates that the pollution from mining persists during several
   decades. Multivariate analyses used in this study provide important
   tools for better understanding of the pollution source identification.}},

Abstract = {{Including positive feedbacks in hydrological models has recently been
   shown to result in complex behavior with multiple steady states. When a
   large disturbance, say a major drought, is simulated within such models
   the hydrology changes. Once the disturbance ends the hydrology does not
   return to that prior to the disturbance, but rather, persists within an
   alternate state. These multiple steady states (henceforth attractors)
   exist for a single model parameterization and cause the system to have a
   finite resilience to such transient disturbances. A limitation of past
   hydrological resilience studies is that multiple attractors have been
   identified using mean annual or mean monthly forcing. Considering that
   most hydrological fluxes are subject to significant forcing
   stochasticity and do not operate at such large timescales, it remains an
   open question whether multiple hydrological attractors can exist when a
   catchment is subject to stochastic daily forcing. This question is the
   focus of this paper and it needs to be addressed prior to searching for
   multiple hydrological attractors in the field. To investigate this, a
   previously developed semidistributed hillslope ecohydrological model was
   adopted which exhibited multiple steady states under average monthly
   climate forcing. In this paper, the ecohydrological model was used to
   explore if feedbacks between the vegetation and a saline water table
   result in two attractors existing under daily stochastic forcing. The
   attractors and the threshold between them (henceforth repellor) were
   quantified using a new limit cycle continuation technique that upscaled
   climate forcing from daily to monthly (model and limit cycle code is
   freely available). The method was used to determine the values of
   saturated lateral hydraulic conductivity at which multiple attractors
   exist. These estimates were then assessed against time-integration
   estimates, which they agreed with. Overall, multiple attractors were
   found to exist under stochastic daily forcing. However, changing the
   climate forcing from monthly to daily did significantly reduce the
   parameter range over which two attractors existed. This suggests fewer
   catchments may have multiple attractors than previously considered.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   To examine if and how species and phylogenetic diversity change in
   relation to disturbance, we conducted a review of ecological literature
   by testing the consistency of the relationship between phylogenetic
   diversity and disturbance and compared taxonomic groups, type of
   disturbance and ecosystem/habitat context. We provide a case study of
   the phylogenetic diversity-disturbance relationship in angiosperm plant
   communities of a boreal forest region, compared with types of natural
   and anthropogenic disturbances and plant growth forms.
   Methods
   Using a large-scale sampling plot network along a complete (0-100\%)
   anthropogenic disturbance gradient in the boreal biome, we compared the
   changes of angiosperm plant community structure and composition across
   plots. We estimated natural disturbance with historical records of major
   fires. We then calculated phylogenetic diversity indexes and determined
   species richness in order to compare linear and polynomial trends along
   disturbance gradients. We also compared the changes of community
   structure for different types of anthropogenic disturbances and examined
   how the relationships between species and phylogenetic diversity and
   disturbance regimes vary among three different life forms (i.e. forbs,
   graminoids and woody plants).
   Important Findings
   Phylogenetic diversity was inconsistently related to disturbance in
   previous studies, regardless of taxon, disturbance type or ecosystem
   context. In the understudied boreal ecosystem, angiosperm plant
   communities varied greatly in species richness and phylogenetic
   diversity along anthropogenic disturbance gradients and among different
   disturbance types. In general, a quadratic curve described the
   relationship between species richness and anthropogenic disturbance,
   with the highest richness at intermediate anthropogenic disturbance
   levels. However, phylogenetic diversity was not related to disturbance
   in any consistent manner and species richness was not correlated with
   phylogenetic diversity. Phylogenetic relatedness was also inconsistent
   across plant growth forms and different anthropogenic disturbance types.
   Unlike the inconsistent patterns observed for anthropogenic disturbance,
   community assembly among localities varying in time since natural
   disturbance exhibited a distinct signature of phylogenetic relatedness,
   although those trends varied among plant growth forms.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Inhaling fine particles (particulate matter with diameter <=
   2.5 mu m; PM2.5) can induce oxidative stress and inflammation, and may
   contribute to onset of preterm labor and other adverse perinatal

   Objectives: We examined whether outdoor PM2.5 was associated with
   adverse birth outcomes among 22 countries in the World Health
   Organization Global Survey on Maternal and Perinatal Health from 2004
   through 2008.
   Methods: Long-term average (2001-2006) estimates of outdoor PM2.5 were
   assigned to 50-km-radius circular buffers around each health clinic
   where births occurred. We used generalized estimating equations to
   determine associations between clinic-level PM2.5 levels and preterm
   birth and low birth weight at the individual level, adjusting for
   seasonality and potential confounders at individual, clinic, and country
   levels. Country-specific associations were also investigated.
   Results: Across all countries, adjusting for seasonality, PM2.5 was not
   associated with preterm birth, but was associated with low birth weight

   PM2.5 (> 20.2 mu/m(3)) compared with the first quartile (< 6.3 mu
   g/m(3))]. In China, the country with the largest PM2.5 range, preterm
   birth and low birth weight both were associated with the highest
   quartile of PM2.5 only, which suggests a possible threshold effect (OR =

   low birth weight, respectively, for PM2.5 = 36.5 mu g/m(3) compared with
   PM2.5 < 12.5 mu g/m(3)).
   Conclusions: Outdoor PM2.5 concentrations were associated with low birth
   weight but not preterm birth. In rapidly developing countries, such as
   China, the highest levels of air pollution may be of concern for both

Abstract = {{Urbanization has an important effect on the soil ecosystem.
   Anthropogenic activities during urban sprawl are the sources and methods
   of migration, transition, and concentration of heavy metals in the soil.
   In this paper, the Yangtze River delta, the fastest urbanization area in
   China, was selected to study the influence of urbanization on heavy
   metal concentration in the soil. The analysis was performed on 218
   samples collected from a typical industrial town in the delta. The
   content of six heavy metals (Hg, Cd, As, Pb, Cu, and Zn) was measured,
   which showed that the soil was seriously polluted by heavy metals,
   particularly Hg. In the study area, human activities were the major
   factors for the heavy metal concentration in the soil. The average
   content of Hg in the 0-500 m zone from the urban core was 1.4 mg/kg,
   about five times higher than the grade II threshold of the Chinese
   Environmental Quality Standard for Soils. The content of Hg, Cd, Pb, and
   Cu decreased gradually with increasing distance from the core of the
   built-up area, especially Hg. The influence of the anthropogenic
   activities was found to be anisotropic, and effects in the direction of
   315A degrees and 225A degrees were most significant. Hg pollution in the
   225A degrees direction of the study area was more serious. These results
   suggested that the urbanization process affects not only the content but
   also the spatial pattern of heavy metal concentration in the soil.}},

   variance components}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{9-15}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In Europe, dynamic olfactometry, as described by the European standard
   EN 13725, has become the preferred method for evaluating odor emissions
   emanating from industrial and agricultural sources. Key elements of this
   standard are the quality criteria for trueness and precision
   (repeatability). Both are linked to standard values of n-butanol in
   nitrogen. It is assumed in this standard that whenever a laboratory
   complies with the overall sensory quality criteria for n-butanol, the
   quality level is transferable to other, environmental, odors.
   Although olfactometry is well established, little has been done to
   investigate inter laboratory variance (reproducibility). Therefore, the
   objective of this study was to estimate the reproducibility of odor
   laboratories complying with EN 13725 as well as to investigate the
   transferability of n-butanol quality criteria to other odorants.
   Based upon the statistical analysis of 412 odor measurements on 33
   sources, distributed in 10 proficiency tests, it was established that
   laboratory, panel and panel session are components of variance that
   significantly differ between n-butanol and other odorants (alpha =
   0.05). This finding does not support the transferability of the quality
   criteria, as determined on n-butanol, to other odorants and as such is a
   cause for reconsideration of the present single reference odorant as
   laid down in EN 13725.
   In case of non-butanol odorants, repeatability standard deviation (S-r)
   and reproducibility standard deviation (S-R) were calculated to be 0.108
   and 0.282 respectively (log base-10). The latter implies that the
   difference between two consecutive single measurements, performed on the
   same testing material by two or more laboratories under reproducibility
   conditions, will not be larger than a factor 6.3 in 95\% of cases.
   As far as n-butanol odorants are concerned, it was found that the
   present repeatability standard deviation (S-r = 0.108) compares
   favorably to that of EN 13725 (S-r = 0.172). It is therefore suggested
   that the repeatability limit (r), as laid down in EN 13725, can be
   reduced from r <= 0.477 to r <= 0.31. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Our review of existing approaches and regulatory uses of
   weight-of-evidence (WOE) methods suggested the need for a practical
   strategy for deploying WOE within a predictive ecological risk
   assessment (ERA). WOE is the process of considering strengths and
   weaknesses of various pieces of information in order to inform a
   decision being made among competing alternatives. A predictive ERA uses
   existing information relating cause and effect to estimate the
   probability that today's action X will lead to tomorrow's adverse
   outcome Y. There appears to be no practical guidance for use of WOE in
   predictive assessments. We therefore propose a strategy for using a WOE
   approach, within an ERA framework, to weigh and integrate outcomes from
   various lines of evidence to estimate the probability of an adverse
   outcome in an assessment endpoint. An ERA framework is necessary to
   connect the results of an assessment to the management goals of concern
   to decision-makers and stakeholders. Within that framework, a WOE
   approach provides a consistent and transparent means of interpreting the
   myriad types of data and information gathered during a complex
   ecological assessment. Impediments to application of WOE are discussed,
   including limited regulatory guidance, limited prior regulatory use, and
   persistent reliance on threshold-based decision-making.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a useful tool for quantifying the
   overall environmental impacts of a product, process, or service. The
   scientific scope and boundary definition are important to ensure the
   accuracy of LCA results. Defining the boundary in LCA is difficult and
   there are no commonly accepted scientific methods yet. The objective of
   this research is to present a comprehensive discussion of system
   boundaries in LCA and to develop an appropriate boundary delimitation
   method.
   Methods A product system is partitioned into the primary system and
   interrelated subsystems. The hierarchical relationship of flow and
   process is clarified by introducing flow-and process-related
   interventions. A system boundary curve model of the LCA is developed and
   the threshold rules for judging whether the system boundary satisfies
   the research requirement are proposed. Quantitative criteria from
   environmental, technical, geographical and temporal dimensions are
   presented to limit the boundaries of LCA. An algorithm is developed to
   identify an appropriate boundary by searching the process tree and
   evaluating the environmental impact contribution of each process while
   it is added into the studied system.
   Results and discussion The difference between a limited system and a
   theoretically complete system is presented. A case study is conducted on
   a color TV set to demonstrate and validate the method of boundary
   identification. The results showed that the overall environmental impact
   indicator exhibits a slow growth after a certain number of processes
   considered, and the gradient of the fitting curve trends to zero
   gradually. According to the threshold rules, a relatively accurate
   system boundary could be obtained.
   Conclusions It is found from this research that the system boundary
   curve describes the growth of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA)
   results as processes are added. The two threshold rules and
   identification methods presented can be used to identify system boundary
   of LCA. The case study demonstrated that the methodology presented in
   this paper is an effective tool for the boundary identification.}},

Abstract = {{Massive changes to ecosystems sometimes cross thresholds from which
   recovery can be difficult, expensive and slow. These thresholds are
   usually discovered in post hoc analyses long after the event occurred.
   Anticipating these changes prior to their occurrence could give managers
   a chance to intervene. Here we present a novel approach for anticipating
   ecosystem thresholds that combines resilience indicators with Quickest
   detection of change points. Unlike existing methods, the Quickest
   detection method is updated every time a data point arrives, and
   minimizes the time to detect an approaching threshold given the users'
   tolerance for false alarms. The procedure accurately detected an
   impending regime shift in an experimentally manipulated ecosystem. An
   ecosystem model was used to determine if the method can detect an
   approaching threshold soon enough to prevent a regime shift. When the
   monitored variable was directly involved in the interaction that caused
   the regime shift, detection was quick enough to avert collapse. When the
   monitored variable was only indirectly linked to the critical
   transition, detection came too late. The procedure is useful for
   assessing changes in resilience as ecosystems approach thresholds.
   However some thresholds cannot be detected in time to prevent regime
   shifts, and surprises will be inevitable in ecosystem management.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation and management of fresh flowing waters involves evaluating

   pollution, the creation of dams and reservoirs, mining, and fishing. To
   assess effects of these changes on associated biotic communities it is
   necessary to monitor and report on the status of lotic ecosystems. A
   variety of stream classification methods are available to assist with
   these tasks, and such methods attempt to provide a systematic approach
   to modeling and understanding complex aquatic systems at various spatial
   and temporal scales. Of the vast number of approaches that exist, it is
   useful to group them into three main types. The first involves modeling
   longitudinal species turnover patterns within large drainage basins and
   relating these patterns to environmental predictors collected at reach
   and upstream catchment scales; the second uses regionalized hierarchical
   classification to create multi-scale, spatially homogenous aquatic
   ecoregions by grouping adjacent catchments together based on
   environmental similarities; and the third approach groups sites together
   on the basis of similarities in their environmental conditions both
   within and between catchments, independent of their geographic location.
   We review the literature with a focus on more recent classifications to

Abstract = {{The relative operating characteristic (ROC) is a widely-used method to
   measure diagnostic signals including predictions of land changes,
   species distributions, and ecological niches. The ROC measures the
   degree to which presence for a Boolean variable is associated with high
   ranks of an index. The ROC curve plots the rate of true positives versus
   the rate of false positives obtained from the comparison between the
   Boolean variable and multiple diagnoses derived from thresholds applied
   to the index. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a summary metric,
   which is commonly reported and frequently criticized. Our manuscript
   recommends four improvements in the use and interpretation of the ROC
   curve and its AUC by: (1) highlighting important threshold points on the
   ROC curve, (2) interpreting the shape of the ROC curve, (3) defining
   lower and upper bounds for the AUC, and (4) mapping the density of the
   presence within each bin of the ROC curve. These recommendations
   encourage scientists to interpret the rich information that the ROC
   curve can reveal, in a manner that goes far beyond the potentially
   misleading AUC. We illustrate the benefit of our recommendations by

Abstract = {{Aims
   In plants, resource allocation to growth and reproduction may depart
   from trade-off expectations if (i) investment in growth and reproduction
   relies on different resource pools, (ii) allocation to reproduction is
   dependent upon reaching some growth threshold or (iii) reproduction is
   developmentally linked to growth, both functions relying on the same
   resource pool. We examined the effects of enhanced resource level on
   patterns of resource allocation to growth and reproduction in holm oak
   (Quercus ilex sbsp. ballota), a Mediterranean evergreen tree.
   Methods
   In the experimental year (2003), we manipulated the amount of soil
   nutrients in autumn (to increase nutrient uptake during shoot elongation
   in the following spring) and soil water in summer (to increase water
   uptake during acorn growth). Indicators of growth and male and female
   reproduction were estimated in the pre-experimental (2002), experimental
   (2003) and post-experimental (2004) years.
   Important Findings
   Fertilized trees produced significantly longer shoots, but the number of
   female flowers per shoot was not affected by treatments. The production
   of male catkins was also enhanced by fertilization. Irrigation did not
   affect the production of female flowers or abortion rates. Growth and
   female reproduction showed no consistent relationship in untreated
   trees, but resource addition elicited a growth-female reproduction
   trade-off in the experimental year. The sign of this significant
   relationship changed in the post-experimental year, indicating the
   existence of lagged effects of resource manipulation on acorn
   production. Overall, patterns of allocation to growth and reproduction
   varied as a function of sex, resource availability and year, a result
   consistent with extreme allocational plasticity in holm oak.}},

Abstract = {{We present a probabilistic sediment cascade model to simulate sediment
   transfer in a mountain basin (Illgraben, Switzerland) where sediment is
   produced by hillslope landslides and rockfalls and exported out of the
   basin by debris flows and floods. The model conceptualizes the fluvial
   system as a spatially lumped cascade of connected reservoirs
   representing hillslope and channel storages where sediment goes through
   cycles of storage and remobilization by surface runoff. The model
   includes all relevant hydrological processes that lead to runoff
   formation in an Alpine basin, such as precipitation, snow accumulation,
   snowmelt, evapotranspiration, and soil water storage. Although the
   processes of sediment transfer and debris flow generation are described
   in a simplified manner, the model produces complex sediment discharge
   behavior which is driven by the availability of sediment and antecedent
   wetness conditions (system memory) as well as the triggering potential
   (climatic forcing). The observed probability distribution of debris flow
   volumes and their seasonality in 2000-2009 are reproduced. The
   stochasticity of hillslope sediment input is important for reproducing
   realistic sediment storage variability, although many details of the
   hillslope landslide triggering procedures are filtered out by the
   sediment transfer system. The model allows us to explicitly quantify the
   division into transport and supply-limited sediment discharge events. We
   show that debris flows may be generated for a wide range of rainfall
   intensities because of variable antecedent basin wetness and snowmelt
   contribution to runoff, which helps to understand the limitations of
   methods based on a single rainfall threshold for debris flow initiation
   in Alpine basins.

Abstract = {{Groundwater nitrate pollution associated with agricultural activity is
   an important environmental problem in the management of this natural
   resource, as acknowledged by the European Water Framework Directive.
   Therefore, specific measures aimed to control the risk of water
   pollution by nitrates must be implemented to minimise its impact on the
   environment and potential risk to human health. The spatial probability
   distribution of nitrate contents exceeding a threshold or limit value,
   established within the quality standard, will be helpful to managers and
   decision-makers.
   A methodology based on non-parametric and non-linear methods of
   Indicator Kriging was used in the elaboration of a nitrate pollution
   categorical map for the aquifer of Vega de Granada (SE Spain). The map
   has been obtained from the local estimation of the probability that a
   nitrate content in an unsampled location belongs to one of the three
   categories established by the European Water Framework Directive: CL 1
   good quality {[}Min - 37.5 ppm], CL 2 intermediate quality {[}37.5-50
   ppm] and CL 3 poor quality {[}50 ppm - Max].
   The obtained results show that the areas exceeding nitrate
   concentrations of 50 ppm, poor quality waters, occupy more than 50\% of
   the aquifer area. A great proportion of the area's municipalities are
   located in these poor quality water areas. The intermediate quality and
   good quality areas correspond to 21\% and 28\%, respectively, but with
   the highest population density. These results are coherent with the
   experimental data, which show an average nitrate concentration value of
   72 ppm, significantly higher than the quality standard limit of 50 ppm.
   Consequently, the results suggest the importance of planning actions in
   order to control and monitor aquifer nitrate pollution. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Climate change is often referred to as the next major force shaping the
   business environment in which companies operate. This study aims at
   contributing to the needs of businesses for quicker and cost-efficient
   ways to strategically plan for the future uncertainty of climate change.
   When structuring the intertextual field around the underlying study,
   there are two main fields of contribution: (1) the systematical approach
   to the complex uncertainty related to climate change and its
   communication from a strategic perspective; and (2) developing novel
   approaches to life-cycle-based methodologies.
   The study includes the life-cycle perspective through a new, simplified
   method of representing product-related climate information in the form
   of an improved SWOT (i.e. Climate SWOT). We approach the climate-related
   structural change of the business environment by addressing questions of
   how usable the Climate SWOT is in building climate strategies; whether
   or not it raises awareness of the life-cycle perspective and climate
   change strategies and if it is able to produce strategic or operational
   changes in the pilot organizations. The focus of this research is
   therefore not the introduction of the tool itself, but rather the
   evaluation of the tool, as perceived by the users. Data were collected
   via surveys targeted at two principal focus groups: users of the tool
   (analysts), in May 2011; and users of the results (decision-makers), in
   September 2011. The results were positive in terms that the tool was
   implemented and seen as useful; it raised awareness both about climate
   issues and the life-cycle perspective and helped in communicating
   product-specific strategies to a wider audience; and it facilitated
   concrete changes. The findings resulted in further refinement of the
   tool to improve its usability. All in all, the Climate SWOT was indeed
   seen as helpful in structuring the situation around climate change and
   to develop strategies. In terms of raising awareness, a significant
   behavioral trigger, the Climate SWOT was perceived by the respondents to
   offer a concrete tool to become aware of climate change, in order to
   relate their activities to the phenomenon and incorporate its
   opportunities and threats into long-term strategic planning. The second
   survey was able to confirm that concrete operative or strategic changes
   had occurred in 50\% of the cases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the wake of global and regional climate change and heightened human
   activities, runoff from some rivers in the world, especially in the arid
   and semi-arid regions, has significantly decreased. To reveal the
   varying characteristics leading to the change in runoff, detecting the
   influencing factors has been important in recent scientific discussions
   for water resources management in drainage basins. In this paper, an
   investigation into attributing the runoff response to climate change and
   human activities were conducted in two catchments (Wushan and Shetang),
   situated in the upper reaches of Weihe River in China. Prior to the
   identification of the factors that influenced runoff changes, the
   Mann-Kendall test was adopted to identify the trends in hydro-climate
   series. Also, change-points in the annual runoff were detected through
   Pettitt's test and the precipitation-runoff double cumulative curve
   method. It is found that both catchments presented significant negative
   trend in annual runoff and the detected change-point in runoff occurs in
   1993. Hence, the pre-change period and post-change period are defined
   before and after 1993, respectively. Then, runoff response to climate
   change and human activities was quantitatively evaluated on the basis of
   hydrologic sensitivity analysis and hydrologic model simulation. They
   provided similar estimates of the percentage change in mean annual
   runoff for the post-change period over the considered catchments. It is
   found that the decline in annual runoff over both catchments can be
   mainly attributed to the human activities, the reduction percentages due
   to human activities range from 59 to 77 \%. The results of this study
   can provide a reference for the development, utilization and management
   of the regional water resources and ecological environment protection.}},

Abstract = {{A pronounced presence of toluene from rotogravure printed matter has
   been frequently observed indoors. However, its consequences to human
   health in the life cycle of magazines are poorly known. Therefore, we
   quantified human-health risks in indoor environments with Risk
   Assessment (RA) and impacts relative to the total impact of toxic
   releases occurring in the life cycle of a magazine with Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA). We used a one-box indoor model to estimate toluene
   concentrations in printing facilities, newsstands, and residences in a
   best, average, and worst-case scenario. The modeled concentrations are
   in the range of the values measured in on-site campaigns. Toluene
   concentrations can be close or even surpass the occupational legal
   thresholds in printing facilities in realistic worst-case scenarios. The
   concentrations in homes can surpass the US EPA reference dose (69 mu
   g/kg/day) in worst-case scenarios, but are still at least 1 order of
   magnitude lower than in press rooms or newsstands. However, toluene
   inhaled at home becomes the dominant contribution to the total potential
   human toxicity impacts of toluene from printed matter when assessed with
   LCA, using the USEtox method complemented with indoor characterization
   factors for toluene. The significant contribution (44\%) of toluene
   exposure in production, retail, and use in households, to the total life
   cycle impact of a magazine in the category of human toxicity,
   demonstrates that the indoor compartment requires particular attention
   in LCA. While RA works with threshold levels, LCA assumes that every
   toxic emission causes an incremental change to the total impact. Here,
   the combination of the two paradigms provides valuable information on
   the life cycle stages of printed matter.}},

   being a stepping-stone for dispersing individuals. Robustness: The
   proportion of patches that must be removed to change each response
   variable beyond a given threshold.
   Question: In fragmented landscapes, how do spatial patterns of habitat
   loss affect the robustness of the insurance effects on biodiversity?
   Does the underlying pattern of habitat connectivity in metacommunities
   play a role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function in the
   face of habitat loss?
   Mathematical method: Using a spatially explicit version of a resource
   competition metacommunity model, we simulated habitat loss in
   metacommunity networks composed of habitat patches connected by links
   for dispersal.
   Key assumptions: Species differ in their environmental preferences.
   Local environmental conditions fluctuate asynchronously so that species
   must disperse in order to persist and maintain productivity. Habitat
   patches are lost sequentially, resulting in gradual fragmentation of the
   metacommunity.
   Results: Habitat loss reduces the amount of spatial insurance conferred
   by the habitat structure on biodiversity by preventing species from
   dispersing to environmentally suitable areas. The robustness of
   metacommunities to habitat loss decreases dramatically when the patches
   with high betweenness centrality are lost. Metacommunities are generally
   most robust when the pattern of habitat connectivity is random and when
   the habitat patches that are lost have low betweenness centrality.}},

Abstract = {{Resilience is defined as ``the capacity of a system to experience shocks
   while retaining essentially the same function, structure, feedbacks, and
   therefore identity (Walker et al. (2004) Ecol Soc 9(2):5). Although
   resilience has been defined and analyzed in ecological as well as
   social-ecological terms, their method of analysis is still under
   development. Recently, the concept of resilience has been directly
   applied to regional development and food security issues where people's
   livelihoods rely heavily on the natural resource base. Resilience of
   social-ecological system (SES) is considered an important component for
   achieving sustainability.
   Within Semi-Arid Tropical Sub-Saharan Africa, communities' livelihoods
   depend critically on fragile and poorly endowed natural resources, and
   poverty and environmental degradation are widespread. People in these
   regions depend largely on rain-fed agriculture, and their livelihoods
   are vulnerable to environmental variability. Environmental resources
   such as vegetation and soil are also vulnerable to human activities. To
   surmount these environmental challenges, human society and ecosystems
   must have a capacity to recover quickly from environmental shock.
   We argue that, in order to operationalize resilience, it is important
   for us to consider resilience in the context of human security of rural
   households in semi-arid tropics (SAT) regions. We consider resilience to
   environmental variability, such as drought, flooding, and social
   changes. We consider resilience of food supply and consumption, health
   status, agricultural production, and livelihoods. Lastly, we consider
   resilience for protecting human security, i.e., survival, livelihoods,
   and dignity. The purpose of the chapter is to show our empirical
   evidence from Zambia and the dynamics of farmers' livelihoods in
   response to various shocks, discuss whether threshold can be defined in
   the context of food security in social-ecological system, and, lastly,
   investigate the role of institutions to build adaptive capacity of the

Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{179-194}},
Abstract = {{Background: The foraging and mate choices of individuals depend on how
   individuals gather information about available options and use that
   information to make decisions. Several alternative decision rules have
   been proposed, but little progress has been made in using observations
   of behaviour to discover what decision rule is being used. An important
   approach has been to combine the rules into an algorithm that chooses
   between them ('the prevailing algorithm').
   Question: How accurately does the prevailing algorithm classify which
   decision rule is most likely to produce observed sequences of
   individuals choosing one item from a pool of many? Can we create better
   algorithms?
   Methods: Using computer simulations, we construct sampling sequences
   that follow the threshold, best-of-n, and comparative Bayes rules. We
   vary sampling cost, pool size, signal variance, and population variance.
   We mimic sequences seen in nature and avoid parameter values in which
   individuals sample infinitely or not at all. We apply the prevailing
   algorithm to determine which rule created each sequence, and measure its
   probability of success. We use a recursive partitioning exercise to
   produce two new algorithms: one based on individuals' sampling
   sequences, and one based on the population's averaged metrics. We
   compare the performances of these two new algorithms and the prevailing
   algorithm. Finally, we apply all three algorithms to previously
   published empirical data sets.
   Conclusions: The prevailing algorithm did no better than a random
   classification, but the individual algorithm had 64\% success and the
   population algorithm had 97\% success. The latter also succeeded in
   identifying the predominant rule even if different individuals of the
   group had different rules. The population algorithm can reliably infer
   what rule the majority of a population is using. However, using observed
   sequences to infer the decision rule of an individual is unreliable.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{681-688}},
Abstract = {{Introduction and objectives. It is important to monitor the threat of
   allergenic pollen during the whole season, because of practical
   application in allergic rhinitis treatment, especially in the specific
   allergen immunotherapy. The aim of the study was to propose the forecast
   models predicting the pollen occurrence in the defined pollen
   concentration categories related to the patient exposure and symptom
   intensity.
   Material and methods. The study was performed in Cracow (southern
   Poland), pollen data were collected using the volumetric method in
   1991-2012. For all independent variables (meteorological elements) and
   the daily pollen concentrations the running mean for periods: 2-, 3-,
   4-, 5-, 6- and 7 days before the predicted day were calculated. The
   multinomial logistic regression was used to find the relation between
   the probability of the pollen concentration occurrence in the selected
   categories and meteorological elements and pollen concentration in days
   preceding the predicted daily concentration. The models were constructed
   for each taxon using data in 1991-2011 (without 1992 and 1996 due to
   missing data in these years) and 1998-2011 pollen seasons.
   Results. The days classified among the lowest category (0-10 PG/m(3))
   (pollen grains/m(3) of air) dominated for all the studied taxa. The
   percentage of the obtained predictions of the pollen occurrence
   fluctuated between 35-78\% which is a sufficient value of model
   predictions. Considering the studied taxon, the best model accuracy was
   obtained for models forecasting Betula pollen concentration (both data
   series), and Poaceae (both data series).
   Conclusions. The application of the recommended threshold values during
   the predictive models construction seems to be really useful to estimate
   the real threat of allergen exposure. It was indicated that the
   polynomial logistic regression models could be a practical tool for

Abstract = {{A scientific advisory panel was convened by the State of California to
   recommend monitoring for chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic
   systems that receive discharge of municipal wastewater treatment plant
   (WWTP) effluent and stormwater runoff. The panel developed a risk-based
   screening framework that considered environmental sources and fate of
   CECs observed in receiving waters across the State. Using existing
   occurrence and risk threshold data in water, sediment, and biological
   tissue, the panel applied the framework to identify a priority list of
   CECs for initial monitoring in three representative receiving water
   scenarios. The initial screening list of 16 CECs identified by the panel
   included consumer and commercial chemicals, flame retardants,
   pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and natural
   hormones. The panel designed an iterative, phased strategy with
   interpretive guidelines that direct and update management actions
   commensurate with potential risk identified using the risk-based
   framework and monitoring data. Because of the ever-changing nature of
   chemical use, technology, and management practices, the panel offered
   recommendations to improve CEC monitoring, including development of
   bioanalytical screening methods whose responses integrate exposure to
   complex mixtures and that can be linked to higher-order effects;
   development or refinement of models that predict the input, fate, and
   effects of future chemicals; and filling of key data gaps on CEC
   occurrence and toxicity. Finally, the panel stressed the need for
   adaptive management, allowing for future review of, and if warranted,
   modifications to the strategy to incorporate the latest science
   available to the water resources community. Integr Environ Assess Manag

Abstract = {{Forest canopy cover and gap fraction are commonly usedmetrics in forest
   ecology. Airborne laser scanning is capable of measuring both very
   accurately, but slightly different estimation methods should be used as
   these metrics are defined differently. In canopy cover estimation the
   proportion of vertical gaps between the crowns is needed for a specific
   area. Canopy gap fraction includes all gaps observed from a single point
   with some angular view range. Canopy cover can be estimated with high
   accuracy as the fraction of first echoes above a specified height
   threshold, because only the large gaps are considered. In gap fraction
   estimation also last echoes should be used so that the effect of the
   smaller gaps within the crowns is considered. Leaf area index can be
   estimated from the gap fraction using a logarithmic model with a single
   coefficient representing leaf orientation. However, sensor effects have
   a strong influence on the estimates, and therefore validation with
   high-quality field data is recommended.}},

Title = {{Floodplain amphibian abundance: responses to flooding and habitat type
   in Barmah Forest, Murray River, Australia}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{149-162}},
Abstract = {{Context Frog species are now targets for delivery of high-value managed
   environmental flows on floodplains. Information on the drivers of frog
   presence and abundance is required to support adaptive management,
   including analysis of the roles of flood frequency, flood timing and
   habitat type.
   Aims This paper describes frog species richness and abundance responses
   to flooding and habitat type in the Barmah Forest, part of the largest
   river red gum forest in the world.
   Methods Surveys were conducted at 22 sites over 6 years, to determine
   species presence, relative abundance, and evidence of breeding. Data
   were then used to examine temporal patterns within and between wet and
   dry years and spatial relationships with site geomorphology, vegetation
   form and wetting frequency.
   Key results Six species were common and widespread, and three were rare.
   The seasonal timing of peak numbers of calling males differed among
   species. The seasonal pattern of calling for each species did not differ
   between wet and dry years; however, significantly lower numbers of frogs
   were recorded calling in dry years. The number of frogs calling was
   significantly higher in well vegetated grassy wetlands. Evidence of a
   positive relationship between wetting frequency and numbers of calling
   males was found for Limnodynastes fletcheri, Crinia signifera and
   Limnodynastes dumerilii. The abundance of tadpoles was significantly
   higher in wet years.
   Conclusions The seasonal timing of flooding in Barmah Forest will
   influence the breeding success of individual species with different
   preferences. Flooding from September to December is required to cover
   most preferred breeding seasons, but longer durations may be required to
   maximise recruitment. This, together with regular flooding of well
   vegetated grassy wetland habitat, will increase the likelihood of
   species persistence and maximise diversity. Insufficient flooding
   frequency will result in reduced frog species richness and abundance.
   Implications Managed flooding is important for frog abundance and
   species richness. This study emphasises the value of key habitats such
   as well vegetated grassy wetlands and reinforces the need to make their
   preservation a priority for management. It has identified knowledge gaps
   to drive future data collection for improved modelling, including a need
   for further research on flow-regime change and frog communities.}},

Title = {{Rating Locomotive Crew Diesel Emission Exposure Profiles Using
   Statistics and Bayesian Decision Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{645-657}},
Abstract = {{For more than 20 years CSX Transportation (CSXT) has collected exposure
   measurements from locomotive engineers and conductors who are
   potentially exposed to diesel emissions. The database included
   measurements for elemental and total carbon, polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, aromatics, aldehydes, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen
   dioxide. This database was statistically analyzed and summarized, and
   the resulting statistics and exposure profiles were compared to relevant
   occupational exposure limits (OELs) using both parametric and
   non-parametric descriptive and compliance statistics. Exposure ratings,
   using the American Industrial Health Association (AIHA (R)) exposure
   categorization scheme, were determined using both the compliance
   statistics and Bayesian Decision Analysis (BDA).
   The statistical analysis of the elemental carbon data (a marker for
   diesel particulate) strongly suggests that the majority of levels in the
   cabs of the lead locomotives (n = 156) were less than the California
   guideline of 0.020 mg/m(3). The sample 95th percentile was roughly half
   the guideline; resulting in an AIHA exposure rating of category 2/3
   (determined using BDA). The elemental carbon (EC) levels in the trailing
   locomotives tended to be greater than those in the lead locomotive;
   however, locomotive crews rarely ride in the trailing locomotive. Lead
   locomotive EC levels were similar to those reported by other
   investigators studying locomotive crew exposures and to levels measured
   in urban areas. Lastly, both the EC sample mean and 95\% UCL were less
   than the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reference concentration
   of 0.005 mg/m(3).
   With the exception of nitrogen dioxide, the overwhelming majority of the
   measurements for total carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
   aromatics, aldehydes, and combustion gases in the cabs of CSXT
   locomotives were either non-detects or considerably less than the
   working OELs for the years represented in the database. When compared to
   the previous American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists
   (ACGIH) threshold limit value (TLV (R)) of 3 ppm the nitrogen dioxide
   exposure profile merits an exposure rating of AIHA exposure category 1.
   However, using the newly adopted TLV of 0.2 ppm the exposure profile
   receives an exposure rating of category 4. Further evaluation is
   recommended to determine the current status of nitrogen dioxide
   exposures.

Abstract = {{Eminent environmental challenges such as remediation of contaminated
   sites, the establishment and maintenance of nuclear waste repositories,
   or the design of surface landfill covers all require accurate
   quantification of the soil water characteristic (SWC) at low water
   contents. Furthermore, several essential but difficult-to-measure soil
   properties, including clay content and specific surface area, are
   intimately related to water vapor sorption. Until recently, it was a
   major challenge to measure detailed water vapor sorption isotherms
   accurately within a reasonable time frame. This priority communication
   illustrates potential applications of a new, fully automated, and rapid
   Vapor Sorption Analyzer (VSA) to pertinent issues in vadose zone
   research. Detailed vapor sorption isotherms for 25 variably textured
   soils were measured with the VSA within 1 to 3 d. Links between
   generated isotherms and pesticide volatilization, toxic organic vapor
   sorption kinetics, and soil water repellency are illustrated. Several
   methods to quantify hysteresis effects and to derive soil clay content
   and specific surface area from VSA-measured isotherms are presented.
   Besides above mentioned applications, potential relationships to
   percolation threshold for solute diffusion in unsaturated soil and to
   soil cation exchange capacity are discussed to stimulate new and
   much-needed vadose zone research.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread climate-induced habitat compression and reductions in
   biological production are beginning to alter food webs in tropical and
   subtropical oceans, but the effects on midtrophic level micronekton
   communities that support commercially important pelagic fishes are
   unclear. The predation habits of yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares, a
   wide-ranging generalist predator with high energy requirements, provide
   rare insights into the distribution and availability of prey communities
   in pelagic regions. We used a modified classification tree approach to
   analyze spatial, temporal, environmental, and biological covariates
   explaining the predation patterns of 3362 yellowfin sampled across the
   eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) during two 2 yr periods occurring a
   decade apart. Persistent zoogeographical assemblages of prey were
   important only in relatively small subtropical regions at the extreme
   northern and southern ranges of the purseseine fishery for tunas. Prey
   biomass patterns for the majority of the samples over most of the ETP (6
   degrees S to 17 degrees N, coast to 150 degrees W) were best explained
   by a tree partition distinguishing samples by sampling period, 1992 to
   1994 and 2003 to 2005. The classification tree revealed that a major
   diet shift had transpired in the heart of the ETP. Yellowfin predation
   had changed from primarily larger epipelagic fish prey in the 1990s to a
   diverse array of smaller mesopelagic species and a crustacean that
   apparently had expanded its range in the 2000s. Partial dependence plots
   from the tree model showed range expansions previously described for
   some prey and unknown for other prey. Diet analysis of selected marine
   predators offers a practical means of monitoring prey communities poorly

   mapping using Landsat imagery}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{23-35}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Classifying surface cover types and analyzing changes are among the most
   common applications of remote sensing. One of the most basic
   classification tasks is to distinguish water bodies from dry land
   surfaces. Landsat imagery is among the most widely used sources of data
   in remote sensing of water resources; and although several techniques of
   surface water extraction using Landsat data are described in the
   literature, their application is constrained by low accuracy in various
   situations. Besides, with the use of techniques such as single band
   thresholding and two-band indices, identifying an appropriate threshold
   yielding the highest possible accuracy is a challenging and time
   consuming task, as threshold values vary with location and time of image
   acquisition. The purpose of this study was therefore to devise an index
   that consistently improves water extraction accuracy in the presence of
   various sorts of environmental noise and at the same time offers a
   stable threshold value. Thus we introduced a new Automated Water
   Extraction Index (AWEI) improving classification accuracy in areas that
   include shadow and dark surfaces that other classification methods often
   fail to classify correctly. We tested the accuracy and robustness of the
   new method using Landsat 5 TM images of several water bodies in Denmark,
   Switzerland, Ethiopia, South Africa and New Zealand. Kappa coefficient,
   omission and commission errors were calculated to evaluate accuracies.
   The performance of the classifier was compared with that of the Modified
   Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML)
   classifiers. In four out of five test sites, classification accuracy of
   AWEI was significantly higher than that of MNDWI and ML (P-value <
   0.01). AWEI improved accuracy by lessening commission and omission
   errors by 50\% compared to those resulting from MNDWI and about 25\%
   compared to ML classifiers. Besides, the new method was shown to have a
   fairly stable optimal threshold value. Therefore, AWEI can be used for
   extracting water with high accuracy, especially in mountainous areas
   where deep shadow caused by the terrain is an important source of
   classification error. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{296-305}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
   revised their recreational water quality criteria, in which adjustments
   were made by approving enterococci (ENT) quantitative PCR (qPCR) as an
   alternative; rapid method and advocating the use of predictive models
   for water quality management. The implementation of qPCR-based methods
   and prediction models are meant to decrease the time between sample
   collection and public advisories and notifications. To date, few studies
   have compared qPCR-based models to culture-based prediction models and
   none of these studies have been conducted in coastal estuarine systems.
   In this study, we created prediction models using qPCR-based fecal
   indicator bacteria (FIB) data in dual-use recreational and shellfish
   harvesting waters and compared them to published ENT and Escherichia
   coli (EC) culture-based prediction models in eastern North Carolina
   estuaries. Furthermore, an empirical statistical model was created to
   predict qPCR inhibition levels so that proper remediation techniques can
   be applied when it is a problem. Predictor variable selection in both
   qPCR- and culture-based ENT models was very similar; both models
   included 14-day rain total, dissolved oxygen, and salinity/conductivity,
   with 89 and 90\% of qPCR and culture data described, respectively. Using
   ENT management action thresholds, qPCR- and culture-based models showed
   high accuracy in management decisions. The qPCR model had 92 and 96\%
   accuracy using the 110 and 1000 cell equivalents (CE)/100 ml thresholds,
   respectively, and the culture model had 90\% accuracy in management
   decisions with the 110 MPN/100 ml threshold. EC models for qPCR- and
   culture-based concentrations used similar independent variables (14-day
   humidity, salinity/conductivity, a rain/storm variable, and a measure of
   air temperature), with each model explaining 26 and 55\% of the data
   variation, respectively. When using different thresholds that were logs
   apart for management decisions, the two EC models accurately predicted
   management decisions; qPCR models correctly predicted management
   decisions 96 and 77\% of the time (using 31 and 320 CE/100 ml,
   respectively) while culture models correctly predicted management
   decisions 96 and 88\% percent of the time (with 31 and 320 MPN/100 ml,
   respectively). Equivalency between models was shown in our non-point
   source impacted estuaries, with ENT models performing slightly better
   than EC models. In addition, inhibition of the qPCR was a major issue
   that had to be addressed. An inhibition model was created with easily
   obtained meteorological data and accounted for a high level of data
   variability (adjusted R-2 = 0.82). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to develop techniques to evaluate soil
   phosphorus (P) sorption capacity (PSC) and determine critical soil P
   levels to predict P loss potential for calcareous soils. Seventy-five
   soils mostly from Northern China were analyzed for soil P using four
   extraction methods (water, P-w; carbonate, P-Ols; ammonium oxalate,
   P-ox; and Mehlich 3, P-M3) as well as PSC derived from single-point
   (PSC150) and multipoint sorption (S (t)) isotherms. Strong correlation
   was found between PSC150 and S (t) (r (2)=0.89, p < 0.001). The sum of
   alpha Ca-M3 and beta Mg-M3 as an index of PSC (PSC(CaM3 + MgM3)) was
   most closely related to the maximum amount of P sorbed (S (max)) as
   given by the sum of S (t) and soil initial P setting alpha=0.039 and
   beta=0.462 (r (2)=0.80, p < 0.001). The degree of P saturation (DPS) was

   a split-line regression from P-w against DPS(CaM3 + MgM3) (r (2)=0.87, p
   < 0.05), a change point was identified at 28.1\% DPS(CaM3 + MgM3), which
   was equivalent to 49.2 mg kg(-1) P-Ols and corresponded to a P-w
   concentration of 8.8 mg kg(-1). After the change point, a sharp increase
   in P-w was observed. Our results reveal a new approach to approximating
   DPS from Ca-M3 and Mg-M3 for calcareous soils without the need to
   generate a S (max). We conclude that in the absence of an environmental
   soil test criteria for P, the DPS(CaM3 + MgM3) and P-Ols could be used
   to predict P loss potential from calcareous soils.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionThe co-existence of woody plants and grasses characterize
   savannas, with the horizontal and vertical spatial arrangement of trees
   creating a heterogeneous biotic environment. To understand the influence
   of biogeophysical drivers on the spatial patterns of 3-D structure of
   woody vegetation, these patterns need to be explained over large areas
   to capture the context. Is there a spatially explicit, ecologically
   meaningful way to capture the patterns and context of 3-D woody
   vegetation structure?
   LocationClassification development and testing sites: landscapes in
   Bushbuckridge Municipality, Sabi Sand Wildtuin and Kruger National Park,
   Mpumalanga province, north-east South Africa.
   MethodsThe aforementioned structural classification approach requires
   appropriate 3-D and spatially explicit remote sensing data. A
   LiDAR-based canopy height model (CHM) and volumetric pixel (voxel) data
   from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory Alpha system were used to create
   the structural classification. First, we segmented the CHM images using
   multi-threshold and multi-resolution image segmentation techniques, and
   classified the image segments into four height classes, namely shrub
   (1-3m), low tree (3-6m), high tree (6-10m) or tall tree (>10m). A
   hierarchical a priori approach was used to develop classification
   criteria. The following metrics were calculated for 0.25-ha grid cells
   based on the cover and spatial arrangement of the four height classes:
   canopy cover, sub-canopy cover, canopy layers, Simpson's diversity index
   and cohesion. Top of canopy vegetation was classified using each metric
   at the 0.25-ha scale, with canopy cover being the primary classification
   metric. Subsequently, individual layers identified within the canopy
   were classified using the voxel data. We use a code system for
   describing classes to ensure standardization between different regions;
   a more traditional naming system may be used in addition for
   interpretation.
   ConclusionThis system provides a more comprehensive classification of
   the horizontal and vertical structural diversity of savannas compared to
   the traditional vegetation classification systems. The description of
   multi-layers within the canopy should allow for a sensitive change
   detection method. The classification can be used in many current focus
   areas, including habitat suitability mapping for biodiversity
   conservation, strategic adaptive management and monitoring land-cover
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality indicators are measurable soil attributes that reveal the
   soil productivity response or soil-environment functionality that are
   used to know whether soil quality is improving, remain constant, or
   declining. These characteristics could be assessed by different indices
   such as sustainability index approach (SI) based on the threshold levels
   of soil indicators and cumulative rating approach (CR) based on crop
   production limitations, which show the sustainability of soil ecosystem
   in terms of soil degradation. Since Iran is situated in arid and
   semi-arid climatic conditions, this research was conducted in
   agriculture fields of southeast of Mashhad, Iran for comparing these two
   approaches. Sixty three soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected and nine
   soil properties such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic
   carbon (SOC), soil particle-size distribution, available water holding
   capacity (AWHC), bulk density (BD), air capacity (AC), relative field
   capacity (RFC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were measured. All
   these measurements were considered as total data set (TDS). Principal
   component analysis (PCA) was used to select more effective indicators to
   conform the minimum data set (MDS). There was a strong correlation

   as MDS (pH, SOC, AWC, BD and SAR) were correlated (p<0.01) significantly

   Effective conservation or wishful thinking?}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {{57-65}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Increasingly, conservation professionals and regulatory agencies are
   attempting to identify ecological thresholds that define a point at
   which populations or communities demonstrate a marked response to human
   disturbance. Such thresholds may serve as the foundation for recognizing
   and then imposing limits on the levels of disturbance or types of land
   use. Although an intuitive concept, I argue that there are numerous
   scientific and practical limitations to applying ecological thresholds
   to conservation decision making. First, the concept is limited by the
   lack of a clear and universally accepted definition. Often, a threshold
   is defined as the point at which a population demonstrates a nonlinear
   ecological or biological response to some critical level of disturbance.
   Alternative definitions are premised on different trajectories of
   response or a direct recognition of conservation risks when prioritising
   socioeconomic values. Second, there is no clear or consistent method for
   identifying ecological thresholds including the appropriate response
   variables. Third, there is little evidence to suggest that ecological
   thresholds generalize to other species or populations: this limits the
   efficiency of thresholds as a decision making tool. Fourth, even where
   ecological thresholds are identified for the purpose of regulation or
   conservation planning, there are few examples of effective
   implementation. In comparison, regulatory limits are premised on the
   ecological response of populations to disturbance, but also consider the
   socioeconomic realities of conservation decision making including the
   risk associated with greater levels of development. Limits can be
   identified through participatory decision making processes that allow a
   consideration of potential future conditions within the context of
   current ecological and economic circumstances. When followed with
   long-term monitoring, regulatory limits can improve existing or provide
   new avenues for conservation planning and regulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Soil type maps at the scale of 1 : 1 000 000 are used extensively to
   provide soil spatial distribution information for soil erosion
   assessment and watershed management models in China. However, the soil
   property maps produced through conventional direct linking method
   usually suffer low accuracy as well as the lack of spatial details
   within a soil type polygon. This paper presents an effective method to
   produce detailed soil property map based on representative samples which
   were extracted from each polygon on the 1 : 1 000 000 soil type map. The
   representative sample of each polygon is defined as the location that
   can represent the largest area within the polygon. The
   representativeness of a candidate sample is determined by calculating
   the soil-forming environment condition similarities between the sample
   and other locations. Once the representative sample of each polygon has
   been chosen, the property values of the existing typical samples are
   assigned to the corresponding representative samples with the same soil
   type. Finally, based on these representative samples, the detailed soil
   property map could be produced by using existing digital soil mapping
   methods. The case study in XuanCheng City, Anhui Province of China,
   demonstrated the proposed method could produce soil property map at a
   higher level of spatial details and accuracy: 1) The soil organic matter
   (SOM) map produced based on the representative samples can not only
   depict the detailed spatial distribution of SOM within a soil type
   polygon but also largely reduce the abrupt change of soil property at
   the boundaries of two adjacent polygons. 2) The Root Mean Squared Error
   (RMSE) of the SOM map based on the representative samples is 1.61, and
   it is 1.37 for the SOM map produced by using conventional direct linking
   method. Therefore, the proposed method is an effective approach to
   produce spatial detailed soil property map with higher accuracy for
   environment simulation models.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{In long-lived organisms, intermittent breeding likely evolves as a
   resource allocation strategy for coping with environmental uncertainty
   or individual heterogeneity in condition. In fishes, the phenomenon of
   intermittent breeding is referred to as skipped spawning, and appears to
   be more common at high latitudes or in migratory species with high
   accessory costs of reproduction. We used long-term monitoring data on
   lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to test whether key predictions about
   the frequency of skipped spawning hold in a mid-latitude population of a
   species lacking any obvious costs of reproduction beyond the production
   and fertilization of gametes. We first developed a threshold-based
   method to classify skipped spawners based on gonad size, fish size, and
   fish age. Consistent with life history theory, age-specific frequencies
   of skipped spawning were higher in females than males. The frequency of
   skipped spawning varied among years and was higher in 1994-2011 than in
   1938-1959, perhaps because of food web changes over the past century. In
   temperate lakes, food web structure may be sufficiently variable to
   favor intermittent breeding in long-lived iteroparous fishes, despite
   low accessory costs of reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{There are a variety of applications that require the use of
   comprehensive specification of the weather conditions combined with an
   analysis that uses detailed modeling and simulation. The combination of
   these two elements can make it difficult to achieve the desired level of
   fidelity in a logistically feasible way. An example of this type of
   application is the deployment of surface-based sensors/samplers, which
   is a common practice for emission, and air quality monitoring purposes
   where the proper selection of sites for the measurement equipment is
   critical to an accurate characterization of the emissions. This is
   particularly true in urban environments where the limited availability
   of suitable sites and the non-intuitive dispersion patterns associated
   with the wind flow around the buildings and through the urban canyons
   make site selection difficult. This article demonstrates an improved
   methodology for optimally locating for air quality monitoring equipment
   within this complex and challenging environment. The methodology
   involves a) the utilization of a longer climatological record of
   meteorological observations or gridded reanalysis products to better
   represent the full range of representative meteorological conditions; b)
   reduction of the full climatological record into a subset of
   characteristic meteorological patterns and associated frequencies of

Abstract = {{The generalized mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model has become one of the
   most popular approaches for species delimitation based on single-locus
   data, and it is widely used in biodiversity assessments and phylogenetic
   community ecology. We here examine an array of factors affecting GMYC
   resolution (tree reconstruction method, taxon sampling coverage/taxon
   richness and geographic sampling intensity/geographic scale). We test
   GMYC performance based on empirical data (DNA barcoding of the Romanian
   butterflies) on a solid taxonomic framework (i.e. all species are
   thought to be described and can be determined with independent sources
   of evidence). The data set is comprehensive (176 species), and intensely
   and homogeneously sampled (1303 samples representing the main
   populations of butterflies in this country). Taxonomy was assessed based
   on morphology, including linear and geometric morphometry when needed.
   The number of GMYC entities obtained constantly exceeds the total number
   of morphospecies in the data set. We show that c.80\% of the species
   studied are recognized as entities by GMYC. Interestingly, we show that
   this percentage is practically the maximum that a single-threshold
   method can provide for this data set. Thus, the c.20\% of failures are
   attributable to intrinsic properties of the COI polymorphism: overlap in
   inter- and intraspecific divergences and non-monophyly of the species
   likely because of introgression or lack of independent lineage sorting.
   Our results demonstrate that this method is remarkably stable under a
   wide array of circumstances, including most phylogenetic reconstruction
   methods, high singleton presence (up to 95\%), taxon richness (above
   five species) and the presence of gaps in intraspecific sampling
   coverage (removal of intermediate haplotypes). Hence, the method is
   useful to designate an optimal divergence threshold in an objective
   manner and to pinpoint potential cryptic species that are worth being
   studied in detail. However, the existence of a substantial percentage of
   species wrongly delimited indicates that GMYC cannot be used as
   sufficient evidence for evaluating the specific status of particular
   cases without additional data. Finally, we provide a set of guidelines
   to maximize efficiency in GMYC analyses and discuss the range of studies
   that can take advantage of the method.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in the conservation of threatened and endangered
   species is to predict population decline and design appropriate recovery
   measures. However, anthropogenic impacts on wildlife populations are
   notoriously difficult to predict due to potentially nonlinear responses
   and interactions with natural ecological processes like density
   dependence. Here, we incorporated both density dependence and
   anthropogenic stressors in a stage-based matrix population model and
   parameterized it for a density-dependent population of peregrine falcons
   Falco peregrinus exposed to two anthropogenic toxicants
   {[}dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polybrominated diphenyl
   ethers (PBDEs)]. Log-logistic exposure-response relationships were used
   to translate toxicant concentrations in peregrine falcon eggs to effects
   on fecundity. Density dependence was modelled as the probability of a
   nonbreeding bird acquiring a breeding territory as a function of the
   current number of breeders. The equilibrium size of the population, as
   represented by the number of breeders, responded nonlinearly to
   increasing toxicant concentrations, showing a gradual decrease followed
   by a relatively steep decline. Initially, toxicant-induced reductions in
   population size were mitigated by an alleviation of the density
   limitation, that is, an increasing probability of territory acquisition.
   Once population density was no longer limiting, the toxicant impacts
   were no longer buffered by an increasing proportion of nonbreeders
   shifting to the breeding stage, resulting in a strong decrease in the
   equilibrium number of breeders. Median critical exposure concentrations,
   that is, median toxicant concentrations in eggs corresponding with an
   equilibrium population size of zero, were 33 and 46gg(-1) fresh weight
   for DDE and PBDEs, respectively.Synthesis and applications. Our
   modelling results showed that particular life stages of a
   density-limited population may be relatively insensitive to toxicant
   impacts until a critical threshold is crossed. In our study population,
   toxicant-induced changes were observed in the equilibrium number of
   nonbreeding rather than breeding birds, suggesting that monitoring
   efforts including both life stages are needed to timely detect
   population declines. Further, by combining quantitative
   exposure-response relationships with a wildlife demographic model, we
   provided a method to quantify critical toxicant thresholds for wildlife
   population persistence.}},

Abstract = {{The current study has used Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data
   to estimate the Snow Cover Area (SCA) in Manali watershed of Beas River
   in Northwest Himalayas of Himachal Pradesh, India. SAR data used in this
   study is of Radarsat-2 (RS2) and Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT),
   Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR). The SAR preprocessing was done
   with SAR image processing tools for converting raw SAR images into
   calibrated geo-coded backscatter images. Maps for forest, built area,
   layover and shadow were created and used for masking snow cover in these
   areas. The backscattering ratio of wet snow to reference image threshold
   method with value range from -2 to -3 db was used to estimate wet SCA
   for study area. In this technique, if the threshold is too high (a parts
   per thousand yen-2 db) wet SCA is overestimated and if it is too low (a
   parts per thousand currency sign-3db), this method underestimates the
   SCA. The wet SCA is under/over estimated (+6 \% to-8 \% on average) in
   late spring season due to the inherent terrain and SAR imaging effects
   of layover/foreshortening and shadow and also due to the masking of
   forest areas. Overall, the SCA derived from SAR data matches well when
   compared with total SCA derived from cloud free optical remote sensing
   data products, especially during wet season.}},

   standardized qPCR data treatment, use of normalization via a non-target

Abstract = {{Long-term observational studies conducted at large (regional) spatial
   scales contribute to better understanding of landscape effects on
   population and evolutionary dynamics, including the conditions that
   affect long-term viability of species, but large-scale studies are
   expensive and logistically challenging to keep running for a long time.
   Here, we describe the long-term metapopulation study of the Glanville
   fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) that has been conducted since
   1991 in a large network of 4000 habitat patches (dry meadows) within a
   study area of 50 by 70km in the angstrom land Islands in Finland. We
   explain how the landscape structure has been described, including
   definition, delimitation, and mapping of the habitat patches; methods of
   field survey, including the logistics, cost, and reliability of the
   survey; and data management using the EarthCape biodiversity platform.
   We describe the long-term metapopulation dynamics of the Glanville
   fritillary based on the survey. There has been no long-term change in
   the overall size of the metapopulation, but the level of spatial
   synchrony and hence the amplitude of fluctuations in year-to-year
   metapopulation dynamics have increased over the years, possibly due to
   increasing frequency of exceptional weather conditions. We discuss the
   added value of large-scale and long-term population studies, but also
   emphasize the need to integrate more targeted experimental studies in
   the context of long-term observational studies. For instance, in the
   case of the Glanville fritillary project, the long-term study has
   produced an opportunity to sample individuals for experiments from local
   populations with a known demographic history. These studies have
   demonstrated striking differences in dispersal rate and other
   life-history traits of individuals from newly established local
   populations (the offspring of colonizers) versus individuals from old,
   established local populations. The long-term observational study has
   stimulated the development of metapopulation models and provided an
   opportunity to test model predictions. This combination of empirical
   studies and modeling has facilitated the study of key phenomena in
   spatial dynamics, such as extinction threshold and extinction debt.}},

   Hyalosphenia papilio in 42 Sphagnum (moss)-dominated peatlands in North
   America, Europe and Asia. Based on 1\% sequence divergence threshold,
   our results from single-cell PCRs of 301 individuals revealed 12
   different genetic lineages and both the general mixed Yule-coalescent
   (GMYC) model and the automatic barcode gap discovery (ABGD) methods
   largely support the hypothesis that these 12 H.papilio lineages
   correspond to evolutionary independent units (i.e. cryptic species). Our
   data also showed a high degree of genetic heterogeneity within different
   geographical regions. Furthermore, we used variation partitioning based
   on partial redundancy analyses (pRDA) to evaluate the contributions of
   climate and dispersal limitations on the distribution patterns of the
   different genetic lineages. The largest fraction of the variation in
   genetic lineage distribution was attributed to purely climatic factors
   (21\%), followed by the joint effect of spatial and bioclimatic factors
   (13\%), and a purely spatial effect (3\%). Therefore, these data suggest

Abstract = {{The inherent complexity of the environment is such that attempts to
   model it must operate under simplifications and assumptions. Considering
   predictions from alternative models, with a range of assumptions and
   data requirements, therefore provides a more robust approach. The
   intractability and uncertainty resulting from a suite of predictions may
   hinder the application of science in policy, where a single prediction
   with little ambiguity or uncertainty would be most desirable. Few
   studies modelling species' distributions attempt to present multi-model
   outputs in a format most useful to the non-modelling community, and none
   of these have done so for the marine environment. The problem of
   uncertainty is particularly prevalent in predicting the distribution of
   invasive alien species under climate change. As invasive alien species
   are one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss and may incur
   significant economic costs, the benefit of applying predictions to
   highlight areas of possible establishment and inform policy and
   management may be large. An ensemble prediction is used to assess the
   distribution of suitable habitat for the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea
   gigas, in UK waters both currently and in the future. The ensemble
   incorporates predictions from three species distribution models, using
   data from two global climate models. A method is developed highlighting
   the agreement of the ensemble, further applying threshold values to
   retain information from constituent predictions in the final map of
   agreement. Ensemble predictions made here suggest that Pacific oyster
   will experience an opening of suitable habitat in northern UK waters,
   reaching the Faroe Islands and the eastern Norwegian Sea by 2050.
   Habitat suitability will increase with warming temperatures in the
   English Channel and Central North Sea for this species. The approaches
   applied here can be incorporated into risk assessment frameworks for
   invasive species, as stipulated in the Convention on Biological
   Diversity. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{There is an expectation that climate change will drive turnover in the
   composition of ecological communities. Established methods for
   predicting the degree of turnover and spatial areas and taxonomic groups
   that will be most affected from real data are lacking. We tested a
   combination of spatial modelling tools to make these predictions. Using
   data from systematic vegetation survey plots from the Adelaide
   Geosyncline region, southern Australia, we modelled species turnover as
   a function of bioclimatic and geographic distances and predicted
   turnover using future climate change scenarios for 2030 and 2070. We
   conducted bioclimatic gradient analysis (CCA) on species composition
   data and mapped zones of higher turnover. The method for detecting these
   zones was tested using a simulation of continuous turnover. A phylogeny
   was generated for recorded species and correlations of occurrences of
   phylogenetic groups with species turnover were calculated. Significant
   turnover was predicted for the least severe climate change scenarios and
   near-complete species turnover for the most severe scenario. Gradient
   analysis revealed discrete transitional zones with more rapid turnover,
   which were interpreted as a mesic-arid ecotone. Turnover occurred at
   family level and with increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall
   there was a shift from the prevalence of Ericaceae, Myrtaceae,
   Haloragaceae, Cyperaceae, and Xanthorrhoeaceae to that of Amaranthaceae,
   Malvaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Sapindaceae, and Solanaceae. The mesic end
   of this climate gradient had relatively low rates of turnover and was
   interpreted as a refugium with a tipping point. The translation of
   spatial patterns to temporal change is dependent partly upon scales at
   which community assembly processes operate and predicts relative
   vulnerability, but not rates of change, which can only be measured
   through monitoring. The approach can be applied at any spatial or
   taxonomic scale subject to sufficient data resolution and can inform
   management decisions as to biases in climate change risks.}},

Abstract = {{Large areas of agricultural land around the world are degraded as a
   consequence of dominance by bracken fern (Pteridium spp.). Tropical
   production systems based on shifting cultivation and cattle breeding are
   particularly vulnerable to invasion of this species. In spite of this,
   effective methods for tropical bracken control are limited. Fast-growing
   tree species have been used successfully to out-compete aggressively
   colonizing heliophytes and trigger natural succession. Drawing on a
   traditional Mayan management technique, we evaluate the potential of the
   pioneer tree balsa (Ochroma pyramidale) to control Pteridium caudatum in
   Chiapas, Mexico. We tested different bracken cutting frequencies and
   balsa propagation methods in a factorial randomized block experiment.
   Eighteen months later, we quantified bracken biomass under the young
   balsa canopy. Living bracken rhizome biomass correlated significantly
   with balsa basal area, leaf litter biomass and understorey light
   intensity. While bracken rhizomes persisted in control plots, it was
   completely eradicated in plots with a minimum balsa basal area of
   11m(2)ha(-1). This threshold value was reached in less than 18months
   with any of the tested propagation methods (seed broadcasting, direct
   sowing or nursery seedlings), on the condition of at least monthly
   bracken cutting during the first six months. The ability of fast-growing
   broad-leaved pioneer trees like balsa to quickly out-compete bracken
   fern offers opportunities for large-scale application in tropical rural

   applications. Mayan subsistence farmers traditionally use balsa to
   out-compete invasive weeds, including bracken fern. Here, we highlight
   the usefulness of this method for quick and effective bracken control in

   rotation cycle, creates opportunities to rapidly convert bracken land
   into forest stands with commercial potential, thus providing local

Abstract = {{AimConservation strategies need predictions that capture spatial

   generate these predictive maps generally focus on deterministic
   processes and omit stochasticity and other uncertainty in model outputs.
   Here we present a novel approach to model the means and variance of
   assemblage properties.
   LocationThe western Swiss Alps.
   MethodsWe propose a new approach to processing probabilistic predictions
   derived from stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) in order to
   predict and assess the uncertainty in predictions of community
   properties. We compare the utility of our novel approach with that of a
   traditional threshold-based approach. We used data sampled in 2009 and
   2010 from 192 sites in total for mountain butterfly communities spanning
   a large elevational gradient as a case study and evaluated the ability
   of our approach to model the species richness and phylogenetic diversity
   of communities within an ensemble forecasting framework.
   ResultsOur approach allowed mapping of the variability in species
   richness and phylogenetic diversity projections, in addition to the
   mean, for 78 butterfly species. S-SDMs reproduced the observed decrease
   in phylogenetic diversity and species richness with elevation, a
   consequence of environmental filtering. The prediction accuracy of
   community properties varied along environmental gradients: at low
   elevations, variability was higher for predictions of species richness
   while it was the opposite for phylogenetic diversity.
   Main conclusionsThe use of our probabilistic approach to process species
   distribution model outputs in order to reconstruct communities provides
   an improved picture of the range of possible assemblage realizations
   under similar environmental conditions given modelling uncertainty, and
   helps to inform managers of the usefulness of modelling results.}},

Abstract = {{The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is one of the most significant fishery
   targets in northern seas. The cod occurs also in the brackish Baltic
   Sea, where besides fishing, several abiotic and biotic factors have a
   strong effect on their population dynamics. All cod stocks have
   diminished simultaneously due to heavy exploitation. Maintaining a
   sustainable fishery requires sufficient understanding of the recovery
   process and adequately tailored management plans. In marine habitats,
   temporal environmental fluctuations are often positively autocorrelated.
   Yet the temporal autocorrelation is often disregarded in models
   estimating fishery stock dynamics. For the Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus
   morhua callarias), the main environmental factors are water salinity and
   oxygen concentrations, which determine species distribution and
   reproductive success. The Baltic Sea's oceanographic characteristics
   make the ecosystem sensitive and climate change is expected to convert
   the type and magnitude of environmental fluctuations. This could
   potentially lead to inaccurate stock estimation and requires
   reassessment for any management strategy. We analyzed the recovery
   potential of the Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua callarias) under
   different fishery and environmental scenarios. Our results illustrate
   how the unpredictability of stock size, catch, and recovery increase
   with increasing environmental autocorrelation. Under current
   environmental conditions and threshold methods fishing is at sustainable
   level. However, under more radical environmental fluctuations, like
   global warming, the estimation of cod population recovery becomes more
   difficult. Moreover, the precautionary fishing methods are important for
   population recovery by ensuring more sustainable fishing and preventing
   stock collapses. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Successful implementation of Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM)
   requires practical methods of translating information on system status
   into management actions. Threshold values in ecosystem indicators have
   been demonstrated to provide insight for characterizing change points in
   marine ecosystems and suggested as reference points for EBFM. We used a
   guild based multispecies simulation model of the Georges Bank finfish
   community to quantify tradeoffs and changes among values for proposed
   ecological indicators given alternative fishing scenarios, and tested
   the performance of indicator-based approaches for setting system
   ceilings on annual catches.
   Values for ecosystem indicators were sensitive to the exploitation rates
   on guilds, with total biomass of the community being most sensitive to
   groundfish exploitation rate. Setting ceilings on system-wide annual
   catches was successful in constraining values for indicators and
   revealed levels of system catch associated with indicator change.
   Community composition indicators showed catch thresholds lower than
   provided by the total biomass indicator. Ceilings based on community
   composition indicators more frequently resulted in higher yields and
   fewer species being overfished than when ceilings were set using total
   biomass or when no ceiling was in place.
   Simulations demonstrated that threshold values in ecosystem indicators
   could be used to determine reference points in an EBFM context. The
   broad ranges for threshold values obtained demonstrates the sensitivity
   of such methods to exploitation history, underscoring the need to both

Abstract = {{An analytical method for the quantification of the widely used
   herbicide, glyphosate, its main by-product, aminomethylphosphonic acid
   (AMPA) and the herbicide glufosinate at trace level was developed and
   tested in different aqueous matrices. Their derivatization with
   9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC-Cl) was done prior to their
   concentration and purification by solid phase extraction. The
   concentrated derivates were then analyzed by liquid chromatography
   coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Spiking tests at three
   different concentrations were realized in several water matrices:
   ultrapure water, Evian((c)) mineral water, river water, soil solution
   and runoff water of a vineyard. Except for AMPA in runoff water,
   obtained regression curves for all matrices of interest showed no
   statistical differences of their slopes and intercepts, validating the
   method for the matrix effect correction in relevant environmental
   samples. The limits of detection and quantification of the method were
   as low as 5 and 10ng/l respectively for the three compounds. Spiked
   Evian((c)) and river water samples at two different concentrations (30
   and 130ng/l) showed mean recoveries between 86 and 109\%, and between 90
   and 133\% respectively. Calibration curves established in spiked
   Evian((c)) water samples between 10 and 1000ng/l showed r(2) values
   above 0.989. Monitoring of a typical vineyard river showed peaks of
   pollution by glyphosate and AMPA during main rain events, sometimes
   above the legal threshold of 100ng/l, suggesting the diffuse export of
   these compounds by surface runoff. The depth profile sampled in the
   adjacent lake near a waste water treatment plant outlet showed a
   concentration peak of AMPA at 25m depth, indicating its release with
   treated urban wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Ministry of Health Biomonitoring Study estimated
   exposure of individuals in the Israeli population to bisphenol A (BPA),
   organophosphate (OP) pesticides, phthalates, cotinine, polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and the phytoestrogenic compounds
   genistein and daidzein.
   Methods: In 2011, 250 individuals (ages 20 74) were recruited from five
   different regions in Israel. Urine samples were collected and
   questionnaire data were obtained, including detailed dietary data (food
   frequency questionnaire and 24 hour recall). Urinary samples were
   analyzed for BPA, OP metabolites (dialkyl phosphates), phthalate
   metabolites, cotinine, PAH metabolites, genistein, and daidzein.
   Results and discussion: BPA urinary concentrations were above the limit
   of quantification (LOQ) in 89\% of the samples whereas urinary
   concentrations of phthalate metabolites were above the LOQ in 92-100\%
   of the samples. PAH metabolites were above the LOQ in 63-99\% of the
   samples whereas OP metabolites were above the LOQ in 44-100\% of the
   samples. All non-smoking participants had detectable levels of cotinine
   in their urine; 63\% had levels above the LOQ and the rate of
   quantification was high compared to the general non-smoking population
   in Canada. Median creatinine adjusted concentrations of several OP
   metabolites (dimethyl phosphate, dimethyl thiophosphate) were high in
   our study population compared to the general US and Canadian
   populations. Median creatinine adjusted urinary BPA concentrations in
   the study population were comparable to those in Belgium and Korea;
   higher than those reported for the general US, German, and Canadian
   populations; and very low compared to health-based threshold values.
   Phthalate concentrations were higher in our study population compared to
   the general US population but values were very low compared to
   health-based threshold values. Median creatinine adjusted PAH
   concentrations were generally comparable to those reported for the
   general US population; median creatinine adjusted daidzein
   concentrations were high in our population compared to the general US
   population whereas genistein concentrations were comparable.
   Conclusions: We interpreted observed urinary contaminant levels observed
   in our study by comparing values with health-based threshold values
   and/or values from international human biomonitoring studies. Using this
   data interpretation scheme, we identified two contaminants as being of
   potential public health concern and high priority for public health
   policy intervention: environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and OP
   pesticides. We used the data collected in this study to support public
   health policy interventions. We plan to conduct a follow-up
   biomonitoring study in 2015 to measure ETS and OP exposure in the
   general population in Israel, to evaluate the effectiveness of relevant
   policy interventions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Success in ecological restoration is rarely assessed rigorously due to
   insufficient planning for post-restoration monitoring programs, limited
   funding and, especially, lack of scientifically validated evaluation
   criteria and protocols. In this article, we propose the use of the
   Indicator Value Index technique (IndVal), which statistically determines
   the association of species to one or several particular site types, to
   obtain indicators of success at the early stages of the recovery process
   in restoration projects. Peat bogs extracted by the vacuum method,
   subsequently restored by a moss-transfer technique and regularly
   monitored for similar to 10 years were used as a model system to test
   this approach. We first identified 34 restored sectors of similar to 10
   ha from 4 to II years old in twelve eastern-Canadian bogs. These sectors
   were then classified according to their degree of success in recovering
   a typical sphagnum moss carpet (restoration goal). Then, we
   retrospectively reviewed vegetation communities recorded at the third
   year after restoration to identify indicator species of different
   categories of restoration success, using the IndVal methodology. By
   identifying early indicator species, our method provides a tool that
   guides intervention soon after restoration if a site is not on a desired
   successional trajectory. Typical bog species, namely the bryophytes S.
   rubellum and Mylia anomala and the tree Picea mariana, were indicative
   of successful restoration; while bare peat, lichens and one species of
   ericaceous shrubs (Empetrum nigrum), which cope better under drier
   conditions, indicated sites where restoration failed. A surprising
   finding was that the moss Polytrichum strictum, which is known to
   facilitate the colonization of sphagnum in disturbed peatlands, is an
   early indicator of unsuccessful restoration. This finding made us
   question the nursing role of P. strictum at a cover threshold above ca.
   30\%, when P. strictum could be outcompeting sphagnum and become
   dominant. We conclude that the IndVal method is an effective tool to
   identify early indicators of restoration success when combined with a
   thoughtful examination of species frequency and cover within each site
   type. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study examined whether a wellbeing approach to
   resilience and adaptation would provide practical insights for
   prioritizing support to communities experiencing environmental and
   socio-economic stressors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey, based on a
   purposive sample of 2,196 stakeholders (landholders, hobby farmers, town
   resident and change agents) from three irrigation-dependent communities
   in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin. Respondents' adaptive capacity and
   wellbeing (individual and collective adaptive capacity, subjective
   wellbeing, social support, community connectivity, community leadership,
   in the context of known life stressors) were examined using chi-square,
   comparison of mean scores, hierarchical regression and factor-cluster
   analysis. Results: Statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05)
   were observed between individual (0.331) and collective (0.318) adaptive
   capacity and wellbeing. Taking into account respondents' self-assessed
   health and socio-economic circumstances, perceptions of individual
   (15\%) and collective adaptive capacity (10\%) as well as community
   connectivity (13\%) were associated with wellbeing (R-2 = 0.36; F (9,
   2099) = 132.9; p < 0.001). Cluster analysis found that 11\% of
   respondents were particularly vulnerable, reporting below average scores
   on all indicators, with 56\% of these reporting below threshold scores
   on subjective wellbeing. Conclusions: Addressing the capacity of
   individuals to work with others and to adapt to change, serve as
   important strategies in maintaining wellbeing in communities under
   stress. The human impacts of exogenous stressors appear to manifest
   themselves in poorer health outcomes; addressing primary stressors may
   in turn aid wellbeing. Longitudinal studies are indicated to verify
   these findings. Wellbeing may serve as a useful and parsimonious proxy
   measure for resilience and adaptive capacity.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{366-374}},

Abstract = {{The world has long neglected the negative impacts that carbon (C)
   sequestration has on ecosystem health. Accordingly, the aims of this
   study were to advocate a conceptual C health threshold model devised for
   terrestrial ecosystems while proposing a method by which to qualify the
   C health threshold of ecosystems. Since coupling relationships between
   C, nitrogen (N), and water can shape the response of ecosystems to
   conditions of global climate change, this study concentrated on C
   sequestration, N input, and water erosion impacts on ecosystem health.
   If C storage exceeds the terrestrial ecosystem C health threshold,
   ecological degradation will either take place or ecosystems will fall
   into a sub-health state in accordance with the C health threshold model.
   Additionally, C sequestration engineering approaches, excess N inputs,
   and water erosion destroy the balance of C cycling processes and may
   consequently have an effect on the C health threshold. Therefore,
   analysis related to the interannual variability of C cycles and their
   potential future behavior must take into account mechanisms driven
   through the coupling of water, C, and N cycles. Defining ecosystem
   health will help familiarize and eventually lead to proficiency in
   understanding C health threshold awareness. This will aid in determining
   the appropriate ecological restoration measures to take when dealing
   with climate change impacts, leading to the preservation of
   biogeochemical C cycling native to terrestrial ecosystems. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The realization that complex systems such as ecological communities can
   collapse or shift regimes suddenly and without rapid external forcing
   poses a serious challenge to our understanding and management of the
   natural world. The potential to identify early warning signals that
   would allow researchers and managers to predict such events before they
   happen has therefore been an invaluable discovery that offers a way
   forward in spite of such seemingly unpredictable behavior. Research into
   early warning signals has demonstrated that it is possible to define and
   detect such early warning signals in advance of a transition in certain
   contexts. Here, we describe the pattern emerging as research continues
   to explore just how far we can generalize these results. A core of
   examples emerges that shares three properties: the phenomenon of rapid
   regime shifts, a pattern of ``critical slowing down{''} that can be used
   to detect the approaching shift, and a mechanism of bifurcation driving
   the sudden change. As research has expanded beyond these core examples,
   it is becoming clear that not all systems that show regime shifts
   exhibit critical slowing down, or vice versa. Even when systems exhibit
   critical slowing down, statistical detection is a challenge. We review
   the literature that explores these edge cases and highlight the need for
   (a) new early warning behaviors that can be used in cases where rapid
   shifts do not exhibit critical slowing down; (b) the development of
   methods to identify which behavior might be an appropriate signal when
   encountering a novel system, bearing in mind that a positive indication
   for some systems is a negative indication in others; and (c) statistical
   methods that can distinguish between signatures of early warning
   behaviors and noise.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The intermittent upwelling hypothesis (IUH) predicts that the strength
   of ecological subsidies, organismal growth responses, and species
   interactions will vary unimodally along a gradient of upwelling from
   persistent downwelling to persistent upwelling, with maximal levels at
   an intermediate or intermittent state of upwelling. To test this model,
   we employed the comparative-experimental method to investigate these
   processes at 16-44 wave-exposed rocky intertidal sites in Oregon,
   California, and New Zealand, varying in average upwelling and/or
   downwelling during spring-summer. As predicted by the IUH, ecological
   subsidies (phytoplankton abundance, prey recruitment rates), prey
   responses (barnacle colonization, mussel growth), and species
   interactions (competition rate, predation rate and effects) were
   unimodally related to upwelling. On average, unimodal relationships with
   upwelling magnitude explained approximate to 50\% of the variance in the
   various processes, and unimodal and monotonic positive relationships
   against an index of intermittency explained approximate to 37\% of the
   variance. Regressions among the ecological subsidies and species
   interactions were used to infer potential ecological linkages that
   underpinned these patterns. Abundance of phytoplankton was associated
   with increases in rates of barnacle colonization, intensity of
   competition and predation, and predation effects, and rates of barnacle
   recruitment were associated with increases in mussel growth, barnacle
   colonization, and species interactions. Positive effects on interactions
   were also seen for rates of colonization, competition, predation, and
   predation effects. Several responses were saturating or exponential,
   suggestive of threshold effects. These results suggest that the IUH has
   geographic generality and are also consistent with earlier arguments
   that bottom-up effects and propagule subsidies are strongly linked to
   the dynamics of higher trophic levels, or top-down effects, as well as
   to nontrophic interactions. The approximate to 50\% of the variance not
   explained by upwelling is likely due to more regional-to-local
   influences on the processes examined, and future efforts should focus on
   incorporating such effects into the IUH.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Predicted distributions of invasive species are often not congruent

   niche models (ENMs) and niche-limiting thermal tolerance traits.
   Location Australia and South Africa.
   Methods The red-legged earth mite, Halotydeus destructor, native to
   South Africa, is a major agricultural pest in Australia and has expanded
   its range to areas not predictable from its native range in the last 40
   years. Revisiting recently constructed ENMs for H. destructor, we select
   populations in both native and invasive ranges that appear to occupy
   different niches. We characterize thermal tolerance traits and test for
   acclimation patterns of cold tolerance of these H. destructor
   populations to test for niche shifts.
   Results Australian populations had an increased upper thermal threshold
   for movement and were able to recover from cold stress more rapidly than
   South African populations. Australian populations also differed in trait
   means from the likely source population in South Africa. Acclimation
   patterns were conserved across ranges for most populations, with 10
   degrees C acclimation lowering the onset of and recovery from cold
   tolerance and 15 degrees C raising them when compared with
   field-acclimated populations.
   Main conclusions These results support the prediction, based on ENMs,
   that H. destructor may have undergone a niche shift by adapting to
   environmental conditions in Australia. The increase in thermal
   resistance has implications for how this invasive species will respond

Pages = {{788-799}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{It is very common that only presence data are available in ecological
   niche modeling. However, most existing methods for evaluating the
   accuracy of presence-absence (binary) predictions of species require
   presence-absence data. The aim of this study is to present a new method
   for accuracy assessment that does not rely on absence data. Two new
   statistics Fpb and Fcpb were derived based on presence-background data.
   With generated six virtual species, we used DOMAIN, generalized linear
   modeling (GLM), and maximum entropy (MAXENT) to produce different
   species presence-absence predictions. To investigate the effectiveness
   of the new statistics in accuracy assessment, we used Fpb, Fcpb, the
   traditional F-measure (F), kappa coefficient, true skill statistic
   (TSS), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and
   the contrast validation index (CVI) to evaluate the accuracy of
   predictions, and the behaviors of these accuracy measures were compared.
   The effectiveness of Fpb for threshold selection and estimation of
   species prevalence was also investigated. Experimental results show that
   Fcpb is an estimate of F. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (COR)
   between Fcpb and F is 0.9882, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of
   0.0171. In general, Fpb, Fcpb, F, kappa coefficient, TSS, and CVI can
   sort models by the accuracy of binary prediction, but AUC is not
   appropriate to evaluate the accuracy of binary prediction. For DOMAIN,
   GLM, and MAXENT, finding the threshold by maximizing Fpb and by
   maximizing F result in similar accuracies. In addition, the estimation
   of species prevalence based on binary output with maximizing Fpb as the
   thresholding method is significantly more accurate than simply averaging
   the original continuous output. The best estimate of prevalence is
   provided by the binary output of MAXENT, with an RMSE of 0.0116.
   Finally, we conclude that the new method is promising in accuracy
   assessment, threshold selection, and estimation of species prevalence,
   all of which are important but challenging problems with presence-only
   data. Because it does not require absence data, the new method will have
   important applications in ecological niche modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape heterogeneity, namely the variation of a landscape property
   across space and time, can influence the distribution of a species and
   its abundance. Quantifying landscape heterogeneity is important for the
   management of semi-natural areas through predicting species response to
   landscape changes, such as habitat fragmentation. In this paper, we
   tested whether the change in spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation
   cover due to farming expansion affected the distribution of the African
   elephant in the Tarangire-Manyara ecosystem, northern Tanzania. Spatial
   heterogeneity (based on the normalized difference vegetation index) was
   characterized at multiple spatial scales using the wavelet transform and
   the intensity-dominant scale method. Elephant distribution was estimated
   from time-series aerial surveys using a kernel density function. The
   intensity, which relates to the contrast in vegetation cover, quantified
   the maximum variation in NDVI across multiple spatial scales, whereas
   the dominant scale, which represents the scale at which this maximum
   variation occurs, identified the dominant inter-patches distance, i.e.
   the size of dominant landscape features. We related the dominant scale
   of spatial heterogeneity to the probability of elephant occurrence in
   order to identify: 1) the scale that maximizes elephant occurrence, and
   2) its change between 1988 and 2001. Neither the dominant scale and
   intensity of spatial heterogeneity, nor the probability of the elephant
   occurrence changed significantly between 1988 and 2001. The spatial
   scale maximizing elephant occurrence remained constant at 7000 to 8000 m
   during each wet season. Compared to the findings of a recent, similar
   study in Zimbabwe, our results suggest that the change in the dominant
   scale was relatively small in Tarangire-Manyara ecosystem and well
   within the critical threshold for elephant persistence. The method is a
   useful tool for monitoring ecosystems and their properties.}},

   reviews PVMRM and OLM and points out some scientific parameterizations
   that could be improved (such as specification of relative dispersion
   coefficients) and then discusses an evaluation of the PVMRM and OLM
   methods as implemented in AERMOD using a new data set. While AERMOD has
   undergone many model evaluation studies in its default mode, PVMRM and
   OLM are nondefault options, and to date only three NO2 field data sets
   have been used in their evaluations. Here AERMOD/PVMRM and AERMOD/OLM
   codes are evaluated with a new data set from a northern Alaskan village
   with a small power plant. Hourly pollutant concentrations (NO, NO2,
   ozone) as well as meteorological variables were measured at a single
   monitor 500 m from the plant. Power plant operating parameters and
   emissions were calculated based on hourly operator logs. Hourly
   observations covering 1 yr were considered, but the evaluations only
   used hours when the wind was in a 60 degrees sector including the
   monitor and when concentrations were above a threshold. PVMRM is found
   to have little bias in predictions of the C(NO2)/C(NOx) ratio, which
   mostly ranged from 0.2 to 0.4 at this site. OLM overpredicted the ratio.
   AERMOD overpredicts the maximum NOx concentration but has an
   underprediction bias for lower concentrations. AERMOD/PVMRM overpredicts
   the maximum C(NO2) by about 50\%, while AERMOD/OLM overpredicts by a
   factor of 2. For 381 hours evaluated, there is a relative mean bias in
   C(NO2) predictions of near zero for AERMOD/PVMRM, while the relative
   mean bias reflects a factor of 2 overprediction for AERMOD/OLM.
   Implications: This study was initiated because the new stringent 1-hr
   NO2 NAAQS has prompted modelers to more widely use the PVMRM and OLM
   methods for conversion of NOx to NO2 in the AERMOD regulatory model. To
   date these methods have been evaluated with a limited number of data
   sets. This study identified a new data set of ambient pollutant and
   meteorological monitoring near an isolated power plant in Wainwright,
   Alaska. To supplement the existing evaluations, this new data were used
   to evaluate PVMRM and OLM. This new data set has been and will be made
   available to other scientists for future investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of reliable background values of potentially toxic metals
   in sediments requires detailed integration of geochemical data with
   accurate sedimentological studies. Through analysis of 60 soil samples
   from the Pisa coastal plain, this study shows to what extent sediment
   provenance and facies characteristics may influence the natural
   distribution of potentially toxic metals (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb) within
   alluvial and coastal sediments. Metals supplied to the alluvial plain
   are mostly concentrated within the finest sediment fraction (floodplain
   clays), while coarser crevasse and overbank deposits exhibit invariably
   lower metal contents. Beach-ridge sands display the lowest metal
   concentrations. Transport of ophiolitic detritus by the longshore drift
   may account for locally high Cr concentrations within beach deposits.
   Geochemical fingerprinting of individual facies associations in terms of
   natural metal contents results in the construction of a
   geologically-based geochemical map. This map offers a more reliable
   depiction of spatial distribution of background levels than
   interpolation techniques based uniquely upon statistical methods.
   Matching background values against metal concentrations from topsoil
   samples leads to the reliable assessment of the pollution status of Pisa
   coastal plain. Metal contents exceeding the threshold values designated
   for contaminated areas (Cr) simply reflect catchment geology, and are
   not the product of artificial contamination. On the other hand,
   anthropogenic disturbance may be detected even where metal contents (Pb,
   Cu) lie below the threshold values. The use of sedimentological criteria
   is presented here as a pragmatic tool to enhance predictability of
   natural metal contents in sediments, with obvious positive feedbacks for
   legislative purposes and environmental protection.}},

Abstract = {{The biomanipulation of Lake Vesijarvi in southern Finland putatively
   changed the lake ecosystem resulting in a clear-water state, but the
   dynamics behind the observed change remained unverified. We used a
   general analytical approach to identify abrupt transitions in the
   long-term monitoring data of Lake Vesijarvi. Methods included the
   identification of breakpoints in chlorophyll a (response variable), in
   total phosphorus (TP; key driver) and in large-bodied cladocerans
   (feedback mechanism of biomanipulation). In addition, we characterised
   the frequency distribution and temporal variance of the response
   variable, as well as the interaction between TP and chlorophyll a.
   According to long-term records, biomanipulation resulted in two distinct
   states: (i) a eutrophic state, where chlorophyll a and TP were linearly
   correlated and (ii) a mesotrophic state, where the key driver and
   response variables were not significantly correlated. The changed
   relationship between the key driver and response variables, together
   with the increase in the body size of cladocerans, suggested a
   hysteresis-type transition phase. However, the frequency distribution
   and the temporal variance of chlorophyll a agreed also with a
   threshold-type of transition. Zooplankton seemed to be more important in
   maintaining the clear-water state than previously reported. Our results
   highlight the role of long-term monitoring data and the characterisation

Abstract = {{This study presents and analyzes the data of the Italian system for

   freezing equipments. In fact, the wastes of cooling and freezing
   equipments have a high environmental impact. Indeed, in their compressor
   oil and insulation polyurethane (PU) foams chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)
   ozone-depleting gases are still present. In the period 2001-2004
   Northern Italy resulted the main source in Europe of CFCs. The European
   Directive on WEEE management was enacted in 2002, but in Italy it was
   implemented by the legislative Decree in 2005 and it became operational
   in 2008. Actually, in 2008 the national WEEE Coordination Centre was
   founded in order to organize the WEEE pick-up process and to control
   collection, recovery and recycling targets. As a result, in 2010 the
   average WEEE collection per capita exceeded the threshold of more than 4
   kg per inhabitant, as well as cooling and freezing appliances
   represented more than one fourth of the Italian WEEE collection stream.
   During the treatment of end-of-life cooling and freezing equipments,

Abstract = {{Identifying the range of appropriate fire return intervals is crucial
   for ecosystem management in fire-prone environments. Plant vital
   attributes and changes in their associated trait values with time since
   fire are important indicators of suitable fire interval bounds to
   conserve biodiversity. However, using vital attributes to derive
   prescriptions for acceptable fire intervals remains challenging due to
   (1) uncertainty regarding how traits are best measured, (2) uncertainty
   in the acceptable ranges of trait values to avoid local extinctions, and
   (3) potential for variability among populations in the time taken
   postfire to reach trait threshold values. Using a time-since-fire
   gradient in contrasting mallee and mallee-heath vegetation types of
   southwestern Australia, we calculate, compare, and aggregate fire
   interval bound predictions from nine serotinous non-resprouters and
   seven serotinous resprouters across these three sources of uncertainty
   or variation. Relationships between time since fire and both trait
   measures reflecting minimum fire interval (mean number of closed fruit
   per plant or proportion of plants with closed fruit) were typically
   significant, had reasonable goodness of fit, and showed similar patterns
   of change with time since fire. Significant relationships reflecting
   maximum fire interval were less frequent but were more commonly detected
   using direct measures of mortality than using evidence for decline in
   reproductive potential. Of the two sources of uncertainty, trait value
   threshold selection caused more substantial differences in estimated
   interval bounds than trait measurement method. Variation between
   populations increased with greater estimated minimum interval length
   and, in some species, rendered interval estimates of limited practical
   value. On balance, we conclude that measures of vital attribute traits
   offer a transparent approach for estimating fire interval bounds at the
   plant community level, but selection of trait value thresholds is in
   need of stronger biological justification in their application. Further,
   variation between populations should be explicitly sampled if fire
   interval estimates are to be applied across the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the world's highest and largest plateau.
   Due to increasing demands for environment exploration and tourism, a
   large transitional area is required for altitude adaptation. Hehuang
   valley, which locates in the transition zone between the Loess Plateau
   and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, has convenient transportation and
   relatively low elevation. Our question is whether the geographic
   conditions here are appropriate for adapted stay before going into the
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Therefore, in this study, we examined the
   potential use of ecological niche modeling (ENM) for mapping current and
   potential distribution patterns of human settlements. We chose the
   Maximum Entropy Method (Maxent), an ENM which integrates climate, remote
   sensing and geographical data, to model distributions and assess land
   suitability for transition areas. After preprocessing and selection, the
   correlation between variables and spatial autocorrelation input data
   were removed and 106 occurrence points and 9 environmental layers were
   determined as the model inputs. The threshold-independent model
   performance was reasonable according to 10 times model running, with the
   area under the curve (AUC) values being 0.917 +/- 0.01, and 0.923 +/-
   0.002 for test data. Cohen's kappa coefficient of model performance was
   0.848. Results showed that 82.22\% of the study extent was not suitable
   for human settlement. Of the remaining areas, highly suitable areas
   accounted for 1.19\%, moderately for 5.3\% and marginally for 11.28\%.
   These suitable areas totaled 418.79 km(2), and 86.25\% of the sample
   data was identified in the different gradient of suitable area. The
   decisive environmental factors were slope and two climate variables:
   mean diurnal temperature range and temperature seasonality. Our model
   showed a good performance in mapping and assessing human settlements.
   This study provides the first predicted potential habitat distribution
   map for human settlement in Ledu County, which could also help in land
   use management.}},

Abstract = {{Species distribution model (SDMs) is increasingly used to determine the
   distribution range of individual species and identify biodiversity
   hotspots. Of many technical issues, model over-fitting or
   over-parameterization is a major concern, which can lead to severe
   under-prediction. However, under-fitting and over-prediction may also
   occur if species requirements for environment are inadequately modeled.
   We used the collection data of stoneflies (Plecoptera, Insecta) from
   Illinois, USA to examine how often and severely maximum entropy (Maxent)
   over- or under-predicts species richness and species-occurrence
   frequency. A recently proposed AICc-based method (Warren and Seifert,
   2011) was used for model-complexity control or regularization.
   Twenty-nine historically well-sampled watersheds were used to validate
   the predictions. The standard models, which used the default
   regularization (beta = 1), over- or under-predicted, depending on the
   watershed, species, and threshold used for converting suitability score
   into species presence-absence. The AICc-selected models (beta = 7-40)
   used 77\% less parameters, but often strongly and consistently
   over-predicted. Three thresholds, equal training sensitivity and
   specificity, maximizing training sensitivity and specificity (MTSS) and
   minimum training presence, yielded most accurate estimates. Accordingly,
   we developed standard models for 41 species and identified the
   historically species-rich watersheds in Illinois. Our results offer new

Abstract = {{Identification of ecological thresholds is important both for
   theoretical and applied ecology. Recently, Baker and King (2010, King
   and Baker 2010) proposed a method, threshold indicator analysis (TITAN),
   to calculate species and community thresholds based on indicator species
   scores adapted from Dufrene and Legendre (1997). We tested the ability
   of TITAN to detect thresholds using models with (broken-stick,
   disjointed broken-stick, dose-response, step-function, Gaussian) and
   without (linear) definitive thresholds. TITAN accurately and
   consistently detected thresholds in step-function models, but not in
   models characterized by abrupt changes in response slopes or response
   direction. Threshold detection in TITAN was very sensitive to the
   distribution of 0 values, which caused TITAN to identify thresholds
   associated with relatively small differences in the distribution of 0
   values while ignoring thresholds associated with large changes in
   abundance. Threshold identification and tests of statistical
   significance were based on the same data permutations resulting in
   inflated estimates of statistical significance. Application of
   bootstrapping to the split-point problem that underlies TITAN led to
   underestimates of the confidence intervals of thresholds. Bias in the
   derivation of the z-scores used to identify TITAN thresholds and
   skewedness in the distribution of data along the gradient produced TITAN
   thresholds that were much more similar than the actual thresholds. This
   tendency may account for the synchronicity of thresholds reported in
   TITAN analyses. The thresholds identified by TITAN represented disparate
   characteristics of species responses that, when coupled with the
   inability of TITAN to identify thresholds accurately and consistently,
   does not support the aggregation of individual species thresholds into a
   community threshold.}},

Abstract = {{Cuffney and Qian (2013) performed numerous simulations to demonstrate
   potential flaws in Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN), a method
   for interpreting taxon contributions to community change along novel
   environmental gradients. Based on their simulations, they concluded
   that: 1) TITAN is not an effective method for detecting different types
   of statistical thresholds in trend lines, 2) permutation results in
   highly significant p-values even for splits that are not thresholds, and
   3) coincident change points may arise as an artifact of inaccuracies,
   imprecision, and systematic bias in both change-point estimation and
   TITAN's bootstrap. The critique raises some important concerns, but
   because of significant misunderstanding, it is based on analyses that
   violate basic assumptions of both TITAN and indicator species analysis
   (IndVal), and thus, constitutes a straw man that cannot be used to
   evaluate their performance. We demonstrate that the critique: 1)
   fundamentally misrepresents TITAN's primary goals; 2) simulates taxon
   abundances based on unrealistic statistical models that fail to
   represent important empirical patterns present in Cuffney and Qian's own
   published data sets (i.e., negative binomial distributions, frequent
   absences a function of the predictor); 3) tests TITAN's ability to
   identify breaks in trend lines distorted by log-transformation that do
   not match the greatest change in the simulated response, leading to
   misinterpretation of expected and previously documented behavior by
   TITAN as errors; 4) misinterprets TITAN's use of p-values while ignoring
   diagnostic indices of purity and reliability for identifying robust
   indicator taxa; and 5) asserts that bootstrapped change-point quantiles
   in TITAN are too narrow despite published results to the contrary. Last,
   in contrast to the claim that change-point synchrony may be an artifact
   of the technique, we show that: 6) analysis of published data using
   completely independent methods (i.e., scatterplots of abundance data or
   generalized additive models) also reveals synchrony in the nonlinear
   decline of numerous taxa in corroboration of TITAN and its underlying
   conceptual model. Thus, Cuffney and Qian have not identified any serious
   limitations of TITAN because their critique is based on
   misinterpretation of TITAN's assumptions and primary objectives.
   However, their critique does highlight the need for clarification of the
   appropriate uses, potential misuses, and limitations of TITAN and other
   methods for ecological analysis.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Previous U. S. population modeling studies have reported
   that urinary cadmium (Cd) excretion patterns differ with age, sex, and
   dietary exposure; associations between Cd exposures and health outcomes
   also have differed by age and sex. Therefore, it is important to test
   models used to estimate Cd exposures across an expanded Cd-exposure
   range.
   OBJECTIVES: We estimated relative Cd exposures from both diet and
   smoking in low- and high-exposure scenarios to provide data for
   improving risk assessment calculations.
   METHODS: We used a Cd toxicokinetic-based model to estimate Cd exposures
   based on urinary Cd levels measured for 399 persons in a low-exposure
   area (Bangkok) and 6,747 persons in a high-exposure area (Mae Sot) in
   Thailand.
   RESULTS: In Bangkok, we estimated dietary Cd exposures of 50-56 mu g/day
   for males and 21-27 mu g/day for females 20-59 years of age who never
   smoked. In Mae Sot, we estimated dietary Cd exposures of 188-224 mu
   g/day for males and 99-113 mu g/day for females 20-59 years of age who
   never smoked. In Bangkok, we estimated Cd exposures from smoking to be
   5.5-20.4 mu g/day for male smokers 20-59 years of age. In Mae Sot, we
   estimated Cd exposures from smoking to be 9.8-26 mu g/day for male heavy
   smokers and 26 mu g/day for female heavy smokers.
   CONCLUSION: This study provides estimates of Cd exposures from diet and
   smoking in low-and high-exposure scenarios. Our findings suggest a
   relatively small safety margin between the established tolerable Cd
   reference exposure of 62 mu g/day and exposure levels previously
   associated with evidence of kidney and bone effects in Mae Sot
   residents, where dietary Cd exposures among women were only 1.6-2.1
   times the reference value.}},

Abstract = {{There are two kinds of land policies, the smallholding land policy (SLP)
   and the farmland policy (FLP) in China. The farmland nutrient dynamics
   under the two land policies were analysed with the soil system budget
   method. The averaged nitrogen (N) input of the SLP and the FLP over
   sixteen years increased about 23.9\% and 33.3\%, respectively and the
   phosphorus (P) input climbed about 39.1\% and 42.3\%, respectively. The
   statistical analysis showed that the land policies had significant
   impacts on N and P input from fertilizer and manure, but did not
   obviously affect the N input from seeds and biological N fixation. The
   efficiency percentage of N of the SLP and the FLP climbed about 54.5\%
   and 59.4\%, respectively, and the P efficiency improved by 52.7\% and
   82.6\%, respectively. About the nutrient output, the F-test analysis
   indicated that the land polices had remarkable impacts on N output by
   crop uptake, ammonia volatilisation, denitrification, leaching and
   runoff, and P output by uptake, runoff, and leach. The balance showed
   that the absolute loss of N from land deceased about 43.6\% and 46.0\%,
   respectively, in the SLP and the FLP, and P discharge reduced about
   34.2\% and 75.2\%, respectively. The F-test analysis of N and P
   efficiency and balance of between two polices both indicated that the
   FLP had significant impact on nutrient dynamic. With the Mitscherlich
   model, the correlations between nutrient input and crop uptake, usage
   efficiency and loss were analysed and showed that was a threshold value
   for the optimal nutrient input with the highest efficiency rate. For the
   optimal nutrient efficiency, the space for extra P addition was bigger
   than the N input. The FLP have more advantage than the SIP on the crop
   yield, nutrient efficiency and environmental discharge. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In a wide range of contexts, including predator avoidance, medical
   decision-making and security screening, decision accuracy is
   fundamentally constrained by the trade-off between true and false
   positives. Increased true positives are possible only at the cost of
   increased false positives; conversely, decreased false positives are
   associated with decreased true positives. We use an integrated
   theoretical and experimental approach to show that a group of
   decision-makers can overcome this basic limitation. Using a mathematical
   model, we show that a simple quorum decision rule enables individuals in
   groups to simultaneously increase true positives and decrease false
   positives. The results from a predator-detection experiment that we
   performed with humans are in line with these predictions: (i) after
   observing the choices of the other group members, individuals both
   increase true positives and decrease false positives, (ii) this effect
   gets stronger as group size increases, (iii) individuals use a quorum
   threshold set between the average true- and false- positive rates of the
   other group members, and (iv) individuals adjust their quorum adaptively
   to the performance of the group. Our results have broad implications for
   our understanding of the ecology and evolution of group-living animals
   and lend themselves for applications in the human domain such as the
   design of improved screening methods in medical, forensic, security and
   business applications.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To demonstrate the application of predictive species distribution
   modelling methods to habitat mapping and assessment of percentage
   area-based conservation targets. Location The NE Atlantic deep sea (UK
   and Irish extended continental shelf limits). Methods MaxEnt modelling
   of three listed habitats (Lophelia pertusa (Linnaeus, 1758) reef
   (LpReef), Pheronema carpenteri (WyvilleThomson, 1869) aggregations
   (PcAggs) and Syringammina fragilissima (Brady, 1883) aggregations
   (SfAggs)), with some pre-selection of variables by generalized additive
   modelling. Models are validated using repeated 70/30 build/test data
   splits using AUC and threshold-dependent assessment methods. Predicted
   distribution maps are used to assess the adequacy of existing area
   closures for the protection of listed habitats and to assess percentage
   representation of each community within existing MPA networks. Results
   Model performances are rated as fair (LpReef), excellent (PcAggs) and
   good (SfAggs). Current closures are focused on the protection of
   cold-water coral reef and incidentally capture some SfAggs suitable
   environments, but largely fail to protect PcAggs. Considering the wider
   network of MPAs in the study region, approximately 23\% (LpReef), 2\%
   (PcAggs) and 6\% (SfAggs) of the area predicted as suitable for each
   habitat respectively is contained within an MPA. Main conclusions To
   date, decisions on area closures for the protection of listed' deep-sea
   habitats have been based on maps of recorded presence of species that
   are taken as being indicative of that habitat. Predictive habitat
   modelling may provide a useful method of better estimating the extent of
   listed habitats, providing direction for future MPA establishment and a
   means of assessing MPA network effectiveness against politically set
   percentage targets. Given the coarse resolution of the model,
   percentages should be taken as maximal figures, with habitat occurrence

Abstract = {{Urbanization has accelerated rapidly over the last century, which has
   caused surfaces in natural ecosystems to shift to impervious surfaces.
   As a result, urban watershed ecosystems show altered physical, chemical
   and ecological process. As an important part of watershed management,
   urbanization has become one of the key issues involved in the
   deterioration of water quality. Impervious surface area (ISA) has been
   recognized as a key indicator of the effects of non-point runoff and
   water quality within a particular watershed. Numerous case studies have
   been conducted to investigate the relationship between urbanization and
   water quality in different study areas. However, there is still a lack
   of understanding regarding quantitative analysis of the threshold
   between urbanization and water quality indicators. This study was
   conducted to improve the understanding of how to quantify a threshold
   between urbanization and water quality, taking the rapid urbanization
   zone of Shenzhen, China as a case study. To accomplish this, ISA was
   extracted from the Landsat (TM) image using a linear spectral mixture
   method to quantify the urbanization. The relationship between water
   quality indicators and ISA was then analyzed by nonlinear regression,
   and the threshold between ISA and the chemical indicators of water
   quality was investigated using the statistical segment approach method.
   The results indicate that the water quality indicators and ISA are
   significantly correlated, and that, with the exception of Zn, Pb, and
   CN, the water quality indicators had R (2) values greater than 0.45.
   Furthermore, with the exception of Zn, F-, Pb and oils, water quality
   indicators were found to have an ISA threshold of 36.9-52.9 \%,
   indicating that it is important to control the ISA below 36.9 \% in
   urbanization watersheds to enable effective urban watershed management.}},

Abstract = {{The authors present a method to predict fish survival under exposure to
   fluctuating concentrations and repeated pulses of a chemical stressor.
   The method is based on toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic modeling using the
   general unified threshold model of survival (GUTS) and calibrated using
   raw data from standard fish acute toxicity tests. The model was
   validated by predicting fry survival in a fish early life stage test.
   Application of the model was demonstrated by using Forum for
   Co-ordination of Pesticide Fate Models and Their Use surface water
   (FOCUS-SW) exposure patterns as model input and predicting the survival
   of fish over 485 d. Exposure patterns were also multiplied by factors of
   five and 10 to achieve higher exposure concentrations for fish survival
   predictions. Furthermore, the authors quantified how far the exposure
   profiles were below the onset of mortality by finding the corresponding
   exposure multiplication factor for each scenario. The authors calculated
   organism recovery times as additional characteristic of toxicity as well
   as number of peaks, interval length between peaks, and mean duration as
   additional characteristics of the exposure pattern. The authors also
   calculated which of the exposure patterns had the smallest and largest
   inherent potential toxicity. Sensitivity of the model to parameter
   changes depends on the exposure pattern and differs between GUTS
   individual tolerance and GUTS stochastic death. Possible uses of the
   additional information gained from modeling to inform risk assessment

Abstract = {{Aim Species distribution models have been widely used to tackle
   ecological, evolutionary and conservation problems. Most species
   distribution modelling techniques produce continuous suitability
   predictions, but many real applications (e.g. reserve design, species
   invasion and climate change impact assessment) and model evaluations
   require binary outputs, and thresholds are needed for these
   transformations. Although there are many threshold selection methods for
   presence/absence data, it is unclear whether these are suitable for
   presence-only data. In this paper, we investigate mathematically and
   empirically which of the existing threshold selection methods can be
   used confidently with presence-only data. Location We used real
   spatially explicit environmental data derived from the western part of
   the state of Victoria, south-eastern Australia, and simulated species
   distributions within this area. Methods Thirteen existing threshold
   selection methods were investigated mathematically to see whether the
   same threshold can be produced using either presence/absence data or
   presence-only data. We further adopted a simulation approach, created
   many virtual species with differing prevalences in a real landscape in
   south-eastern Australia, generated data sets with different proportions
   of pseudo-absences, built eight types of models with four modelling
   techniques, and investigated the behaviours of four threshold selection
   methods in these situations. Results Three threshold selection methods
   were not affected by pseudo-absences, including max SSS (which is based
   on maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity), the prevalence of
   model training data and the mean predicted value of a set of random
   points. Max SSS produced higher sensitivity in most cases and higher
   true skill statistic and kappa in many cases than the other methods. The
   other methods produced different thresholds from presence-only data to
   those determined from presence/absence data. Main conclusions Max SSS is
   a promising method for threshold selection when only presence data are
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Erosion of sand or other granular material is a subject of utmost
   importance in several fields of practical interest, including industrial
   processes or environmental issues. Resulting from intricate interaction
   between the incident flow field and localized body forces responsible
   for the granular material cohesion, erosion is a particularly complex
   phenomenon. The present work addresses this problem, proposing a
   numerical method to compute the time evolution of a sand dune subjected
   to aeolian erosion, along with the associated entrainment and deposition
   fluxes. Turbulent fluid flow is computed through a three-dimensional
   Navier-Stokes solver based on a generalized coordinate system. A
   Lagrangian approach is adopted for tracking the trajectories of
   particles entrained in the saltation regime, thus allowing prediction of
   the corresponding deposition locations. Different models for saltation
   fluxes are tested, along with several formulations for the
   creeping-to-saltation flux ratio, creeping threshold and creeping
   distance. Comparison with results from wind tunnel experiments is very
   encouraging, stressing the relative importance of creeping in the
   erosion process for the presently studied conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Ongoing pollution and improving analytical techniques reveal more and
   more anthropogenic substances in drinking water sources, and
   incidentally in treated water as well. In fact, complete absence of any
   trace pollutant in treated drinking water is an illusion as current
   analytical techniques are capable of detecting very low concentrations.
   Most of the substances detected lack toxicity data to derive safe levels
   and have not yet been regulated. Although the concentrations in treated
   water usually do not have adverse health effects, their presence is
   still undesired because of customer perception. This leads to the
   question how sensitive analytical methods need to become for water
   quality screening, at what levels water suppliers need to take action
   and how effective treatment methods need to be designed to remove
   contaminants sufficiently. Therefore, in the Netherlands a clear and
   consistent approach called `Drinking Water Quality for the 21st century
   (Q21)' has been developed within the joint research program of the
   drinking water companies. Target values for anthropogenic drinking water
   contaminants were derived by using the recently introduced Threshold of
   Toxicological Concern (TTC) approach. The target values for individual
   genotoxic and steroid endocrine chemicals were set at 0.01 mu g/L. For
   all other organic chemicals the target values were set at 0.1 mu g/L.
   The target value for the total sum of genotoxic chemicals, the total sum
   of steroid hormones and the total sum of all other organic compounds
   were set at 0.01, 0.01 and 1.0 mu g/L, respectively. The Dutch Q21
   approach is further supplemented by the standstill-principle and
   effect-directed testing. The approach is helpful in defining the goals
   and limits of future treatment process designs and of analytical methods
   to further improve and ensure the quality of drinking water, without
   going to unnecessary extents. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of spatially distributed air temperature (Ta) is
   useful for a wide range of disciplines such as hydrology, meteorology
   and ecology. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land
   surface temperature (Ts) products hold the potential to get spatial
   estimates of land surface temperature at high temporal (daily) and
   spatial resolution (1 km) across the world. In this paper, the
   possibility of retrieving high-resolution Ta data from MODIS Ts data on
   both Terra and Aqua satellites was investigated over Xiangride River
   basin in the north Tibetan Plateau. The results of statistical analysis
   show that during the night MODIS Ts data on Terra satellite provides a
   good estimation of daily minimum air temperature with RMSE=2.97 degrees
   C, MAE=237 degrees C, and r=0.94, while during the day the difference
   between Terra MODIS Ts data and daily maximum air temperature is large
   with RMSE=7.45 degrees C, MAE=621 degrees C, and r=0.83. In order to
   improve the accuracy of the estimation of daily maximum air temperature,
   the temperature-vegetation index (TVX) method was used in this paper. By
   lowering the threshold for the negative correlation coefficient between
   NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and Ts to -0.1, the TVX
   method was applied to MODIS land products to estimate daily maximum air
   temperature successfully for the first time. The validation results show
   that the TVX method has improved the accuracy of daily maximum air
   temperature significantly with RMSE=3.79 degrees C, MAE=3.03 degrees C,
   and r=0.83. Finally, the diurnal air temperature variation was simulated
   using a simple sine curve model for the period 21:00-9:00 UCT. The
   simulation results were in good agreement with observed values with
   RMSE=3.43 degrees C, MAE=2.54 degrees C, and r=0.86. The results of this
   study show that daily maximum and minimum air temperature can be
   retrieved effectively from MODIS land surface products through the use
   of TVX method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   increased to 75\%. Deforestation rates varied in each year, but peaked
   in 2002 and declined since then. The combination of high-fidelity time
   series data and a robust method of change detection resulted in a
   virtual reconstruction of 11 years of drastic land change history of the
   delta's mangrove areas at a consistent spatiotemporal scale. We
   anticipate that the methodology developed in this study will be useful
   to reconstruct deforestation histories of other places as well. Also,
   our findings can potentially be used to further explore the
   socioeconomic drivers of mangrove deforestation so that reliable,
   appropriate and sustainable methods of local and regional scale
   adaptation/mitigation strategies can be developed. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Estimating heritability of traits in wild populations is a major
   prerequisite to understand their evolution. Until recently, most
   heritability estimates had been obtained using parent-offspring
   regressions. However, the popularity of animal models, that is,
   (generalized) linear mixed models assessing the genetic variance
   component based on population pedigree information, has markedly
   increased in the past few years. Animal models are claimed to perform
   better than parentoffspring regressions mainly because they use full
   between-individual relatedness information and they allow explicit
   modelling of the environmental effects shared by individuals. However,
   the differences between heritability estimates obtained using both
   approaches are not straight forward, and the factors influencing these
   differences remain unclear. We performed a simulation study to evaluate
   and compare the accuracy and precision of estimates obtained from
   parentoffspring regressions and animal models using both Frequentist
   (REML, PQL) and Bayesian (MCMC) estimation methods. We explored the
   influence of (i) the presence and type of shared environmental effects
   (non-transgenerational or transgenerational), (ii) the distribution of
   the phenotypic trait considered (Gaussian or binary trait) and (iii)
   data quantity and quality (sample size, pedigree connectivity) on
   heritability estimates obtained from the two approaches for different
   levels of true heritability. In the absence of shared environmental
   effects, the animal model using the REML method performed best for a
   Gaussian trait, while the animal model using MCMC was more appropriate
   for a binary trait. For low quantity and quality data, and a binary
   trait, the parentoffspring regression yielded very imprecise estimates.
   Estimates from the parentoffspring regression were not influenced by a
   non-transgenerational shared environmental effect, whereas estimates
   from animal models in which environmental effects are ignored were
   affected by both non-transgenerational and transgenerational effects. We
   discuss the relevance of each approach and estimation method for
   estimating heritability in wild populations. Importantly, because most
   effects fitted in animal models are, in fact, non-transgenerational
   (including environmental maternal effects), we advocate a systematic
   comparison between parentoffspring regression and animal model estimates
   to detect potentially missing non-transgenerational environmental
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{Non-monotonic (biphasic) dose-response relationships, known as hormetic
   relationships, have been observed across multiple experimental systems.
   Several models were proposed to describe non-monotonic relationships.
   However, few studies provided comprehensive description of hermetic
   quantities and their potential application. In this study, five biphasic
   models were used to fit five hormetic datasets from three different
   experimental systems of our lab. The bisection algorithm based on
   individual monotone functions was proposed to calculate arbitrary
   hormetic quantities instead of traditional methods (e.g., model
   reparameterization) which need complex mathematical manipulation.
   Results showed that all the five biphasic models could describe those
   datasets fairly well with coefficient of determination (R-adj(2))
   greater than 0.95 and root mean square error (RMSE) smaller than 0.10.
   The best-fit model could be selected based on R-adj(2), RMSE, and a
   supplemental criterion of Akaike information criterion (AIC). Hormetic
   quantities that trigger 10\% stimulation at the left (ECL10) and right
   (ECR10) side of stimulatory peak were calculated and emphasized for
   their implication in hormesis exploration for the first time.
   Furthermore, the ECL10, proposed as an alarm threshold for hormesis, was
   expected to be useful in risk assessment of environmental chemicals.
   This study lays a foundation in the quantitative description of the low
   dose hormetic effect and the investigation of hormesis in environmental
   risk assessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Question Does the abundance of keystone forest floor species change in
   response to changes in the forest structure? Location Sweden Methods We
   used data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory to investigate
   changes in the abundance of three common species, as well as the total
   abundance of all understorey vascular plants (the field layer) in
   forests in the boreal and temperate parts of Sweden. GLMs and GAMs were
   used to relate species abundance and temporal changes in abundances to
   forest structure and forest structural change. Results Productivity,
   measured as the site index, was the most important determinant of
   individual species' abundance. The volume of Picea abies, the density of
   tree stems and forest age were among the most important forest
   structural variables. We found that the dwarf shrub Vaccinium myrtillus,
   the narrow-leaved grasses (mainly Avenella flexuosa) and the total field
   layer cover decreased in boreal Sweden from 1994 through 2010 and that
   these changes coincided with an increase in forest density and with a
   reduction in forest age. Conclusions Changes in Swedish forests to
   higher tree layer density and younger age appear to contribute
   significantly to current changes in forest floor vegetation. The use of
   more intensive thinning practices to reduce the total density of the
   forest and to increase the proportion of broad-leaved tree species and
   Pinus sylvestris would favour the forest floor species in this study.
   Moreover, increasing forest age (i.e. the length of rotation periods)
   might favour V. myrtillus in particular, for which the time since
   disturbance is important for the recovery of pre-disturbance abundance.
   However, increased thinning intensity and forest age will reduce the
   potential for wood production, implying a trade-off between production
   of wood and maintenance of well-developed forest floor vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Setting up cost-efficient control programs for alien invasive species
   requires the development of adequate removal methods in combination with
   insights in population size and dynamics. American bullfrog Lithobates
   catesbeianus is an alien invasive species, which is suspected to cause
   substantial ecological damage around the globe. However, control of
   bullfrog populations is difficult, as no conclusive management measures
   have yet been determined. We investigated how double fyke nets could
   contribute to bullfrog management by assessing the tadpole population
   size in 10 permanent small shallow water bodies. Two population size
   estimate methods were applied, being the catch-depletion and
   mark-recapture method. Catchability of bullfrog tadpoles proved to be
   very consistent over ponds and methods, with one catch per unit of
   effort (one double fyke net for 24 h) retaining on average 6 \% of the
   tadpole population. Population density varied considerably among ponds,
   ranging from 950 to 120,804 larger tadpole individuals/ha. Using these
   insights in developing a cost-efficient eradication program for the
   species, we projected the number of catch efforts needed to reduce
   tadpole numbers to a threshold that more than likely affects final
   bullfrog population size. Predictions indicated that for the specified
   thresholds the use of eight double fyke nets at a time is most
   cost-efficient in high abundance populations, while using five double
   fyke nets seems most suitable in low abundance populations. What the
   exact threshold number of remaining tadpole individuals should be is
   uncertain, but forecasts demonstrate that only half of the budget would
   be needed when aiming at a drop to fewer than 100 remaining tadpoles
   than when a decrease to fewer than 10 remaining tadpoles is pursued.
   Given the fairly limited cost of bullfrog management with double fyke
   nets, however, it may be worthwhile to fully reduce the tadpole
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative analyses in landscape ecology have traditionally been
   dominated by the patch-mosaic concept in which landscapes are modeled as
   a mosaic of discrete patches. This model is useful for analyzing
   categorical data but cannot sufficiently account for the spatial
   heterogeneity present in continuous landscapes. Sub-pixel remote sensing
   classifications offer a potential data source for capturing continuous
   spatial heterogeneity but lack discrete land cover classes and therefore
   cannot be analyzed using standard landscape metric tools. This research
   introduces the threshold gradient method to allow transformation of
   continuous sub-pixel classifications into a series of discrete maps
   based on land cover proportion (i.e., intensity) that can be analyzed
   using landscape metric tools. Sub-pixel data are reclassified at
   multiple thresholds along a land cover continuum and landscape metrics
   are computed for each map. Metrics are plotted in response to intensity
   and these `scalograms' are mathematically modeled using curve fitting
   techniques to allow determination of critical land cover thresholds (e.
   g., inflection points) where considerable landscape changes are
   occurring. Results show that critical land cover intensities vary
   between metrics, and the approach can generate increased ecological

Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{224}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Major incidents involving mine waste facilities and poor environmental
   management practices have left the legacy of thousands of contaminated
   sites like in the historic mining areas in the Carpathian Basin.
   Associated environmental risks have triggered the development of new EU
   environmental legislation to prevent and minimize the effects of such
   incidents. The Mine Waste Directive requires the risk-based inventory of
   all mine waste sites in Europe by May 2012. In order to address the
   mining environmental problems, a standard risk-based pre-selection
   protocol has been developed by the EU Commission. The protocol consists
   of 18 simple questions about contamination source, pathway and receptor.
   This paper evaluates the protocol by applying it to real-life cases,
   adopting it to local conditions, comparing to the similar method of the
   European Environmental Agency standard Preliminary Risk Assessment Model
   (PRAMS) and by carrying out uncertainty analysis. All together, 145 ore
   mine waste sites have been selected for scientific testing and
   evaluation using the EU Mining Waste Directive (MWD) Pre-selection
   Protocol as a case study from Hungary. The proportion of uncertain
   responses to questions in the protocol for the mine waste site gives an
   insight of specific and overall uncertainty in the data used. Questions
   of the EU MWD Pre-selection Protocol are linked to a GIS system, and key
   parameters such as the topographic slope and distance to the nearest
   surface and groundwater bodies to settlements and protected areas are
   calculated and statistically evaluated in order to adjust the RA models
   to local conditions in Hungary. Results show that the adjustment of
   threshold values to local conditions is necessary; however, the EU MWD
   Pre-selection Protocol is robust and is relatively insensitive to
   threshold values. Results of the EU MWD Preselection Protocol are
   consistent with the pre-screening European Environmental Agency PRAMS
   model which further confirms that the Protocol delivers reliable
   selection results that are not sensitive to the selected parameters. An
   interesting outcome of the study is that the highest uncertainty is
   associated with the engineering conditions of the waste facilities, such
   as the heights and size.}},

Abstract = {{The development of camera-traps has provided an opportunity to study
   ecological relationships and population dynamics of species that are
   rare, difficult to observe or capture. Their use has seen a major
   increase recently, particularly with the recent progress in methods
   adapted to species for which individuals cannot be identified. We took
   advantage of extensive camera-trap data sets from large
   spatiotemporal-scale studies of a diverse assemblage of avian and
   mammalian scavengers in subarctic/arctic tundra to determine sampling
   designs that minimize detection errors (false-negative) and to evaluate
   the influence of sampling design on estimation of site occupancy.
   Results showed that raw error rates in daily presence varied between 5
   and 30\% among species when using time-triggered cameras with a 5-min
   interval. Using movement-triggered cameras resulted in larger raw error
   rates, between 30 and 70\%, as well as a lower number of daily presences
   detected. Increasing the time interval from 5 to 20min greatly increased
   the raw error rate in daily presence, but it had negligible impacts on
   estimates and precision of occupancy and detection probability.
   Occupancy estimates were mostly influenced by variation in the number of
   days included during the sampling period. For most species, a threshold
   of between 20 and 30 problem-free days (i.e. without camera-related
   technical problems) was required to stabilize occupancy and detection
   probability, as well as to maximize their precision. Based on the
   results, we discuss guidelines for establishing sampling designs
   according to the different ecological questions researchers might want
   to answer. To our knowledge, our study is the first to directly test the
   influence of sampling design in camera-trap studies, providing
   guidelines that are likely to be directly applicable to a large range of

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal changes in climatic extremes in the Yellow River Basin
   from 1959 to 2008 were investigated on the basis of a suite of 27
   climatic indices derived from daily temperature and precipitation data
   from 75 meteorological stations with the help of the Mann-Kendall test,
   linear regression method and GIS technique. Furthermore, the changes in
   the probability distribution of the extreme indices were examined. The
   results indicate: (1) The whole basin is dominated by significant
   increase in the frequency of warm days and warm nights, and dominated by
   significant decrease in the frequency of cold days and cold nights.
   Although trends in absolute temperature indices show less spatial
   coherence compared with that in the percentile-based temperature
   indices, overall increasing trends can be found in Max Tmax (TXx), Min
   Tmax (TXn), Max Tmin (TNx) and Min Tmin (TNn). (2) Although the spatial
   patterns and the number of stations with significant changes for
   threshold and duration temperature indices are also not identical,
   general positive trends in warm indices (i.e., summer days (SU25),
   tropical nights (TR20), warm spell duration indicator and growing season
   length) and negative trends in cold indices (i.e., frost days, ice days
   and cold spell duration indicator) can be found in the basin. Annual
   nighttime temperature has increased at a faster rate than that in
   daytime temperature, leading to obvious decrease in diurnal temperature
   range. (3) The changes in precipitation indices are much weaker and less
   spatially coherent compared with these of temperature indices. For all
   precipitation indices, only few stations are characterized by
   significantly change in extreme precipitation, and their spatial
   patterns are always characterized by irregular and insignificant
   positive and negative changes. However, generally, changes in
   precipitation extremes present drying trends, although most of the
   changes are insignificant. (4) Results at seasonal scale show that
   warming trends occur for all seasons, particularly in winter. Different
   from that in other three seasons, general positive trends in max 1-day
   precipitation (Rx1DAY) and max 5-day precipitation (Rx5DAY) are found in
   winter. Analysis of changes in probability distributions of indices for
   1959-1983 and 1984-2008 indicate a remarkable shift toward warmer
   condition and a less pronounced tendency toward drier condition during
   the past decades. The results can provide beneficial reference to water
   resource and eco-environment management strategies in the Yellow River
   Basin for associated policymakers and stakeholders.}},

Title = {{Incorporating Uncertainty of Management Costs in Sensitivity Analyses of

Abstract = {{The importance of accounting for economic costs when making
   environmental-management decisions subject to resource constraints has
   been increasingly recognized in recent years. In contrast, uncertainty
   associated with such costs has often been ignored. We developed a
   method, on the basis of economic theory, that accounts for the
   uncertainty in population-management decisions. We considered the case
   where, rather than taking fixed values, model parameters are random
   variables that represent the situation when parameters are not precisely
   known. Hence, the outcome is not precisely known either. Instead of
   maximizing the expected outcome, we maximized the probability of
   obtaining an outcome above a threshold of acceptability. We derived
   explicit analytical expressions for the optimal allocation and its
   associated probability, as a function of the threshold of acceptability,
   where the model parameters were distributed according to normal and
   uniform distributions. To illustrate our approach we revisited a
   previous study that incorporated cost-efficiency analyses in management
   decisions that were based on perturbation analyses of matrix population
   models. Incorporating derivations from this study into our framework, we
   extended the model to address potential uncertainties. We then applied
   these results to 2 case studies: management of a Koala (Phascolarctos
   cinereus) population and conservation of an olive ridley sea turtle
   (Lepidochelys olivacea) population. For low aspirations, that is, when
   the threshold of acceptability is relatively low, the optimal strategy
   was obtained by diversifying the allocation of funds. Conversely, for
   high aspirations, the budget was directed toward management actions with
   the highest potential effect on the population. The exact optimal
   allocation was sensitive to the choice of uncertainty model. Our results
   highlight the importance of accounting for uncertainty when making
   decisions and suggest that more effort should be placed on understanding
   the distributional characteristics of such uncertainty. Our approach
   provides a tool to improve decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed and reliable information about the spatial distribution of
   species provides critical information for effective conservation
   planning. In Victoria, Australia, this responsibility is held by the
   Department of Sustainability and Environment, which maintains and
   curates a database of site records for species: the Victorian
   Biodiversity Atlas. But the information is provided in point form, and
   therefore, it does not provide an adequate view of species distributions
   for all management purposes. By integrating known occurrences of species
   with environmental GIS data layers using a machine learning algorithm,
   random forest, we have built species distribution models for 523
   vertebrate fauna species across the whole state, providing predictive
   `maps' that are available for use in various conservation planning
   activities. In this paper, we introduce and discuss the methods we
   developed and implemented for producing these models. Specifically, 26
   explanatory variables were used for the modelling; three versions of
   models were built using different sets of explanatory variables;
   pseudo-absences were chosen by filtering random points with a profile
   model; model accuracy was assessed using several measures, especially
   lift curve-related ones; a threshold was selected for each model to
   transform continuous result to binary one by maximizing the sum of
   sensitivity and (pseudo) specificity, which was proved to be valid for

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{470-475}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{At public beaches, it is now common to mitigate the impact of
   water-borne pathogens by posting a swimmer's advisory when the
   concentration of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) exceeds an action
   threshold. Since culturing the bacteria delays public notification when
   dangerous conditions exist, regression models are sometimes used to
   predict the FIB concentration based on readily-available environmental
   measurements. It is hard to know which environmental parameters are
   relevant to predicting FIB concentration, and the parameters are usually
   correlated, which can hurt the predictive power of a regression model.
   Here the method of partial least squares (PLS) is introduced to automate
   the regression modeling process. Model selection is reduced to the
   process of setting a tuning parameter to control the decision threshold
   that separates predicted exceedances of the standard from predicted
   non-exceedances. The method is validated by application to four Great
   Lakes beaches during the summer of 2010. Performance of the PLS models
   compares favorably to that of the existing state-of-the-art regression

Title = {{Chemicals Alternatives Assessment (CAA): Tools for Selecting Less
   Hazardous Chemicals}},
Booktitle = {{CHEMICAL ALTERNATIVES ASSESSMENTS}},
Series = {{Issues in Environmental Science and Technology Series}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{1-43}},
Abstract = {{Chemicals alternatives assessment (CAA) is a form of alternatives
   assessment that focuses on finding alternative chemicals, materials or
   product designs to substitute for the use of hazardous chemicals.
   Chemical hazard assessment (CHA) or comparative CHA is a method for
   comparing chemicals based on their inherent hazard properties. CAA is
   inclusive of CHA. However, a comprehensive CAA can be much broader and
   include information such as cost, availability, performance and social
   and environmental life-cycle attributes. CHA/CAA provides users with
   hazard-based information to make informed decisions when selecting less
   hazardous chemical alternatives. There are multiple CAA methods in use
   around the world and these methods share a common goal, namely, to
   support the intelligent design, use and substitution of chemicals to
   benefit humankind in a manner that will not harm our environment and its
   inhabitants. Ideally, a CAA/CHA will completely characterize a
   chemical's intrinsic human health and environmental hazards, in the
   process promoting the selection of less hazardous chemical ingredients,
   in addition to avoiding unintended consequences of switching to a poorly
   characterized chemical substitute.
   CHA methods typically share common hazard endpoints related to human
   toxicity, environmental toxicity and environmental fate. The endpoints
   are evaluated based on criteria that allow for the use of measured or
   predicted data. Human health criteria in CHA evaluate endpoints such as
   potential carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, reproductive and developmental
   toxicity, endocrine disruption, acute and chronic or repeat dose
   toxicity, dermal and eye irritation and dermal and respiratory
   sensitization. Acute and chronic aquatic toxicity, terrestrial toxicity,
   persistence and bioaccumulation are commonly evaluated to predict a
   chemical's environmental toxicity and fate. Finally, some CHAs (such as
   GreenScreen (TM)) also evaluate a chemical's physical characteristics
   such as flammability and reactivity.
   Of the CAA methods listed, only the US Environmental Protection Agency
   (EPA)'s DfE program, CPA's GreenScreen (TM) and MBDC's Cradle to Cradle
   (R) paradigms are fully transparent and publicly available methods of
   assessment. Most other CAAs in use around the world do not fully
   disclose all of their reasoning or resources used for establishing
   threshold values for hazard criteria, prioritization of hazard endpoints
   and life-cycle concerns. Some CAA methods are limited to a focus on CHA
   whereas others such as MBDC's Cradle to Cradle (R) expand the focus to
   consider some life-cycle attributes. Whether the CAA method includes
   additional attributes or not, CHA can be used in a modular way,
   combining with other needed information to inform decision-making.
   CAA provides a powerful means to improve upon the status quo by
   establishing methods to inform chemical substitution in a scientifically
   rigorous and defensible manner. Recognizing the value of CAA and
   fostering greater adoption of CAA methods provide stakeholders with
   much-needed tools to address a serious deficiency in the way in which
   chemicals are used in society, as maintaining the status quo is
   analogous to giving up. As humankind's understanding of the full costs
   and benefits of chemicals matures, it is critical that we cease using
   those chemicals that can permanently impair human health or the
   environment.}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The paper discusses the concept, methods and application of the Crisis
   Probability Curves (CPCs) to assess vulnerability to droughts in
   selected regions in India, Portugal, and Russia using published data on
   susceptibility and water stress indices. The CPCs, which are estimated
   from regression models and represented in a diagram as contour plots,
   are a spatiotemporal vulnerability yardstick that estimates
   vulnerability levels and thresholds to the combined impacts of
   environmental stress and human susceptibility (or lack of adaptive
   capacity). As compared to the CPCs for Russia, those for India and
   Portugal tilt more towards the water stress axis. This implies that the
   level of vulnerability in the latter countries tends to be more
   sensitive to the changes in water stress level than socio-economic
   susceptibility. For a particular water stress level, however, the
   probability of crisis occurring in India is higher than in Portugal.
   India has thus the lowest vulnerability threshold. Using pooled and
   panel regression, the information for three case study regions was
   combined to develop a common measure of vulnerability thresholds.
   Building common or generic thresholds will allow comparison of
   vulnerability, across regions, which can be useful for policy in terms
   of developing priority list for providing adaptation support in
   vulnerable regions. However, the results revealed that there is a risk
   of under- or overestimating vulnerability thresholds when comparing
   regions not only. with different level, but also varying sources of
   vulnerability Thus, more crucial than developing generic vulnerability
   thresholds is highlighting differential vulnerability through selection
   of appropriate susceptibility indicators.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{To better understand how resource availability controls estuarine
   microbial communities, we compared community composition at 2 sites in
   the tidal freshwater James River (Virginia, USA) which differed in
   nutrient concentrations and autochthonous production. In addition, we
   conducted laboratory microcosm experiments, wherein bacteria from the 2
   sites received nutrient, light, and organic carbon amendments.
   Traditional, microscopy-based methods of staining and enumeration were
   used to determine the abundance of total, live, and active cells. DNA
   fingerprinting (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism,
   TRFLP) and dual 16S rDNA-rRNA pyrosequencing were used to assess
   community composition and taxon-specific activity (from rRNA: rDNA).
   Enumeration revealed that total, live, and active (CTC+) bacteria were
   more abundant at the site where autochthonous production was higher,
   while DNA fingerprinting (TRFLP) and 16S rDNA pyrosequencing indicated
   high similarity in community composition at the 2 sites. In contrast,
   pyrosequencing results from rRNA revealed greater variation and suggest
   that the metabolically active fraction of the community differed between
   sites. Differences in rDNA- and rRNA-based libraries were also apparent
   in microcosm experiments, where resource amendments resulted in shifts
   in both the active and overall communities. In both environmental and
   microcosm samples, dual rDNA-rRNA pyrosequencing yielded higher
   estimates of the proportion of active cells (32 +/- 3\%) compared to
   differential staining and microscopy (13 +/- 1\%). Though
   characterization of active taxa was sensitive to the presumed activity
   threshold (rRNA:rDNA), our findings suggest that variable resource
   conditions can give rise to unique assemblages of active taxa despite
   similarities in overall community composition.}},

Abstract = {{There is not any standardization of when or how guidelines are applied

   This manuscript describes the results of a battery of toxicity tests
   (bacteria, algae and sea urchins) carried out on sediment elutriates
   from multiple environmental sampling sites (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy), and
   compares different frameworks for integration of the data. The objective
   was to determine the most appropriate of three data integration
   strategies for sediment ecotoxicological assessment: a) Worst Case, b)
   Qualitative Assessment, and c) Quantitative Assessment.
   The Worst Case considers the highest toxic effect, independently from
   numbers and types of tests carried out, typology of the test matrix, and
   endpoint. The Qualitative Assessment classifies the sediment toxicity
   considering only the number of significant toxic effects. The
   Quantitative Assessment takes into account several macro-descriptors,
   such as the type of endpoints and the relevance of the environmental
   matrices.
   We observed that: a) Worst Case and Qualitative Assessment do not give
   any details about the tests; b) the Qualitative Assessment often
   underestimates the toxic. effects; c) the Quantitative Assessment
   provides a number easy to read as the Worst Case but taking into
   consideration several factors that the Worst Case does not cover.}},

Abstract = {{Management of marine and estuarine fish and shellfish would benefit from
   a numerical approach that quantifies the impacts of climate variability

   Using temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, habitat volumes were
   calculated based on threshold physiological tolerances (fixed criteria)
   and potential growth (bioenergetics) for Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser
   oxyrinchus. Simulations from a coupled oxygen and hydrodynamic model of
   the Chesapeake Bay, USA, were used to estimate habitat volumes of
   juvenile sturgeon and assess the sensitivity of habitat to environmental
   factors. In winter, salinity controlled the required (needed for
   survival) and optimal (needed for highest growth) habitat. Temperature
   and salinity defined spring and autumn optimal habitat, and a
   combination of salinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen influenced
   habitat volumes during summer. Although average summertime oxygen
   limitation reduced the volumes of juvenile habitat by 3.3-28.0\%, the
   largest reductions in summertime habitat resulted from temperature
   limitation. The average difference in annual and seasonal volumes
   between fixed-criteria and bioenergetics methods was approximately 14\%,
   with similar trends over the annual cycle for most life stages and
   habitat types. We conclude that fixed-criteria habitat volume models

   the main existing methods to estimate nitrogen needs are examined for
   their accuracy, specificity and sensitivity based on research conducted

   leaf chlorophyll fluorescence readings with handheld fluorimeters, and
   the measurement of crop light reflectance with a handheld radiometer
   (ground-based remote sensing) or with satellite imagery (spatial remote
   sensing). Conditions for implementing such methods within decision
   support systems are briefly described, by focusing on the need to use
   relative values rather than raw values taken from the readings, and also
   on the requirement for threshold value definition. The integration of
   crop nitrogen status values into N fertilization recommendation models

Pages = {{1764-1772}},
Abstract = {{Acid mine drainage (AMD) has degraded water quality and ecology in
   streams on the Stockton Plateau, the site of New Zealand's largest
   open-cast coal mining operation. This has previously been attributed
   largely to the effects of acidity and elevated aluminium (Al)
   concentrations. However, the toxicity of dissolved Al is dependent on
   speciation, which is influenced by pH which affects Al hydrolysis, as
   well as the concentrations of organic carbon and sulphate which complex
   Al. Methods for the assessment of the toxic fraction of Al, by chemical
   analysis and geochemical modelling, have been investigated in selected
   streams on the Stockton Plateau, where dissolved Al concentrations
   ranged from 0.034 to 27 mg L-1. Modelling using PHREEQC indicated that
   between 0.2 and 85\% of the dissolved Al was present as the free ion
   Al3+, the most toxic Al species, which dominated in waters of pH =
   3.8-4.8. Al-sulphate complexation reduced the Al3+ concentration at
   lower pH, while Al-organic and -hydroxide complexes dominated at higher
   pH. Macroinvertebrate richness in the streams identified an Al3+
   `threshold' of approximately 0.42 mg/L, above which taxa declined
   rapidly. Colorimetric `Aluminon' analysis on unpreserved, unfiltered
   waters provided a better estimation of Al3+ concentrations than
   inductively couple plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) on filtered,
   acidified waters. The Aluminon method does not react with particulate Al
   or strong Al complexes, often registering as little as 53\% of the
   dissolved Al concentration determined by ICP-MS.}},

Abstract = {{Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables,
   usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any
   descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter
   estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and
   hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant
   predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when
   a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to
   another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To
   demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show
   how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over
   spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different
   approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed,
   ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection,
   through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using
   simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing
   complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address
   collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning
   approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its
   impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the
   methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a
   training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance
   on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods
   specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods
   and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and
   threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in
   combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and
   threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in
   the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded
   degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the folk
   lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables
   of |r| >0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to
   severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of
   ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable
   selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches
   reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of diverse native plant communities typically requires the
   collection of large amounts of seed. Thus, practitioners often struggle
   to find adequate supplies near project sites and need to know from how
   far they can collect without compromising restoration successhow far
   does local provenance extend? We addressed this issue by assessing
   genetic variation within, and differentiation among, 12 potential seed
   source populations of Persoonia longifolia, a key component of the
   jarrah forest of Western Australia. An analysis of molecular variance of
   66 polymorphic amplified fragment length polymorphism markers
   partitioned 92\% of the total genetic variation within populations and
   8\% among populations, indicating relatively weak but statistically
   significant population genetic differentiation. Ordination of these
   genetic data showed marked west/east and north/south gradients. Pairwise
   population genetic dissimilarity was correlated with both geographic
   distance and environmental distance derived from five climate variables.
   However, partial Mantel tests showed that the relationship between
   genetic and geographic distance was not independent of environmental
   distance, suggesting a non-neutral signature in these markers. Bayesian
   outlier analysis identified two markers, and spatial analysis method
   tests identified highly significant associations between these two
   markers and three environmental variables. Frequency differences at
   these markers across populations suggested the possibility of
   climatically adapted provenances. The global significance value from
   analyses of similarities for these two markers correlated to a general
   provenance distance of 47 km, in contrast to a threshold of 60 km for
   the complete dataset. Guidelines for seed sourcing that consider these
   population genetic data should lead to more effective ecological
   restoration with this species.}},

Abstract = {{Question Fire management practices aimed at biodiversity conservation
   are often in conflict with hazard reduction requirements. Particularly
   in protected areas where such conflict of interest exists, the question
   is asked: what are the ecological thresholds within which fire should be
   managed? Location Montane proteoid fynbos shrublands, eastern coastal
   part of the Cape Floral Kingdom; coastal slopes of the Tsitsikamma and
   Outeniqua Mountains, South Africa. Methods Estimates of optimal fire
   frequencies are often based on the relationship between plant age and
   the rate of seed accumulation of the slowest-maturing species. We
   established juvenile periods and recruitment success (measured as the
   ratio of post-fire recruits to the pre-burn population) after fires at
   different intervals, of serotinous, reseeding shrubs in the Proteaceae.
   From this we estimated minimum fire return intervals (FRIs) that would
   allow for their persistence in eastern coastal fynbos shrublands.
   Results Juvenile periods ranged from 4 to 9 yr, which are comparable to
   ecologically similar proteoids elsewhere in fynbos and SE and SW
   Australian shrublands. There was large variability among sites and
   within species in the degree of flowering at given plant ages, some of
   which seemed related to the moisture regime. There were no consistent
   differences among species in their rate of maturation. Post-fire
   recruitment success was near zero following a fire in 5-yr-old
   vegetation, always above replacement levels following fires in =7-yr-old
   vegetation, and at a maximum in old (38 yr) fynbos. There was
   considerable variation in post-fire recruitment success for any
   particular FRI, species or site. The lack of a significant relationship
   between recruitment success and pre-fire vegetation age, suggests that
   once a critical post-fire age is attained, factors other than seed
   abundance affect recruitment success. Conclusions From an ecological
   perspective, our findings imply a minimum FRI of 9 yr for eastern
   coastal fynbos. This is not intended to prescribe rigid management of
   fire according to a fixed rotation and does not negate the need to
   consider site- or species-specific requirements. Instead it provides a
   lower threshold for a range of acceptable FRIs below which a significant

Abstract = {{High-throughput sequencing techniques have made large-scale spatial and
   temporal surveys of microbial communities routine. Gaining insight into
   microbial diversity requires methods for effectively analyzing and
   visualizing these extensive data sets. Phylogenetic beta-diversity
   measures address this challenge by allowing the relationship between
   large numbers of environmental samples to be explored using standard
   multivariate analysis techniques. Despite the success and widespread use
   of phylogenetic beta-diversity measures, an extensive comparative
   analysis of these measures has not been performed. Here, we compare 39
   measures of phylogenetic beta diversity in order to establish the
   relative similarity of these measures along with key properties and
   performance characteristics. While many measures are highly correlated,
   those commonly used within microbial ecology were found to be distinct
   from those popular within classical ecology, and from the recently
   recommended Gower and Canberra measures. Many of the measures are
   surprisingly robust to different rootings of the gene tree, the choice
   of similarity threshold used to define operational taxonomic units, and
   the presence of outlying basal lineages. Measures differ considerably in
   their sensitivity to rare organisms, and the effectiveness of measures
   can vary substantially under alternative models of differentiation.
   Consequently, the depth of sequencing required to reveal underlying
   patterns of relationships between environmental samples depends on the
   selected measure. Our results demonstrate that using complementary
   measures of phylogenetic beta diversity can further our understanding of

Abstract = {{Questions How can we understand the limitations to plant growth at high
   altitudes? Our aim was to test the hypotheses that for alpine grasslands
   along a large altitudinal gradient in semi-arid regions, plant growth is
   mainly limited by drought at low altitudes but by low temperature at
   high altitudes, resulting in a unimodal pattern of biomass and
   productivity associated with an optimal combination of temperature and
   precipitation. Such knowledge is important to understanding the response
   of alpine ecosystems to climate change.
   Location We conducted a 5-yr livestock exclosure experiment along the
   south-facing slope of the Nyaiqentanglha Mountains, central Tibetan
   Plateau.
   Methods We measured above- and below-ground biomass, species richness,
   leaf d13C and water potential, and related climate and soil variables
   across 42 fenced and unfenced quadrats near seven HOBO weather stations
   along the slope. The vegetation changed from alpine steppe-meadow at
   43904500 m to alpine meadow at 46005210 m.
   Results Total above- and below-ground biomass across fenced and unfenced
   quadrats increased with increasing altitude up to 49505100 m, and then
   decreased above 5100 m. Altitudinal trends in leaf d13C and water
   potential of dominant species also showed a unimodal pattern
   corresponding to that of vegetation biomass. Total above- and
   below-ground biomass as well as sedge above-ground biomass all showed a
   quadratic relationship with mean temperatures and the ratio of growing
   season precipitation (GSP) to =5 degrees C accumulated temperature
   (AccT; R2 = 0.83-0.88, P < 0.001). In general, above- and below-ground
   biomass increased with increasing water availability when the GSP/AccT
   ratio was lower than the threshold level of 0.800.84, but decreased when
   the GSP/AccT ratio was higher than this threshold level. No significant
   relationship was found between residuals of above-ground biomass and
   species richness after removing the effects of climate factors on both
   stand variables.
   Conclusions The results support our hypotheses, further suggesting a
   threshold of water limitation that is consistent with the model
   prediction over the Tibetan Plateau. Species richness per se appears to
   weakly affect community-level productivity. The response of alpine
   grasslands to climate warming may vary with altitude because of
   altitudinal shifts in factors limiting plant growth.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of an ecosystem sustainable management is to preserve
   its capacity to respond and adapt to current disturbances and/or future
   changes, and maintain the provision of environmental goods and services.
   Two very important properties linked to this objective are the ecosystem
   resilience and resistance to disturbance factors. The
   Structural-Functional State and Transition Model (SFSTM) is a conceptual
   framework that allows evaluating the ecosystem resilience and resistance
   based on structural and functional attributes. On the other hand, the
   Landscape Functional Analysis (LFA) presents a method to assess the
   rangeland ``health{''} based on structural vegetation and soil
   indicators, creating indexes to evaluate the ecosystem functional
   integrity. The aim of this study is to integrate LFA and SFSTM as an
   approach to help validate indicators and indexes associated with the
   resistance, resilience, and stability of a temperate rangeland
   ecosystem. States and transitions model for a shrubby-grasses steppe of
   the Western Patagonian District was used as a reference system. Changes
   in vegetation structure, soil surface, and loss of soil due to erosion
   were determined in sites with different grazing histories. Based on the
   SFSTM, we assessed the relationships between ecosystem structural
   changes with the recruitment process of the plant community and
   ecosystem integrity indexes (sensu LFA). Our results indicate that the
   decrease in the recruitment process, related to different grazing
   histories, was associated with a loss of ecosystem functional integrity.
   This was associated to a decrease in the ability to retain, store, and
   use rain water, and also in nutrient cycling. This suggests that the
   integration of the LFA methodology to the SFSTM can be used for indexes
   validation, which in turn allows the identification of critical
   thresholds associated with ecosystem resilience loss. Finally,
   throughout the integration of indicators of LFA into SFSTM, we
   established relationships between ecosystem resistance, resilience, and
   stability in response to a disturbance factor (e.g. overgrazing). Thus,
   we used this information to define states in stable, unstable,
   mixed-unstable, and indifferent-stable dynamic equilibriums. Our
   proposed approach provides a tool for ecosystem assessment regarding the
   identification of states that can be restored and those that might be
   more susceptible to degradation. Such information might help in the
   prevention of crossing a critical threshold and be used for sustainable
   management programs in rangelands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: A multi-faceted approach was used to investigate the
   wintertime ecophysiology and behavioral patterns of the raccoon dog,
   Nyctereutes procyonoides, a suitable model for winter sleep studies. By
   utilizing GPS tracking, activity sensors, body temperature (T-b)
   recordings, change-point analysis (CPA), home range, habitat and dietary
   analyses, as well as fatty acid signatures (FAS), the impact of the
   species on wintertime food webs was assessed. The timing of passive
   bouts was determined with multiple methods and compared to T-b data
   analyzed by CPA.
   Results: Raccoon dogs displayed wintertime mobility, and the home range
   sizes determined by GPS were similar or larger than previous estimates
   by radio tracking. The preferred habitats were gardens, shores,
   deciduous forests, and sparsely forested areas. Fields had close to
   neutral preference; roads and railroads were utilized as travel routes.
   Raccoon dogs participated actively in the food web and gained benefit
   from human activity. Mammals, plants, birds, and discarded fish
   comprised the most important dietary classes, and the consumption of
   fish could be detected in FAS. Ambient temperature was an important
   external factor influencing Tb and activity. The timing of passive
   periods approximated by behavioral data and by CPA shared 91\%
   similarity.
   Conclusions: Passive periods can be determined with CPA from Tb
   recordings without the previously used time-consuming and expensive
   methods. It would be possible to recruit more animals by using the
   simple methods of data loggers and ear tags. Hunting could be used as a
   tool to return the ear-tagged individuals allowing the economical
   extension of follow-up studies. The Tb and CPA methods could be applied
   to other northern carnivores.}},

Abstract = {{In many regions of the world, variable retention has replaced
   clear-cutlogging as the principal method of regeneration harvest.
   Partial retention of the overstory is thought to ensure greater
   continuity of the species and ecological processes that characterize
   older forests. Level (amount) and spatial pattern of overstory retention
   are two basic elements of forest structure that can be manipulated to
   achieve specific ecological or silvicultural objectives. However,
   experiments that elucidate the relative importance of retention level
   and pattern (or their interaction) are rare. Here we assess long-term
   (>10 yr) responses of forest understories to experimental harvests of
   mature coniferous forests replicated at five sites in the Pacific
   Northwest (PNW). Treatments contrast both the level of retention (40\%
   vs. 15\% of original basal area) and its spatial distribution (dispersed
   vs. aggregated in 1-ha patches). For most vascular plant groups (early
   seral, forest generalist, and late seral), postharvest changes in cover
   and richness were reduced at higher levels of retention and in dispersed
   relative to aggregated treatments. Although retained forest patches were
   stable, changes in adjacent harvested (cleared) areas were significantly
   greater than in dispersed treatments. Late-seral herbs were highly
   sensitive to level and pattern of retention, with extirpations most
   frequent in the cleared areas of aggregated treatments and at low levels
   of dispersed retention. In contrast, early-seral species were most
   abundant in these environments. Forest-floor bryophytes exhibited large
   and persistent declines regardless of treatment, suggesting that
   threshold levels of disturbance or stress were exceeded. Our results
   indicate that 15\% retention (the minimum standard on federal
   forestlands in the PNW) is insufficient to retain the abundance or
   diversity of species characteristic of late-seral forests. Although 1-ha
   aggregates provide refugia, they are susceptible to edge effects or
   stochastic processes; thus, smaller aggregates are unlikely to serve
   this function. The ability to achieve multiple ecological or
   silvicultural objectives with variable retention will require the
   spatial partitioning of habitats to include dispersed retention and
   larger undisturbed aggregates along with cleared areas.}},

   North America. Methods Using Little's tree range maps, we tested four
   hypothetical shapes of response relating occupancy to climate: (1) high
   occupancy of all suitable climates; (2) threshold response (i.e.
   unsuitable climates exclude species, but within the thresholds, species
   presence is independent of climate); (3) occupancy is a bivariate normal
   function of annual temperature and precipitation; and (4) asymmetric
   limitation (i.e. abiotic factors set abrupt range limits in stressful
   climates only). Finally, we compared observed climatic niches with the
   occupancy of similar climates on off-shore islands as well as west of
   the Rockies. Results (a) Species' distributions in climatic space do not
   have strong thresholds, nor are they systematically skewed towards less
   stressful climates. (b) Occupancy can generally be described by a
   bivariate normal function of temperature and precipitation, with little
   or no interaction between the two variables. This model, averaged over
   all species, accounts for 82\% of the spatial variation in the
   probability of occupancy of a given area. (c) Occupied geographic ranges

Abstract = {{The small-island effect (SIE), i.e. the hypothesis that species richness
   on islands below a certain threshold area varies independently of area,
   has become more and more part of the theoretical framework of
   biogeography and biodiversity research. However, existing SIE studies
   are extraordinarily biased taxonomically: plants and other animal
   taxonomic groups are predominantly studied, while birds are almost
   completely overlooked. Furthermore, previous methods for the detection
   of SIE are flawed in one or another way, including not accounting for
   model complexity, not comparing all relevant models, not including
   islands with no species, and ignoring the effects of logarithmic data
   transformations and habitat diversity in generating SIE. Therefore, the
   existence and the prevalence of the SIE may be dubious. In this study,

   2011. We used three broad sets of analyses, regression-based analyses,
   path analyses and null model analyses, to overcome potential
   methodological problems in detecting the SIE. We found no evidence for
   an SIE in avian communities in the Thousand Island Lake. Model selection
   based on AICc identified the simple power model without SIE as the most
   parsimonious model. In contrast, there was little support for the three
   breakpoint regression models with SIE. Path analyses and null model
   analyses also did not detect an SIE. We conclude that, for the robust
   detection of SIE, future study should carefully take all these
   methodological pitfalls into account.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal and estuarine waters are the site of intense anthropogenic
   influence with concomitant use for recreation and seafood harvesting.
   Therefore, coastal and estuarine water quality has a direct impact on
   human health. In eastern North Carolina (NC) there are over 240
   recreational and 1025 shellfish harvesting water quality monitoring
   sites that are regularly assessed. Because of the large number of sites,
   sampling frequency is often only on a weekly basis. This frequency,
   along with an 18-24 h incubation time for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB)
   enumeration via culture-based methods, reduces the efficiency of the
   public notification process. In states like NC where beach monitoring
   resources are limited but historical data are plentiful, predictive
   models may offer an improvement for monitoring and notification by
   providing real-time FIB estimates. In this study, water samples were
   collected during 12 thy (n = 88) and 13 wet (n = 66) weather events at
   up to 10 sites. Statistical predictive models for Escherichia coli (EC),
   enterococci (ENT), and members of the Bacteroidales group were created
   and subsequently validated. Our results showed that models for EC and
   ENT (adjusted R-2 were 0.61 and 0.64, respectively) incorporated a range
   of antecedent rainfall, climate, and environmental variables. The most
   important variables for EC and ENT models were 5-day antecedent
   rainfall, dissolved oxygen, and salinity. These models successfully
   predicted FIB levels over a wide range of conditions with a 3\% (EC
   model) and 9\% (ENT model) overall error rate for recreational threshold
   values and a 0\% (EC model) overall error rate for shellfish threshold
   values. Though modeling of members of the Bacteroidales group had less
   predictive ability (adjusted R-2 were 0.56 and 0.53 for fecal
   Bacteroides spp. and human Bacteroides spp., respectively), the modeling
   approach and testing provided information on Bacteroidales ecology. This
   is the first example of a set of successful statistical predictive
   models appropriate for assessment of both recreational and shellfish
   harvesting water quality in estuarine waters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method for the detection
   of enterococci fecal indicator bacteria has been shown to be generally
   applicable for the analysis of temperate fresh (Great Lakes) and marine
   coastal waters and for providing risk-based determinations of water
   quality at recreational beaches. In this study we further examined the
   applicability of the method for analyses of diverse inland waters as
   well as tropical marine waters from Puerto Rico based on the frequencies
   of samples showing presumptive PCR interference. Interference was
   assessed by salmon DNA sample processing control (SPC) and internal
   amplification control (IAC) assay analysis results and pre-established
   acceptance criteria of <3.0 and <1.5 cycle threshold (Ct) offsets from
   control samples, respectively. SPC assay results were accepted in
   analyses of 93\% of the inland water samples whereas the criterion was
   met at frequencies of 60\% and 97\% in analyses of samples from Puerto
   Rico in two different years of sampling. The functionality of the
   control assays and their acceptance criteria was assessed on the basis
   of relative recovery estimates of spiked enterococci target organisms
   extracted in the presence of water sample filters and sample-free
   control filters and was supported by observations that recovery
   estimates from the water sample and control filters were substantially
   different for samples that failed these criteria. Through the combined
   use of the SPC and IAC assays, two presumptive types of interference
   were identified. One type, observed in the tropical marine water
   samples, appeared to primarily affect the availability of the DNA
   templates for detection. The second type, observed in river water
   samples, appeared to primarily affect PCR amplification efficiency. In
   the presence of DNA template interference, adjustments from SPC assay
   results by the Delta Delta Ct comparative Ct calculation method
   decreased the variability of spiked enterococci recovery estimates and
   increased the similarity with control filters as compared to unadjusted
   recovery estimates obtained by the Delta Ct calculation method. Use of a
   higher salmon DNA concentration in the extraction buffer also reduced
   this type of interference. The effects of amplification interference
   were largely reversed by dilution of the DNA extracts and even more
   effectively by the use of an alternative, commercial PCR reagent,

   Also called change point problems, if not accounted for, these could

Abstract = {{The red-throated diver (Gavia stellata) is listed on Annex I of the
   European Union Birds Directive and requires protection within Special
   Protection Areas (SPAs), among other conservation measures. The Outer
   Thames Estuary, east England, was known to support almost half of the
   Great Britain wintering population of red-throated divers but
   delineating an SPA boundary there was not straightforward as existing
   boundary-setting methods did not perform well. The number and
   distribution of red-throated divers in the Outer Thames Estuary was
   determined using visual aerial survey methods. Bird observations were
   smoothed using kernel density estimation (KDE) and were combined to
   create a mean modelled density surface. A threshold density was
   identified using maximum curvature and an SPA boundary was drawn around
   all cells on the density surface with a density greater than the
   threshold density. The SPA boundary contained 6301 red-throated divers
   in an area of 3937 km(2), which was 77.5\% of the estimated Outer Thames
   Estuary red-throated diver population in an area of only 38.9\% of the
   study area. This boundary was adopted in 2010 when the Outer Thames
   Estuary SPA was classified. This method is suited to a species that is
   aggregated at medium to large scales and for which appropriate
   environmental covariates are lacking. It is relatively simple, which is
   advantageous when communicating methods to non-scientists, and provides
   an objective method for drawing an MPA boundary that is robust to
   challenge by stakeholders who may wish the MPA to be larger or smaller.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Although many climate-sensitive environmental exposures are
   related to mortality and morbidity, there is a paucity of estimates of
   the public health burden attributable to climate change.
   OBJECTIVE: We estimated the excess current and future public health
   impacts related to respiratory hospitalizations attributable to extreme
   heat in summer in New York State (NYS) overall, its geographic regions,
   and across different demographic strata.
   METHODS: On the basis of threshold temperature and percent risk changes
   identified from our study in NYS, we estimated recent and future
   attributable risks related to extreme heat due to climate change using
   the global climate model with various climate scenarios. We estimated
   effects of extreme high apparent temperature in summer on respiratory
   admissions, days hospitalized, direct hospitalization costs, and lost
   productivity from days hospitalized after adjusting for inflation.
   RESULTS: The estimated respiratory disease burden attributable to
   extreme heat at baseline (1991-2004) in NYS was 100 hospital admissions,
   US\$644,069 in direct hospitalization costs, and 616 days of
   hospitalization per year. Projections for 2080-2099 based on three
   different climate scenarios ranged from 206-607 excess hospital
   admissions, US\$26-\$76 million in hospitalization costs, and
   1,299-3,744 days of hospitalization per year. Estimated impacts varied
   by geographic region and population demographics.
   CONCLUSIONS: We estimated that excess respiratory admissions in NYS due
   to excessive heat would be 2 to 6 times higher in 2080-2099 than in
   1991-2004. When combined with other heat-associated diseases and
   mortality, the potential public health burden associated with global
   warming could be substantial.}},

Abstract = {{Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are highly toxic environmental
   pollutants that can accumulate in soils. We consider the problem of
   explaining and mapping the spatial distribution of PCBs using a spatial
   data set of 105 PCB-187 measurements from a region in the north of
   France. A large proportion of our data (35\%) fell below a
   quantification limit (QL), meaning that their concentrations could not
   be determined to a sufficient degree of precision. Where a measurement
   fell below this QL, the inequality information was all that we were
   presented with. In this work, we demonstrate a full geostatistical
   analysis-bringing together the various components, including model
   selection, cross-validation, and mapping using censored data to
   represent the uncertainty that results from below-QL observations. We
   implement a Monte Carlo maximum likelihood approach to estimate the
   geostatistical model parameters. To select the best set of explanatory
   variables for explaining and mapping the spatial distribution of PCB-187
   concentrations, we apply the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The AIC
   provides a trade-off between the goodness-of-fit of a model and its
   complexity (i.e., the number of covariates). We then use the best set of
   explanatory variables to help interpolate the measurements via a
   Bayesian approach, and produce maps of the predictions. We calculate
   predictions of the probability of exceeding a concentration threshold,
   above which the land could be considered as contaminated. The work
   demonstrates some differences between approaches based on censored data
   and on imputed data (in which the below-QL data are replaced by a value
   of half of the QL). Cross-validation results demonstrate better
   predictions based on the censored data approach, and we should therefore
   have confidence in the information provided by predictions from this
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Aim As climate change is increasing the frequency, severity and extent
   of wildfire and bark beetle outbreaks, it is important to understand how
   these disturbances interact to affect ecological patterns and processes,
   including susceptibility to subsequent disturbances. Stand-replacing
   fires and outbreaks of mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus
   ponderosae, are both important disturbances in the lodgepole pine, Pinus
   contorta, forests of the Rocky Mountains. In the current study we
   investigated how time since the last stand-replacing fire affects the
   susceptibility of the stand to MPB outbreaks in these forests. We
   hypothesized that at a stand-scale, young post-fire stands (< c. 100150
   years old) are less susceptible to past and current MPB outbreaks than
   are older stands. Location Colorado, USA. Methods We used
   dendroecological methods to reconstruct stand-origin dates and the
   history of outbreaks in 23 lodgepole pine stands. Results The relatively
   narrow range of establishment dates among the oldest trees in most
   sampled stands suggested that these stands originated after
   stand-replacing or partially stand-replacing fires over the past three
   centuries. Stands were affected by MPB outbreaks in the 1940s/1950s,
   1980s and 2000s/2010s. Susceptibility to outbreaks generally increased
   with stand age (i.e. time since the last stand-replacing fire). However,
   this reduced susceptibility of younger post-fire stands was most
   pronounced for the 1940s/1950s outbreak, less so for the 1980s outbreak,
   and did not hold true for the 2000s/2010s outbreak. Main conclusions
   Younger stands may not have been less susceptible to the most recent
   outbreak because: (1) after stands reach a threshold age of > 100150
   years, stand age does not affect susceptibility to outbreaks, or (2) the
   high intensity of the most recent outbreak reduces the importance of
   pre-disturbance conditions for susceptibility to disturbance. If the
   warm and dry conditions that contribute to MPB outbreaks concurrently
   increase the frequency and/or extent of severe fires, they may thereby
   mitigate the otherwise increased landscape-scale susceptibility to
   outbreaks. Potential increases in severe fires driven by warm and dry
   climatic trends may lead to a negative feedback by making lodgepole pine
   stands less susceptible to future MPB outbreaks.}},

   investigation}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{In recent years a number of papers have quantitatively explored multiple
   steady states and resilience within a wide range of hydrological
   systems. Many have identified multiple steady states by conducting
   simulations from different initial state variables and a few have used
   the more advanced technique of equilibrium or limit cycle continuation
   analysis to quantify how the number of steady states may change with a
   single model parameter. However, like resilience investigations into
   other natural systems, these studies often omit explanation of these
   fundamental resilience science techniques; rely on complex numerical
   methods rather than analytical methods; and overlook use of more
   advanced techniques from nonlinear systems mathematics. In the interests
   of wider adoption of advanced resilience techniques within hydrology,
   and advancing resilience science more broadly, this paper details
   fundamental methods for quantitative resilience investigations. Using a
   simple model of a spatially lumped unconfined aquifer, one and two
   parameter continuation analysis was undertaken algebraically. The shape
   of each steady state attractor basin was then quantified using Lyapunov
   stability curves derived at a range of precipitation rates, but was
   found to be inconsistent with the resilience behavior demonstrated by
   stochastic simulations. Most notably, and contrary to standard
   resilience concepts, the switching between steady states from wet or dry
   periods (and vice versa) did not occur by crossing of the threshold
   between the steady states. It occurred by exceedance of the two
   steady-state domain, producing a counterclockwise hysteresis loop.
   Additionally, temporary steady states were identified that could not
   have been detected using equilibrium continuation with a constant
   forcing rate. By combining these findings with the Lyapunov stability
   curves, new measures of resilience were developed for endogenous
   disturbances to the model and for the recovery from disturbances
   exogenous to the model.}},

Abstract = {{Fine scale spatial mapping of historical tree records over large extents
   is important for determining historical species distributions. We
   compared performance of two ensemble methods based on classification

   combination of soil and terrain predictor variables to predict species
   distributions for 21 tree species, or species groups, from historical

   values of all species combined for random forests and boosted

   similar and ranged from 0.80 to 0.84. Although prediction probabilities
   were correlated (mean r = 0.93), predicted probabilities from random
   forests generated maps with more variation within subsections, whereas
   boosted classification was better able to differentiate the restricted
   range of shortleaf pine. Both random forests and boosted classification
   performed well at predicting species distributions over large extents.
   Comparison of species distributions from two or more statistical methods

Abstract = {{Field data relating aquatic ecosystem responses with water quality
   constituents that are potential ecosystem stressors are being used

   models that predict ecological conditions using a stressorresponse

   criterion. Analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC analysis)
   has a considerable history of successful use in medical diagnostic,

   but its use for informing water quality management decisions involving
   risk-based environmental criteria is less common. In this article, ROC
   analysis is used to evaluate predictions of ecological response variable
   status for 3 water quality stressorresponse data sets. Information on
   error rates is emphasized due in part to their common use in
   environmental studies to describe uncertainty. One data set is comprised
   of simulated data, and 2 involve field measurements described previously
   in the literature. These data sets are also analyzed using linear
   regression and conditional probability analysis for comparison. Results

Abstract = {{In response to climate change and other threatening processes there is
   renewed interest in the role of refugia and refuges. In bioregions that
   experience drought and fire, micro-refuges can play a vital role in
   ensuring the persistence of species. We develop and apply an approach to
   identifying potential micro-refuges based on a time series of remotely
   sensed vegetation greenness (fraction of photosynthetically active
   radiation intercepted by the sunlit canopy; fPAR). The primary data for
   this analysis were NASA MODIS 16-day L3 Global 250 m (MOD13Q1) satellite
   imagery. This method draws upon relevant ecological theory (source sink
   habitats, habitat templet) to calculate a micro-refuge index, which is
   analyzed for each of the major vegetation ecosystems in the case-study
   region (the Great Eastern Ranges of New South Wales, Australia).
   Potential ecosystem greenspots were identified, at a range of
   thresholds, based on an index derived from: the mean and coefficient of
   variance (COV) of fPAR over the 10-year time series; the minimum mean
   annual (PAR; and the COV of the 12 values of mean monthly fPAR. These
   greenspots were mapped and compared with (1) an index of vascular plant
   species composition, (2) environmental variables, and (3) protected
   areas. Potential micro-refuges were found within all vegetation
   ecosystem types. The total area of ecosystem greenspots within the upper
   25\% threshold was 48 406 ha; around 0.2\% of the total area of native
   vegetation (23.9 x 10(6) ha) in the study region. The total area
   affected by fire was 3.4 x 10(6) ha. The results of the environmental
   diagnostic analysis suggest deterministic controls on the geographical
   distribution of potential micro-refuges that may continue to function
   under climate change. The approach is relevant to other regions of the
   world where the role of micro-refuges in the persistence of species is
   recognized, including across the world's arid zones and, in particular,
   for the Australian, southern African, and South American continents.
   Micro-refuge networks may play an important role in maintaining
   beta-diversity at the bio-region scale and contribute to the stability,
   resilience, and adaptive capacity of ecosystems in the face of
   ever-growing pressures from human-forced climate change, land use, and
   other threatening processes.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) use in excess of crop needs may impact surface water
   quality and contribute to eutrophication. However, P loss from
   agricultural land to water has never been estimated at the Canadian
   national scale. In this paper, the risk of P desorption from Canadian
   agricultural land is assessed by the source component of the indicator
   of risk of water contamination by P (IROWC-P). The IROWC-P source
   component (P\_source) characterized the mobilization potential of
   soluble P and integrated four models of P desorption by water for
   dominant agricultural soil series of Canada on the soil landscape of
   Canada polygon scale (1: 1,000,000). The objective of our study was to
   describe and evaluate a standardized method for deriving the P\_source
   component. The P\_source was assessed over 5-yr intervals from 1981 to
   2006 for scientifically based knowledge by relating annual P balance
   values, soil test P (STP) analyses, soil P saturation index, and
   Self-Davis water extractable P extraction values. Results show trends of
   soil P enrichment for most Canadian provinces over the 25-yr period but
   also an increased percentage of farmland classified above the water
   extractable soil P environmental threshold of 4 mg P kg(-1). The
   Canadian Prairies and Ontario showed small P\_source values and almost
   no farmland above the environmental threshold. Quebec and the Atlantic
   Provinces had P\_source values that exceeded the environmental threshold
   in 2006; more than 33\% of farmland is classified above the
   environmental threshold value.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The goal of this study was to evaluate the sufficiency of the
   network of protected lands in the U.S. northern Rocky Mountains in
   providing protection for habitat connectivity for 105 hypothetical
   organisms. A large proportion of the landscape falls into one of several
   categories of protected lands. However, protected lands in the region
   are primarily higher elevation forest and mountain habitats. Little is
   known about how the network of protected lands may maintain connectivity
   for a broad spectrum of species expressing different habitat
   requirements and dispersal abilities. Location The study was conducted
   across the states of Montana and northern Idaho, USA, comprising an area
   of 30.2 million hectares. Methods We used resistant kernel modelling to
   map the extent of the study area predicted to be connected by dispersal
   for each of 35 species groups with different ecological associations. We
   evaluated the effect of vagility on protected area sufficiency by
   varying dispersal ability across three levels for each species group. We
   evaluated the degree of vulnerability of each of the 105 hypothetical
   species (35 species groups x 3 dispersal abilities) in terms of the
   extent of the total study area predicted to be connected by dispersal.
   We defined nine categories of risk as the combination of species
   vulnerability because of the extent of connected habitat and the degree
   to which that habitat was protected. Results We found high variation in
   the vulnerability of species because of the extent of connected habitat,
   and the extent to which connected habitat overlapped protected lands.
   Species associated with high elevations and species associated with
   lower elevations were predicted to have limited extent of connected
   habitat. Species associated with high elevations were predicted to have
   the vast majority of their connected habitat protected by federal Forest
   Service and National Park Service lands. In contrast, species associated
   with lower elevations were poorly protected by the existing network of
   protected lands. Main conclusions Low elevation and non-forest habitats
   are at highest risk of human-induced habitat loss and fragmentation in
   the study area. Conservation efforts in the region may be most effective
   if they focus on expanding the network of lower elevation protected
   lands in such a way that maximizes connectivity across the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{We use a real option approach to determine when a social planner has to
   stop or resume logging in situations where an endangered species relies
   on forest habitat for its survival. Logging affects the stochastic
   process followed by the habitat of the endangered species, which
   disappears irreversibly if its habitat reaches a critical extinction
   level. As long as the endangered species is still in existence, the
   social planner manages logging in such a way as to balance the risk of
   extinction against the benefits from commercial wood exploitation. The
   model incorporates economic, ecological, and social features. It is
   solved analytically to characterize the optimal forest management rule.
   Then it is applied to the case of the Rangifer tarandus caribou, an
   endangered species in Central Labrador (Canada). The parameters of the
   habitat process are estimated by Monte Carlo methods. The policy implied
   by the model - alternatively banning and resuming logging according to
   appropriate habitat threshold levels - turns out to be quite attractive;
   it does not require long banning periods while it drastically reduces
   the extinction risk and increases forest value. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Near real-time monitoring of ecosystem disturbances is critical for
   rapidly assessing and addressing impacts on carbon dynamics,
   biodiversity, and socio-ecological processes. Satellite remote sensing
   enables cost-effective and accurate monitoring at frequent time steps
   over large areas. Yet, generic methods to detect disturbances within
   newly captured satellite images are lacking. We propose a multi-purpose
   time-series-based disturbance detection approach that identifies and
   models stable historical variation to enable change detection within
   newly acquired data. Satellite image time series of vegetation greenness
   provide a global record of terrestrial vegetation productivity over the
   past decades. Here, we assess and demonstrate the method by applying it
   to (1) simulated time series of vegetation greenness data from satellite
   data, (2) real-world satellite greenness image time series between
   February 2000 and July 2011 covering Somalia to detect drought-related
   vegetation disturbances. First, simulation results illustrate that
   disturbances are successfully detected in near real-time while being
   robust to seasonality and noise. Second, major drought-related
   disturbance corresponding with most drought-stressed regions in Somalia
   are detected from mid-2010 onwards. The method can analyse in-situ or
   satellite data time series of biophysical indicators from local to
   global scale since it is fast, does not depend on thresholds and does
   not require time series gap filling. While the data and methods used are
   appropriate for proof-of-concept development of global scale disturbance
   monitoring, specific applications (e.g., drought or deforestation
   monitoring) mandate integration within an operational monitoring
   framework (e.g., http://www.fews.net/). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Exploiting three dimensional vegetation structure to map wildland extent}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{155-162}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Wildland and wilderness refer to areas of land which have been subject
   to little or no modification by human activity. These areas are
   important due to their role as wildlife habitats, the contributions they
   make to air and water quality and for human recreation. However, the
   intermingling of wildland and homes also increases the risk to life and
   property through wildfires. Management of this risk requires current and
   detailed knowledge of the spatial extent of wildland. What constitutes
   wildland vegetation is often difficult to define and may be influenced
   by both the horizontal continuity and vertical structure. We present a
   method to map wildland vegetation based on a combination of a vertically
   stratified cover threshold and spatial morphology.. To test its
   practical application, the method was applied to airborne lidar data
   collected prior to a major wildfire that occurred in Australia in 2009.
   Distance between the lidar defined wildland extent and homes impacted by
   the fire was assessed and compared to previously published data using
   manual delineation of wildland extent. Results showed that the
   proportion of homes destroyed at the wildland boundary was greater than
   reported in previous fires and that there was an exponential decline in
   the proportion of homes destroyed as a function of distances to
   wildland. Although the method is objective the extent of wildland
   depends on the parameters which define thresholds of cover and lateral
   extent and connectivity. This highlights the need for a clear definition
   of wildland that can be used to determine extent using objective methods
   such as those described, whether this is in the context of quantifying
   wildfire vulnerability or other related applications such as ecological
   assessment and monitoring. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative knowledge of organic chemical release into the environment
   is essential to understand and predict human exposure as well as to
   develop rational control strategies for any substances of concern. While
   significant efforts have been invested to characterize and screen
   organic chemicals for hazardous properties, relatively less effort has
   been directed toward estimating emissions and hence also risks. Here, a
   rapid throughput method to estimate emissions of discrete organic
   chemicals in commerce has been developed, applied and evaluated to
   support screening studies aimed at ranking and identifying chemicals of
   potential concern. The method builds upon information in the European
   Union Technical Guidance Document and utilizes information on quantities
   in commerce (production and/or import rates), chemical function (use
   patterns) and physical-chemical properties to estimate emissions to air,
   soil and water within the OECD for five stages of the chemical
   life-cycle. The method is applied to 16 029 discrete substances
   (identified by CAS numbers) from five national and international high
   production volume lists. As access to consistent input data remains
   fragmented or even impossible, particular attention is given to
   estimating, evaluating and discussing uncertainties in the resulting
   emission scenarios. The uncertainty for individual substances typically
   spans 3 to 4 orders of magnitude for this initial tier screening method.
   Information on uncertainties in emissions is useful as any screening or
   categorization methods which solely rely on threshold values are at risk
   of leading to a significant number of either false positives or false
   negatives. A limited evaluation of the screening method's estimates for
   a sub-set of about 100 substances, compared against independent and more
   detailed emission scenarios presented in various European Risk
   Assessment Reports, highlights that up-to-date and accurate information
   on quantities in commerce as well as a detailed breakdown on chemical
   function are critically needed for developing more realistic emission
   scenarios.}},

Title = {{Guidelines for a graph-theoretic implementation of structural equation
   modeling}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Structural equation modeling (SEM) is increasingly being chosen by
   researchers as a framework for gaining scientific insights from the
   quantitative analyses of data. New ideas and methods emerging from the
   study of causality, influences from the field of graphical modeling, and
   advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability, and even
   purpose of SEM. Guidelines for implementing the expanded capabilities of
   SEM are currently lacking. In this paper we describe new developments in
   SEM that we believe constitute a third-generation of the methodology.
   Most characteristic of this new approach is the generalization of the
   structural equation model as a causal graph. In this generalization,
   analyses are based on graph theoretic principles rather than analyses of
   matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels and causal diagrams, as
   well as an increased emphasis on queries and probabilistic reasoning,
   are now included. Estimation under a graph theory framework permits the
   use of Bayesian or likelihood methods. The guidelines presented start
   from a declaration of the goals of the analysis. We then discuss how
   theory frames the modeling process, requirements for causal
   interpretation, model specification choices, selection of estimation
   method, model evaluation options, and use of queries, both to summarize
   retrospective results and for prospective analyses.
   The illustrative example presented involves monitoring data from
   wetlands on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia National Park. Our
   presentation walks through the decision process involved in developing
   and evaluating models, as well as drawing inferences from the resulting
   prediction equations. In addition to evaluating hypotheses about the
   connections between human activities and biotic responses, we illustrate
   how the structural equation (SE) model can be queried to understand how
   interventions might take advantage of an environmental threshold to
   limit Typha invasions.
   The guidelines presented provide for an updated definition of the SEM
   process that subsumes the historical matrix approach under a
   graph-theory implementation. The implementation is also designed to
   permit complex specifications and to be compatible with various
   estimation methods. Finally, they are meant to foster the use of
   probabilistic reasoning in both retrospective and prospective
   considerations of the quantitative implications of the results.}},

Abstract = {{The composition and variability of airborne fungal spores were studied

   monitoring the total fungal spore burden in the air, Burkard 7-day
   volumetric sampler was used, whereas Andersen two-sage viable sampler
   was used for isolating the cultivable airborne fungi. Among the 37
   fungal spore types identified in the air samples, the predominant ones
   were Cladosporium, unidentified ascospores, unidentified basidiospores,
   Aspergilli/Penicilli, Nigrospora, Periconia, Chaetomium, Drechslera,
   Alternaria, Coprinus, Ganoderma, Pithomyces, and rust spores. Only six
   fungal spore types (Alternaria, Aspergilli/Penicilli, Cladosporium,
   Curvularia, Drechslera, and Nigrospora) were recovered in common by the
   two samplers. For Aspergilli/Penicilli, Drechslera, and Nigrospora, the
   spore concentration was underestimated in the non-viable sampling method
   (Burkard sampler). In general, higher spore count was recorded in
   winter. The highest fungal species variability was observed in early
   monsoon (June). Relative humidity could significantly predict the
   seasonal periodicity of the maximum number of airborne spores. The total
   airborne fungi concentration recorded in the study (15-16 x 10(3) spores
   m(-3) of air) was lower than the proposed threshold limit value for
   clinical significance, suggesting apparently no or less
   airborne-fungi-exposure-related health risk in the sampling area.
   Cladosporium cladosporioides was recorded beyond the proposed threshold

   Immobilization efficiency of agar, carrageenan and sodium alginate was
   evaluated separately in terms of luminescence response and was recorded
   as 30.3, 77.4 or 99.5\%, respectively. Under optimized storage
   conditions, the luminescent response of P. leiognathi in the immobilized
   state was studied over a period of 30 days. These biophotonic beads were
   further used as a rapid and reliable optical biosensing tool for the
   detection of heavy metals {[}Hg(II), As(V) or Cd(II)] and pesticide
   {[}2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)] in water systems. The
   concentration range for the detection of Hg(II), As(V), Cd(II) and 2.4-D

   corresponding sensitivity threshold was 2.0 ppm. 4.0 ppm. 16.0 ppm and
   100 ppm. A comparison of inhibition constant (K-d)(or EC20) values
   indicated that the sensitivity thresholds rank as Hg(II) > As(V) >
   Cd(II) > 2.4-D. Moreover, the time taken for the detection of heavy
   metals and pesticide was less than 30 min. Using the bioluminescence

   shipping data. The method is applied to data recorded in Falmouth Bay,
   UK. Absolute and relative levels of intermittent ship noise
   contributions to the 24-h sound exposure level are determined using an

   sources is then analysed using AIS data. This technique can be used to
   prioritise shipping noise mitigation strategies in coastal marine

Abstract = {{A solid-phase microextraction (SPME) device was used as a diffusive
   sampler for airborne propylene glycol ethers (PGEs), including propylene
   glycol monomethyl ether (PGME), propylene glycol monomethyl ether
   acetate (PGMEA), and dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether (DPGME).
   Carboxen-polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) SPME fiber was selected for
   this study A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing was used as the
   holder and the SPME fiber assembly was inserted into the tubing as a
   diffusive sampler. The diffusion path length and area of the sampler
   were 0.3 cm and 0.00086 cm(2), respectively. The theoretical sampling
   constants at 30 degrees C and 1 atm for PGME, PGMEA, and DPGME were 1.50
   x 10(-2), 1.23 x 10(-2) and 1.14 x 10(-2) cm(3) min(-1), respectively
   For evaluations, known concentrations of PGEs around the threshold limit
   values/time-weighted average with specific relative humidities (10\% and
   80\%) were generated both by the air bag method and the dynamic
   generation system, while 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min were selected as
   the time periods for vapor exposures. Comparisons of the SPME diffusive
   sampling method to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
   organic Method 99 were performed side-by-side in an exposure chamber at
   30 degrees C for PGME. A gas chromatography/flame ionization detector
   (GC/FID) was used for sample analysis. The experimental sampling
   constants of the sampler at 30 degrees C were (6.93 +/- 0.12) x 10(-1)
   (4.72 +/- 0.03) x 10(-1) and (3.29 +/- 0.20) x 10(-1) cm(3) min(-1) for
   PGME, PGMEA, and DPGME, respectively. The adsorption of chemicals on the
   stainless steel needle of the SPME fiber was suspected to be one of the
   reasons why significant differences between theoretical and experimental
   sampling rates were observed. Correlations between the results for PGME
   from both SPME device and OSHA organic Method 99 were linear (r =
   0.9984) and consistent (slope = 0.97 +/- 0.03). Face velocity (0-0.18

   of temperature and humidity have been observed. Therefore, adjustments
   of experimental sampling constants at different environmental conditions
   will be necessary.}},

   quality, catchment urbanization, and river restoration}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{63-72}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{It has been widely stated that pressures acting at large spatial scales
   influence local habitat conditions and might limit the effects of local
   restoration measures. However, only a few empirical studies have used
   statistical methods that have explicitly been developed to investigate
   such wedge-shaped relationships. The objectives of the present study
   were (i) to identify pressures acting as limiting factors and to
   investigate the mitigating effects of local restoration measures in
   three datasets from European rivers, (ii) to derive thresholds for the
   ecological status of invertebrates, and (iii) to compare results derived
   from two statistical approaches, one using aggregated response variables
   like biological metrics (quantile regression trees), another using
   taxon-specific responses to derive separate community thresholds for the
   negative response of sensitive and the positive response of tolerant
   taxa (Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis, TITAN). The results indicated
   that wedge-shaped relationships, typically resulting from limiting
   factors, are common in datasets from Central European rivers. There was
   empirical evidence for limiting effects of water pollution and catchment
   land use and an indication of a mitigating effect of hydromorphological
   restoration measures. The results emphasize the need to consider such
   large-scale pressures in river management and restoration because they
   potentially constrain the effects of local restoration measures. The
   thresholds derived for the aggregated response variables (metrics) and
   the community thresholds for sensitive taxa were in good agreement with
   values reported in the literature but differed markedly depending on the
   statistical method used. A possible reason is the different focuses of
   the methods on (i) the threshold for an aggregated response variable
   (metric), which includes the negative and positive response, and hence,
   reflects ecosystem functioning, and (ii) the community threshold of
   sensitive taxa based on taxon-specific negative responses, which is
   possibly best suited for species conservation issues. However, this
   interpretation requires further analysis since the results of the two
   methods showed no consistent differences. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Self-organization processes leading to pattern formation phenomena are
   ubiquitous in nature. Intensive theoretical and experimental research
   efforts during the past few decades have resulted in a mathematical
   theory of pattern formation whose predictions are well confirmed by
   controlled laboratory experiments. There is an increasing observational
   evidence that pattern formation plays a significant role in shaping
   dryland landscapes. Supporting these observations are studies of
   continuum vegetation models that have reproduced many of the observed
   patterns. Such continuum models consist of partial differential
   equations and lend themselves to the powerful methods of pattern
   formation theory. Indeed, vegetation pattern formation has been
   identified with mathematical instabilities of uniform vegetation states,
   occurring at threshold degrees of aridity. This paper describes
   applications of this modelling approach to problems in landscape,
   community, ecosystem and restoration ecology, highlighting new open
   questions and research directions that are motivated by pattern
   formation theory. Three added values of this approach are emphasized:
   (i) the approach reveals universal nonlinear elements for which a great
   deal of knowledge is already available, (ii) it captures important
   aspects of ecosystem complexity, and (iii) it provides an integrative
   framework for studying problems in spatial ecology. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Microcystins (MCs; cyclic heptapeptides) are produced by freshwater
   cyanobacteria and cause public health concern in potable water supplies.
   There are more than 60 types of MCs identified to date, of which MC-LR
   is the most common found worldwide. For MC-LR, the WHO has established a
   threshold value of 1 mu g L-1 for drinking water. The present MCs
   removal methods such as coagulation, flocculation, adsorption, and
   filtration showed low efficiency for removing dissolved MC fraction from
   surface waters to the stipulated limit prescribed by WHO based on MC
   health impacts. The search for cost-effective and efficient removal
   method is still warranted for remediation of dissolved
   MC-LR-contaminated water resources.
   Molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) adsorbent has been prepared using
   non-covalent imprinting approach. Using MC-LR as a template, itaconic
   acid as a functional monomer, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as a
   cross-linking monomer, a MIP has been synthesized. Computer simulations
   were used to design effective binding sites for MC-LR binding in aqueous
   solutions. Batch binding adsorption assay was followed to determine
   binding capacity of MIP under the influence of environmental parameters
   such as total dissolved solids and pH.
   The adsorptive removal of MC-LR from lake water has been investigated
   using MIPs. The MIP showed excellent adsorption potential toward MC-LR
   in aqueous solutions with a binding capacity of 3.64 mu g mg(-1) which
   is about 60\% and 70\% more than the commercially used powdered
   activated carbon (PAC) and resin XAD, respectively. Environmental
   parameters such as total organic carbon (represented as chemical oxygen
   demand (COD)) and total dissolved solids (TDS) showed no significant
   interference up to 300 mg L-1 for MC-LR removal from lake water samples.
   It was found that the binding sites on PAC and XAD have more affinity
   toward COD and TDS than the MC-LR. Further, the adsorption capacity of
   the MIP was evaluated rigorously by its repeated contact with fresh lake
   water, and it was found that the adsorption capacity of the MIP did not
   change even after seven adsorption/desorption cycles. The contaminated
   water of MC-LR (1.0 mu g L-1) of 3,640 L could be treated by 1 g of MIP
   with an estimated cost of US \$1.5.
   The adsorption capacity of the MIP is 40\% more than commercially used
   PAC and resins and also the polymer showed reusable potential which is
   one of the important criteria in selection of cyanotoxins remediation
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{1. Geolocation by light allows for tracking animal movements, based on
   measurements of light intensity over time by a data-logging device
   (geolocator). Recent developments of ultra-light devices (<2 g)
   broadened the range of target species and boosted the number of studies
   using geolocators. However, an inherent problem of geolocators is that
   any factor or process that changes the natural light intensity pattern
   also affects the positions calculated from these light patterns.
   Although the most important factors have been identified, estimation of
   their effect on the accuracy and precision of positions estimated has
   been lacking but is very important for the analyses and interpretation
   of geolocator data. 2. The threshold method is mainly used to derive
   positions by defining sunrise and sunset times from the light intensity
   pattern for each recorded day. This method requires calibration: a
   predefined sun elevation angle for estimating latitude by fitting the
   recorded day/night lengths to theoretical values across latitudes.
   Therewith, almost constant shading can be corrected for by finding the
   appropriate sun elevation angle. 3. Weather, topography and vegetation
   are the most important factors that influence light intensities. We
   demonstrated their effect on the measurement of day/night length, time
   of solar midnight/noon and the resulting position estimates using light
   measurements from stationary geolocators at known places and from
   geolocators mounted on birds. Furthermore, we investigated the influence
   of different calibration methods on the accuracy of the latitudinal
   positions. 4. All three environmental factors can influence the light
   intensity pattern significantly. Weather and an animals behaviour result
   in increased noise in positioning, whereas topography and vegetation
   result in systematic shading and biased positions. Calibration can
   significantly shift the estimated latitudes and potentially increase the
   accuracy, but detailed knowledge about the particular confounding
   factors and the behaviour of the studied animal is crucial for the
   choice of the most appropriate calibration method.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Thresholds often exist in the relationship between species richness
   and the area of remaining habitat in human-modified landscapes,
   prompting debate about the mechanisms responsible. We hypothesize that
   if speciesarea relationships differ with underlying factors such as
   landscape productivity, and such factors correlate with patterns of
   habitat clearance, then spurious thresholds can arise where the separate
   speciesarea relationships intersect. We assessed whether this phenomenon
   could explain landscape-level speciesarea relationships for birds
   occupying 31 landscapes of 100 km2 in eastern Australia. Location
   Eastern Australia. Methods Landscape-level species richness estimates
   were modelled as a function of the percentage of native vegetation
   remaining in the study landscapes. The performance of traditional
   speciesarea curves and continuous and discontinuous piecewise models was
   compared using an information theoretic approach. Separate models for
   high- and low-productivity and high- and low-fragmentation landscapes
   were examined to determine whether they implied different speciesarea
   relationships. Results The speciesarea relationship exhibited a rapid
   change-point at approximately 40\% vegetation cover, but this was most
   parsimoniously explained by two disjunct slopes rather than a continuous
   threshold model or a classic speciesarea curve. Exploration of models
   fitted separately to high- and low-productivity landscapes suggested
   that such landscapes may differ in their characteristic speciesarea
   relationships. Main conclusions The observed pattern is consistent with
   the spurious threshold hypothesis, and opens a new avenue of enquiry
   into the processes behind apparent ecological thresholds. This
   hypothesis may be valid in other regions where clearing history is
   confounded by underlying factors such as landscape productivity, and
   demands further research. In such systems, real thresholds for different
   landscape types may occur at different levels of cover, or might not
   exist at all. If so, a simple space-for-time substitution may not be
   valid, and management prescriptions based on threshold values (e.g.
   40\%) will be flawed.}},

   We studied host density thresholds in the dynamics of ecto-parasitic sea

   include a 1994 epidemic in Atlantic Canada and a 2001 epidemic in
   Pacific Canada. A mathematical model suggests dynamics of lice are

   threshold drops owing to environmental change, or is exceeded by
   stocking, causing epidemics that require rapid harvest or treatment.
   Sensitivity analysis of the critical threshold suggests variation in

   parasite abundances at subcritical host densities and estimate the
   critical threshold and transmission coefficient for the two epidemics.

Abstract = {{In ecotoxicology, critical effect concentrations are the most common
   indicators to quantitatively assess risks for species exposed to
   contaminants. Three types of critical effect concentrations are
   classically used: lowest/ no observed effect concentration (LOEC/NOEC),
   LC (x) (x\% lethal concentration) and NEC (no effect concentration). In
   this article, for each of these three types of critical effect
   concentration, we compared methods or models used for their estimation
   and proposed one as the most appropriate. We then compared these
   critical effect concentrations to each other. For that, we used nine
   survival data sets corresponding to D. magna exposition to nine
   different contaminants, for which the time-course of the response was
   monitored. Our results showed that: (i) LOEC/NOEC values at day 21 were
   method-dependent, and that the Cochran-Armitage test with a step-down
   procedure appeared to be the most protective for the environment; (ii)
   all tested concentration-response models we compared gave close values
   of LC50 at day 21, nevertheless the Weibull model had the lowest global
   mean deviance; (iii) a simple threshold NEC-model both concentration and
   time dependent more completely described whole data (i.e. all
   timepoints) and enabled a precise estimation of the NEC. We then
   compared the three critical effect concentrations and argued that the
   use of the NEC might be a good option for environmental risk assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Type-specific physico-chemical reference conditions are required for the
   assessment of ecological status in the Water Framework Directive
   context, similarly to the biological and hydro-morphological elements.
   This directive emphasises that natural variability of quality elements
   in high status (reference condition) needs to be quantified.
   Mediterranean streams often present a marked seasonal pattern in
   hydrological, biological and geochemical processes which could affect
   physico-chemical reference conditions. This study establishes general
   physico-chemical reference conditions (oxygenation, nutrient, salinity
   and acidification conditions) for different Mediterranean stream types.
   116 potential reference sites located in 23 Mediterranean catchments in
   Spain were sampled in spring, summer and autumn in 2003. All sites were
   subjected to a screening method for the selection of reference sites in
   Mediterranean streams (Mediterranean Reference Criteria) and classified
   using a pre-established stream typology that establishes five different
   stream types (temporary streams, evaporite-calcareous at medium
   altitude, siliceous headwaters, calcareous headwaters and large
   watercourses). Reference conditions (reference value and reference
   threshold equivalents to high-good class boundary) were calculated using
   two different methods according to the availability of reference sites:
   the reference site 75th percentile approach of all reference sites and
   the 25th percentile of the population approach. The majority of the
   studied potential reference sites (76 out of 116) were selected as
   reference sites. Regarding type-specific reference conditions, only
   siliceous headwaters could be considered different from the rest of
   stream types because lower conductivity and pH. All reference stream
   types presented seasonal differences as regards some parameters, except
   for temporary streams due to the high natural variation of this stream
   type. For those parameters which presented seasonal differences in a
   specific stream type, the least restrictive values were proposed as
   reference conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Managing invaded ecosystems entails making decisions about control
   strategies in the face of scientific uncertainty and ecological
   stochasticity. Statistical tools such as model selection and Bayesian
   decision analysis can guide decision-making by estimating probabilities
   of outcomes under alternative management scenarios, but these tools have
   seldom been applied in invasion ecology. We illustrate the use of model
   selection and Bayesian methods in a case study of smooth cordgrass
   (Spartina alterniflora) invading Willapa Bay, Washington. To address
   uncertainty in model structure, we quantified the weight of evidence for
   two previously proposed hypotheses, that S. alterniflora recruitment
   varies with climatic conditions (represented by sea surface temperature)
   and that recruitment is subject to an Allee effect due to pollen
   limitation. By fitting models to time series data, we found strong
   support for climate effects, with higher per capita seedling production
   in warmer years, but no evidence for an Allee effect based on either the
   total area invaded or the mean distance between neighboring clones. We
   used the best-supported model to compare alternative control strategies,
   incorporating uncertainty in parameter estimates and population
   dynamics. For a fixed annual removal effort, the probability of
   eradication in 10 years was highest, and final invaded area lowest, if
   removals targeted the smallest clones rather than the largest or
   randomly selected clones. The relationship between removal effort and
   probability of eradication was highly nonlinear, with a sharp threshold
   separating similar to 0\% and similar to 100\% probability of success,
   and this threshold was 95\% lower in simulations beginning early rather
   than late in the invasion. This advantage of a rapid response strategy
   is due to density-dependent population growth, which produces
   alternative stable equilibria depending on the initial invasion size
   when control begins. Our approach could be applied to a wide range of
   invasive species management problems where appropriate data are
   available.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In May 2010, a team of national and international
   organizations was assembled to investigate children's deaths due to lead
   poisoning in villages in northwestern Nigeria.
   OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to determine the cause of the childhood lead
   poisoning outbreak, investigate risk factors for child mortality, and
   identify children < 5 years of age in need of emergency chelation
   therapy for lead poisoning.
   METHODS: We administered a cross-sectional, door-to-door questionnaire
   in two affected villages, collected blood from children 2-59 months of
   age, and obtained soil samples from family compounds. Descriptive and
   bivariate analyses were performed with survey, blood lead, and
   environmental data. Multivariate logistic regression techniques were
   used to determine risk factors for childhood mortality.
   RESULTS: We surveyed 119 family compounds. Of 463 children < 5 years of
   age, 118 (25\%) had died in the previous year. We tested 59\% (204/345)
   of children < 5 years of age, and all were lead poisoned (>= 10 mu
   g/dL); 97\% (198/204) of children had blood lead levels (BLLs) >= 45 mu
   g/dL, the threshold for initiating chelation therapy. Gold ore was
   processed inside two-thirds of the family compounds surveyed. In
   multivariate modeling, significant risk factors for death in the
   previous year from suspected lead poisoning included the age of the
   child, the mother's work at ore-processing activities, community well as
   primary water source, and the soil lead concentration in the compound.
   CONCLUSION: The high levels of environmental contamination, percentage
   of children < 5 years of age with elevated BLLs (97\%, > 45 mu g/dL),
   and incidence of convulsions among children before death (82\%) suggest
   that most of the recent childhood deaths in the two surveyed villages
   were caused by acute lead poisoning from gold ore-processing activities.
   Control measures included environmental remediation, chelation therapy,
   public health education, and control of mining activities.}},

Abstract = {{A statistical genetics method is presented for estimating the genetic
   variance (heritability) of tolerance to pollutants on the basis of a
   standard acute toxicity test conducted on several isofemale lines of
   cladoceran species. To analyze the genetic variance of tolerance in the
   case when the response is measured as a few discrete states (quantal
   endpoints), the authors attempted to apply the threshold character model
   in quantitative genetics to the threshold model separately developed in
   ecotoxicology. The integrated threshold model (toxicant threshold model)
   assumes that the response of a particular individual occurs at a
   threshold toxicant concentration and that the individual tolerance
   characterized by the individual's threshold value is determined by
   genetic and environmental factors. As a case study, the heritability of
   tolerance to p-nonylphenol in the cladoceran species Daphnia galeata was
   estimated by using the maximum likelihood method and nested analysis of
   variance (ANOVA). Broad-sense heritability was estimated to be
   0.199?+/-?0.112 by the maximum likelihood method and 0.184?+/-?0.089 by
   ANOVA; both results implied that the species examined had the potential

Abstract = {{Conditional strategies are the most common form of discrete phenotypic
   plasticity. In a conditional strategy, the phenotype expressed by an
   organism is determined by the difference between an environmental cue
   and a threshold, both of which may vary among individuals. The
   environmental threshold model (ETM) has been proposed as a mean to
   understand the evolution of conditional strategies, but has been
   surprisingly seldom applied to empirical studies. A hindrance for the
   application of the ETM is that often, the proximate cue triggering the
   phenotypic expression and the individual threshold are not measurable,
   and can only be assessed using a related observable cue. We describe a
   new statistical model that can be applied in this common situation. The
   Latent ETM (LETM) allows for a measurement error in the phenotypic
   expression of the individual environmental cue and a purely genetically
   determined threshold. We show that coupling our model with quantitative
   genetic methods allows an evolutionary approach including an estimation

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Stable isotopes are increasingly used in ecology to investigate
   ontogenetic shifts in foraging habitat (via d13C) and in trophic level
   (via d15N). These shifts are in essence an individual-level phenomenon,
   requiring repeated measures throughout the life of individuals, i.e.
   longitudinal data. Longitudinal data require in turn specifying an
   appropriate covariance structure. Here we present a hierarchical model
   to jointly investigate individual ontogenetic shifts in d13C and d15N
   values. 2. In a Bayesian framework, we used a Cholesky decomposition for
   estimating a moderately-sized covariance matrix, thereby directly
   estimating correlations between parameters describing time-series of
   isotopic measurements. We offer guidelines on how to select the
   covariance structure. 3. The approach is illustrated with a hierarchical
   change-point (or broken stick) model applied to a data set collected on
   Southern Elephant Seals, Mirounga leonina. Ontogenetic shifts in
   foraging habitat, following a juvenile and variable stage, were detected
   and interpreted as fidelity to a foraging strategy; while ontogenetic
   shifts in trophic level were more likely the result of complete
   independence frommaternal resources followed by a gradual increase in
   trophic level as seals aged. 4. Specifying both an appropriate
   covariance and mean structure enabled us to draw strong inferences on
   the ecology of an elusive marine predator, and has wide applicability
   for isotopic ecology provided repeated isotopic measurements are
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To describe patterns of crop richness at a global scale and
   investigate the potential influence of energy, water, habitat
   heterogeneity, area and economic commitment to agricultural practices on
   patterns of crop species richness.
   Location World-wide.
   Methods Ethnographic literature for 86 subsistence-oriented societies
   was surveyed; 55 of these societies grow crops and 31 do not. These 86
   societies occupy the range of latitudes at which subsistence-oriented
   groups manage domesticated plant species. The number of domesticated
   plants that each society cultivates is reported. Regression analyses
   were conducted to evaluate predictions for relationships between crop
   richness, energy, area, habitat heterogeneity, commitment to cultivation
   and species taxonomic descriptions.
   Results Crop richness is positively and significantly related to energy
   availability and commitment to cultivation. The warmer the environment
   in which cultivators live, the more crop species cultivators grow. The
   more subsistence farmers commit to cultivation, the more crop species
   subsistence farmers grow. Above a threshold of 500 m in elevation range,
   crop richness is positively related to topographic heterogeneity. Mean
   annual rainfall, elevation, area, commitment to domesticated animals and
   exchange are not significantly related to crop richness.
   Main conclusions Crop richness in subsistence-oriented farming systems
   is conditioned by energy availability via the physiological tolerances
   of crop species. Crop richness is secondarily conditioned by topographic
   heterogeneity, which may serve as an estimate of spatial climatic
   heterogeneity. Where energy availability is a relatively weak constraint
   on crop production, commitment to cultivation for subsistence strongly
   conditions how much effort producers invest in diversifying their crop
   base. It is postulated that tolerance to freezing temperatures limits
   the ranges of domesticated plant species. This range limitation might be
   the result of niche conservation among domesticated crop species and a
   legacy of greater rates of speciation and lower rates of extinction
   among `free living' species in tropical settings.}},

Abstract = {{One objective of the European Union (EU)'s Water Framework Directive
   (WFD: Directive 2000/60/EC) is for all European surface waters to
   achieve `good status' by 2015. In support of this objective, the EU has
   facilitated an intercalibration exercise to ensure harmonized
   definitions of the status of water bodies, reflecting the deviation of
   their properties (mainly biotic assemblages) from a minimally disturbed
   state, termed the ``reference condition{''}. One of the major challenges
   of the WFD has been to find common approaches for defining reference
   conditions and to define the level of anthropogenic intervention allowed
   in reference sites. In this paper we describe how river reference sites
   were selected in the Central-Baltic region of Europe. A list of pressure
   criteria was provided and 14 Member States (MSs) categorized each
   criterion according to the method (i.e. measured, field inspection,
   etc.) used for reference site screening. Additionally, reference
   land-use and water-chemistry thresholds were agreed among countries in
   order to base reference site selection on objective criteria. For
   land-use criteria, a reference threshold and a rejection threshold were
   established. Sites with all criteria below the reference threshold were
   considered to be reference sites; sites having most criteria below the
   reference threshold and only some parameters between the reference and
   rejection threshold were ``possible reference sites{''}. These sites
   were retained only after carefully checking the cumulative effects of
   the pressures using local expertise, and a posteriori water-chemistry
   evaluation was necessary. In general, the most widespread method for
   defining a reference site was the measurement of pressures, followed by
   field inspections and expert judgment. However, some major pressures
   (e.g. hydromorphological alteration) were evaluated in a number of
   different ways (e.g. measured, field inspection, expert judgment). Our
   meta-analyses reveal a need to reinforce standardization in the
   application of pressure criteria by Member States. The pressure criteria
   identified in this exercise should be refined and tested with biological
   data to help in the further validation of minimally disturbed sites
   (i.e. the WFD ``reference condition{''}) and to provide a firm
   foundation for ecological status assessment. This in turn would ensure
   that there is pan-European comparability when evaluating the achievement
   of environmental objectives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A microbiological environmental investigation was carried out in ten
   dental clinics in Italy. Microbial contamination of water, air and
   surfaces was assessed in each clinic during the five working days, for
   one week per month, for a three-month period. Water and surfaces were
   sampled before and after clinical activity; air was sampled before,
   after, and during clinical activity. A wide variation was found in
   microbial environmental contamination, both within the participating
   clinics and for the different sampling times. Before clinical activity,
   microbial water contamination in tap water reached 51,200 cfu/mL (colony
   forming units per milliliter), and that in Dental Unit Water Systems
   (DUWSs) reached 872,000 cfu/mL After clinical activity, there was a
   significant decrease in the Total Viable Count (TVC) in tap water and in
   DUWSs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in 2.38\% (7/294) of tap water
   samples and in 20.06\% (59/294) of DUWS samples; Legionella spp. was
   found in 29.96\% (89/297) of tap water samples and 15.82\% (47/297) of
   DUWS samples, with no significant difference between pre- and

   dental treatments, and decreased significantly at the end of the working
   activity (p<0.05). The microbial buildup on surfaces increased
   significantly during the working hours. This study provides data for the
   establishment of standardized sampling methods, and threshold values for

Abstract = {{Purpose Acidic red soils account for 21\% of land area in China and
   contain low ammonia concentration due to ionization to ammonium. The
   unusual high affinity for ammonia of marine Nitrosopumilus maritimus and
   acidophilic soil Nitrosotalea devanaterra has suggested that
   ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) may have greater selective advantage
   over ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in ammonia-limited environment
   because ammonia rather than ammonium is thought to be the actual
   substrate for oxidation. The aim of this study was to assess whether
   nitrification activity can be attributed to AOA and/or AOB by relating
   community structures of AOA and AOB to nitrification activity in acidic
   red soils in southern China.
   Materials and methods In this study, the composition and abundance of
   AOA community were investigated in acidic red soils of coniferous Pinus
   forest, broad-leaf Cinnamomum forest, bush forest (BF), and a 30-year
   agricultural field converted from bush forest (BFA). The composition of
   AOA based on archaeal amoA genes were analyzed by denaturant gradient
   gel electrophoresis, and the abundances of AOA communities were
   deter-mined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while
   soil nitrification activity was measured using N-15 pool enrichment
   technique.
   Results and discussion N-15 pool enrichment technique indicated
   nitrification activity in acidic red soils, but AOB were not detected.
   The absence of AOB in acidic red soils could be well explained by the
   low ammonia concentration ranging from 17.8 to 34.3 nM, which is far
   below the known threshold values required to support the growth of AOB
   in culture. Nitrification activity change coupled well with abundance
   and composition changes of archaeal amoA genes, particularly for acidic
   BF and BFA soils. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the putatively
   active AOA were related to amoA transcripts in a hot spring within the
   soil Crenarchaeota group 1.1b lineage.
   Conclusions These results suggest that AOA play important roles in
   ammonia oxidation in acidic red soils tested in this study.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Pages = {{75-87}},

Abstract = {{With climate change, modelling has suggested that increased
   inaccessibility of forage through snow may endanger some populations of
   arctic ungulates; however, contemporaneous data on snow-cover
   conditions, other ecological factors and ungulate responses are lacking
   at the landscape scale. Researchers have increasingly used remote
   sensing to map snow cover with higher accuracy, but such tools have not
   been utilized in research and management of arctic ungulate populations.
   We estimated field-measured percent snow-covered area (F-SCA) in
   wintering areas of endangered Peary caribou Rangifer tarandus pearyi in
   the Bathurst Island complex (BIC) and developed a threshold for a
   normalized difference snow index (NDSI) using Landsat data. We used our
   NDSI threshold and another threshold to estimate snow-covered area (SCA)
   in Peary caribou habitats in the BIC during 1993-2003, compared these
   estimates with snow data from the nearest weather station and assessed
   the adequacy of Landsat data for arctic ungulate research. Our
   calculated NDSI threshold of 0.70 reflected field observations better
   than the published threshold, and our estimated SCAs showed greater
   variation between study areas, between years and during snow melt.
   Estimated SCAs were not correlated with total snowfall or snow depth at
   the nearest weather station. We conclude that SCA using remotely-sensed
   data for ungulate habitats would be more useful than weather-station
   data. Our methods could detect winters with relatively mild snow-cover
   conditions, but not those with very severe conditions; therefore, we
   recommend development of NDSI thresholds corresponding to >= 75\% F-SCA,
   instead of >= 50\%. NDSI-derived SCA methods should prove more useful
   for southerly arctic regions where sun angles would be less limiting
   than in the BIC. Higher resolution imagery may be more suited than
   Landsat for the assessment of snow cover in arctic ungulate ecology.
   With climate change, further development of remotely-sensed indices of
   snow cover, such as NDSI and SCA, should enhance our understanding of
   how arctic ungulates may or may not adapt.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{65-67}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The allocation of resources among plant structures depends on size. For
   example, plants need to have a certain minimum size before they allocate
   resources into producing seeds. Furthermore, the allometric relationship
   between different plant structures and size has often been found to be
   adequately described by power functions. Allometric power functions have
   traditionally led to a bias when estimating and predicting e.g. seed
   production as a function of size using classical linear statistical
   methods. The statistical problems of using the linear models when
   estimating a power function with a threshold value have been solved but
   due to the relative complexity of the statistical solutions, the
   solutions are often not used in the ecological literature. Here, an
   intuitive and simple power model with a minimum size of allocation is
   investigated using a Bayesian estimation method on a simulated data set.
   The Bayesian estimation provided satisfactory estimates of the
   parameters in the model, and the model is suggested as a simple
   alternative when fitting allometric power functions to ecological data.

Abstract = {{Species distribution models are used for a range of ecological and
   evolutionary questions, but often are constructed from few and/or biased
   species occurrence records. Recent work has shown that the presence-only
   model Maxent performs well with small sample sizes. While the apparent
   accuracy of such models with small samples has been studied, less
   emphasis has been placed on the effect of small or biased species
   records on the secondary modeling steps, specifically accuracy
   assessment and threshold selection, particularly with profile
   (presence-only) modeling techniques. When testing the effects of small
   sample sizes on distribution models, accuracy assessment has generally
   been conducted with complete species occurrence data, rather than
   similarly limited (e.g. few or biased) test data. Likewise, selection of
   a probability threshold a selection of probability that classifies a
   model into discrete areas of presences and absences has also generally
   been conducted with complete data. In this study we subsampled
   distribution data for an endangered rodent across multiple years to
   assess the effects of different sample sizes and types of bias on
   threshold selection, and examine the differences between apparent and
   actual accuracy of the models. Although some previously recommended
   threshold selection techniques showed little difference in threshold
   selection, the most commonly used methods performed poorly. Apparent
   model accuracy calculated from limited data was much higher than true
   model accuracy, but the true model accuracy was lower than it could have
   been with a more optimal threshold. That is, models with thresholds and
   accuracy calculated from biased and limited data had inflated reported
   accuracy, but were less accurate than they could have been if better
   data on species distribution were available and an optimal threshold

   seven individual wastewater treatment plants located in Jilin and
   Heilongjiang Province, China, for estimating the mobility and

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of germination for species used for semi-arid land
   revegetation would support selection of plant materials for specific
   climatic conditions and sites. Wet thermal-time models predict
   germination time by summing progress toward germination subpopulation
   percentages as a function of temperature across intermittent wet periods
   or within singular wet periods. Wet periods may be defined by any
   reasonable seedbed water potential above which seeds are expected to
   imbibe sufficiently to germinate. These models may be especially
   applicable to the Artemisia steppe of the western U.S.A. where water
   availability limits germination in summer and early fall while cool
   temperatures limit germination in late fall, winter, and spring when
   soil water is available. To test accuracy of wet thermal-time models we
   placed seedbags with seeds of five species commonly used in wildland
   revegetation, as well as two collections of the invasive annual grass,
   Bromus tectorum L. into Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomin-gensis
   Beetle and Young zone seedbeds for 19 field incubation periods over four
   seasons. Hourly surface (1-3 cm) soil temperatures and soil water
   potentials were measured near the seedbags. These data were input into
   thermal-time models which predicted time to germination for each seedbag
   retrieval date. Binomial data representing agreement (1) or lack of
   agreement (0) of predicted and actual germination for each retrieval
   date were analyzed using logistic regression. Thermal summation method,
   season, water potential threshold, and species most affected accuracy of
   predictions (P<0.0002). A model which defined a wet period as >=-1.5 MPa
   soil water potential and summed progress toward germination across
   intermittent wet periods was most accurate in predicting actual
   germination by a retrieval date. Across all species, this model
   correctly predicted that germination would occur in seedbags 75-95\% of
   the time over the latewinter to mid-spring seasons, but only 50-71\% of
   the time for the fall-early winter season when time of soil water
   availability was least. Although the wet thermal-time model
   overestimated time to germination for some species and seasons, its
   accuracy should be high enough to evaluate germination potential by
   mid-spring for different species, sites, and climatic conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper describes the theory, data, and methodology necessary for

   characterize dynamic order, and, therefore, its regimes and regime
   shifts. This work is part of the SLB Sustainability Metrics Project,
   which aimed to evaluate movement over time towards or away from regional
   sustainability. One of the key goals of this project was to use readily
   available data to assess the sustainability of the system including its
   environmental, social and economic aspects. For this study, Fisher
   information was calculated for fifty-three variables which characterize
   the consumption of food and energy, agricultural production,
   environmental characteristics, demographic properties and changes in
   land use for the SLB system from 1980 to 2005. Our analysis revealed
   that while the system displayed small changes in dynamic order over time
   with a slight decreasing trend near the end of the period, there is no
   indication of a regime shift. Therefore, the SLB system is stable with
   very slight movement away from sustainability in more recent years.

Abstract = {{Core areas are often employed in space-use studies to emphasize sections
   of a home range where an animal supposedly concentrates its time spent
   (i.e., areas of intense use). The area designated as the core is often
   subjectively selected based on aggregations of animal locations, thus
   not quantitatively repeatable, or selected based on arbitrary areas from
   a home range estimator, thus not biologically significant. We present an
   explicit ecological model of space use for objectively delineating areas
   of intense use, or core areas, based on further refining the definition
   of core area as the area within which an animal spends a maximum amount
   of time. Core areas were delineated using a time-maximizing function
   derived from kernel analyses. Essentially, we plotted utilization
   distribution area against volume and determined the point at which the
   slope of the line fitted to the data is equal to 1; this point
   represents a threshold where the proportional home range area begins to
   increase at a greater rate than the probability of use and the
   corresponding isopleth value defines the boundary of the core area; an
   animal's time spent within this area is maximized relative to the
   periphery. We used summer locations from 60 adult female moose (Alces
   alces) to demonstrate our method. Moose core areas were bounded by the
   (x) over bar = 58\% (SD = 0.60) isopleth and comprised (x) over bar =
   77\% (SD = 6.09) of animal relocations. Core areas represented (x) over
   bar = 27\% (SD = 1.99) of the home range ((x) over bar = 3837 ha, SD =
   4336.15; 95\% utilization distribution) and were used an average of 2.16
   (SD = 0.20) times more intensely than home range peripheries.
   Proportions of intensively used areas, as defined by isopleth values,
   were not related to home range size. Our technique reflects a biological
   understanding of a core area and provides a repeatable, quantitative
   method that enables statistical testing of hypotheses related to the
   effects of environmental factors on home range and core area size and
   usage. Adopting our approach will greatly improve our capacity to
   understand and ability to compare spatial dynamics of resource selection

Abstract = {{Numerous haematological diseases occur due to dysfunctions during
   homeostasis processes of blood cell production. Haematopoietic stem cell
   transplantation (HSCT) is a therapeutic option for the treatment of
   haematological malignancy and congenital immunodeficiency. Today, HSCT
   is widely applied as an alternative method to bone marrow
   transplantation; however, HSCT can be a risky procedure because of
   potential side effects and complications after transplantations.
   Although an optimal regimen to achieve successful HSCT while maintaining
   quality of life is to be developed, even theoretical considerations such
   as the evaluations of successful engraftments and proposals of clinical
   management strategies have not been fully discussed yet.
   In this paper, we construct and investigate mathematical models that
   describe the kinetics of hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and
   granulopoiesis under the influence of growth factors. Moreover, we
   derive theoretical conditions for successful HSCT, primarily on the
   basis of the idea that the basic reproduction number R-0 represents a
   threshold condition for a population to successfully grow in a given
   steady-state environment. Successful engraftment of transplanted
   haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is subsequently ensured by employing a
   concept of dynamical systems theory known as `persistence'. On the basis
   of the implications from the modelling study, we discuss how the
   conditions derived for a successful HSCT are used to link to

   Ultraweak Luminescence}},
Journal = {{ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Pages = {{380-392}},
Abstract = {{Protecting the environment requires ensuring such conditions that
   organisms living in it did not suffer permanent damage to their
   structures and life functions. This also applies to algae living in the
   aquatic environment. Some species of water flora especially quickly
   react to negative stimuli arriving from the environment. Their reactions
   to experienced stress may be a subtle criterion for assessing the
   condition of aquatic environment. To this kind of plants belong Chara,
   which are bioindicators of water quality. Their response to applied
   environmental stimuli is rapid changes of the electrical parameters of
   the cell membrane. Our research shows that there is also a change in the
   intensity of ultraweak luminescence (UWL) generated by these plants. UWL
   is a phenomenon that continuously accompanies processes occurring in
   living cells and its intensity is less than the threshold sensitivity of
   the human eye. The method of measurement of this little known way of
   Chara's response to environmental stimuli has the advantage that it is
   completely non-invasive for the test material. Non-invasiveness is due
   to the fact that the radiation emitted from the samples is measured
   outside the cell membrane separating the living matter from the
   surrounding environment.
   In our study, after exposure to a selected stimulus, three types of
   responses of plant cells were observed: 1) - after a temporary increase
   of UWL, there is a return to the level of light corresponding to
   undisturbed homeostasis (e.g. when ascorbic acid is added to the
   environment); 2) - after a temporary increase in the UWL, the emission
   of photons slightly falls and stabilizes at a new higher level of
   illumination (when the stress stimulus is e.g. lead acetate, the
   emission intensity is 2.2 times larger than in the beginning); 3) -
   after a sudden and significant increase of UWL, the high emission level
   is maintained for many hours (e.g. after adding sucrose follows a
   20-fold increase of UWL).
   UWL curves obtained in our experiments correlate with the changes of
   entropy corresponding to the disturbance of homeostasis in individual
   cases, depending on the applied stimulus. Respectively: for 1) - an
   increase of entropy is temporary and is followed by a return to values
   before the application of the stimulus, 2) - a lasting change occurs,
   which consists in an increase of entropy to a new fixed level, 3) -
   change in entropy is so large that its value exceeds the so-called point
   of no return, which means that the disorder of homeostasis leads to cell
   death.
   The application of luminescence imaging technique Single Photon Counting
   Imaging (SPCI) to the test cells have revealed that the emission of
   photons from different parts of the plant has a different intensity.
   When the plant suffered mechanical damage by cutting pseudoleaves, the
   emission from the damaged sites increased dramatically. This observation
   allows the damage to be located. Thanks to SPCI technique, it is also
   possible to track over time any repair processes.
   The clear differentiation of UWL kinetics leads to the conclusion that
   monitoring its intensity can be a good research tool in environmental
   protection. It makes it possible to determine whether chemicals found in
   the aquatic environment are harmful to a given species of plants. It can
   be also assessed whether the degree of the harm threatens the entire
   population with extinction. Thus, the presented method can be used as an
   ecotoxicity test.}},

   functions of management. The essence of philosophy HSMS best describes
   the statement of its creator D. Paterson, saying that ``hazardous
   activities, hazardous conditions and accidents, are events which are a
   manifestation of interference in the management system{''}.
   About the needed to implement the principles of health and safety
   management system (HSMS) show both the limited effectiveness of existing
   methods of security analysis (these methods are mainly based on grouping
   and balancing the number of accidents and the assessment retrospective
   models and their causes and circumstances), and the reasons: the nature
   law (the need to adapt legal solution of the country to the requirements
   in force in EU member states), the nature of organizational (need for
   the use and processing of information resources on the state of existing
   hazards and exposures), an economic nature (the problem of relations
   with the insurance premiums threat risk categories) and social (lack of
   social acceptance for work in conditions that threaten life and health
   of the employee.).
   In Poland, in accordance with the applicable regulations for the
   employer to ensure safe and healthy working conditions. Currently
   technical measures to improve the quality of health and safety have
   reached a satisfactory level so that possibilities of improving the
   security situation is increasingly placed in the attitudes and behaviors
   of people in the work process. Therefore, the next study the causes and
   circumstances of past accidents, are taken the activities of a
   preventive nature aimed at exploring the potential threats. These
   objectives can be realized, among others by audit testing research of
   health and safety management system (in the whole work establishment or
   separate elements in its structure), and professional risk management
   procedures (analysis and risk assessment).
   In this article discusses the procedures involved in testing the quality
   of health and safety management work on the example of one of the
   positions (the operator of equipment - landfill) located at municipal
   waste dumping ground in the northwestern part of Silesia. In the study
   of audit testing of the health and safety management system was used a
   MERIT questionnaire (which includes 9 problem areas) and within risk
   assessment a method of PN-N18002:2000 and the method of the Silesian
   University. In the case of audit testing the areas that are highest
   rated was Area B - ``A a study the accidents{''}, C - ``The control and
   inspection of safety{''}, and E - ``The Personal Protection{''}, for
   which the final values of indicators evaluations amounted to: for the
   area B - 3.78, for area C - 3.65, and for the area of E - 3.12. The
   areas of the lowest evaluated was: area A - ``Planning activities in the
   area of safety management{''} (index value WOPA = 1.85), Area G -
   ``Information of the state of health and safety ``(index value WOPG =
   2.1) and area H -{''}Promoting Health and Safety ``(index value WOPH =
   2,1). Risk assessment carried out by two methods helped define both
   sources of risk / exposure (method PN-N18002:2000) as well as the type
   of work activities, during the execution are created the potentially the
   greatest danger / endangering the health / life of the employee (the
   method of the Silesian University of Technology). The biggest threat to
   a person employed as an equipment operator - waste dumps pose a elements
   of substantive the environment. This situation results from the use of
   the compactor (vibration, noise, dust) and work on the the area of
   bottom of the trough, in which the processes of putrefaction (landfill
   gases, bacterias). Therefore, the occupational risk which was determined
   by using the PN\_N18002:2000 for the above sources of threat has been
   assessed at high risk. Activities are the most dangerous a riding by a
   compactor (240 min.) and a segregation of materials (150 min). In both
   cases we have to deal with a important risk.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of soil heavy metal concentration is very important for
   assessing the purity and quality of the soil in an environment. The
   concentrations of nine heavy metals (NHM), Zn, Pb, Cr, Cu, Co, Ni, Cd,
   Hg, and As, from the near-surface soils (similar to 015 cm) from an
   industrial cluster in Kumasi, Ghana, were qualitatively and
   quantitatively measured and analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF)
   spectroscopy analysis. The sources of these NHM were mainly
   anthropogenic as a result of the indiscriminate industrial waste
   disposal. In all, a total of about 100 soil samples were taken from six
   sampling sites, four of which were industrial and the remaining two
   residential. Forty soil samples out of the total number were carefully
   selected for elemental analyses and the mean heavy metal concentrations
   were calculated using statistical methods. The results from locations of
   high industrial impact showed that the mean concentrations of the NHM
   present in the soil were in the order of Zn (189.2-908.6 mgkg-1), Pb
   (133.7-571.3 mgkg-1), Cr (91.3-545.8 mgkg-1), Cu (62.9-334.6 mgkg-1), Co

   the heavy metals recorded concentrations that ranged from 10-900\%
   higher than their respective threshold limit values (TLVs). Heavy metal
   concentrations from the residential sites were comparatively far lower
   with only Cr, Cd, and Hg registering concentrations between 65-250\%
   above their TLVs. The cluster with its residential communities is at a
   serious risk of soil heavy metal toxicity and awareness to this needs to
   be created as such.}},

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{169-177}},
Abstract = {{Predicting the change in abundance is pivotal for evaluating species'
   current conservation status and population viability. Empirical works
   have suggested that species with an increasing abundance have a more
   aggregated distribution than those with a declining abundance (namely,
   the change-aggregation hypothesis, CAH). Here we introduced an improved
   negative binomial distribution model of the occupancy-abundance
   relationship (OAR) to estimate the change in abundance from changes in
   occupancy or aggregation. Analysis of the model suggests that (i) in
   general the change in abundance is synchronized with the change in
   occupancy when the level of environmental heterogeneity remains
   constant, and (ii) there could exist a threshold of the population
   density above which the CAH is no longer valid. Tests using data of
   epigaeic ants in Fynbos of South Africa collected from different seasons
   and macro-invertebrates from different localities in streams of central
   Spain verified these model propositions and thus support the use of this
   model as a monitoring method for assessing species persistence. Results
   suggest that the change in abundance can be estimated from the change in
   occupancy often obtained from cost-efficient presence-absence records,
   and a revision of the traditional CAH is necessary to capture the
   threshold phenomenon in the change-aggregation relationship. This work
   thus signifies the use of the three distinct but related concepts of
   population structure (i.e. occupancy, abundance and aggregation) in
   conservation biology.}},

Title = {{Extreme value modeling for the analysis and prediction of time series of
   extreme tropospheric ozone levels: A case study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AIR \& WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{651-661}},
Abstract = {{The occurrence of high concentrations of tropospheric ozone is
   considered as one of the most important issues of air management
   programs. The prediction of dangerous ozone levels for the public health
   and the environment, along with the assessment of air quality control
   programs aimed at reducing their severity, is of considerable interest
   to the scientific community and to policy makers. The chemical
   mechanisms of tropospheric ozone formation are complex, and highly
   variable meteorological conditions contribute additionally to
   difficulties in accurate study and prediction of high levels of ozone.
   Statistical methods offer an effective approach to understand the
   problem and eventually improve the ability to predict maximum levels of
   ozone. In this paper, an extreme value model is developed to study data
   sets that consist of periodically collected maxima of tropospheric ozone
   concentrations and meteorological variables. The methods are applied to
   daily tropospheric ozone maxima in Guadalajara City, Mexico, for the
   period January 1997 to December 2006. The model adjusts the daily rate
   of change in ozone for concurrent impacts of seasonality and present and
   past meteorological conditions, which include surface temperature, wind
   speed, wind direction, relative humidity, and ozone. The results
   indicate that trend, annual effects, and key meteorological variables
   along with some interactions explain the variation in daily ozone
   maxima. Prediction performance assessments yield reasonably good
   results.
   Implications: This paper develops a statistical approach to both
   analyzing and forecasting daily meteorologically adjusted tropospheric
   ozone maxima in the presence of seasonality and trend. The methods are
   applied to a 10-year follow-up of daily maxima of ozone levels for the
   metropolitan area of Guadalajara. One-day-lagged and present
   meteorological variables, 1- and 2-day-lagged tropospheric ozone maxima,
   seasonality, and a curvilinear trend are important predictors of the
   daily tropospheric ozone maximum in Guadalajara. The method provides a
   reliable tool to predict ozone levels exceeding a relevant threshold.}},

Abstract = {{Fugitive dust emission, transport and deposition from phosphate
   fertilizer industries may pose an environmental hazard to the
   surrounding environment, particularly to soil. This study is to evaluate
   such hazard by investigating the fate of airborne pollutants, their
   transfer from atmosphere to soil surface, and their contamination
   potential. Concentrations of elements were measured in soil samples.
   Elemental analyses were carried out using ICP-AES and ICP-MS. Analysis
   of speciation of trace elements, using a sequential extraction method,
   was performed on the plant's raw material (apatite), product and waste
   (phosphate fertilizer and phosphogypsum). A model estimating local
   atmospheric dry deposition was formulated. Statistical analyses were
   performed on sample data. Measured phosphorus accumulated considerably
   to the north-east of the plant, mainly due to the prevailing wind and
   associated dry deposition. Results exhibited considerably
   above-threshold enrichments in potentially toxic, bio-available trace
   elements (Cd, Zn) (2.5-6.9, 295-506 mg kg(-1)) and radionuclide (U,
   20-98.69 mg kg(-1)) within a major deposition area. Speciation results
   revealed Zn and Cd occurring predominantly in mobile phases within the
   pollution source materials. Dry deposition calculation showed extensive
   input fluxes of Sr, Zn, Cr, U, Ni and Cd. Significant correlation was
   established between measured trace elements concentrations and their
   calculated deposition fluxes. Phosphorus species were the principal
   carriers of trace elements in soils. The phosphate industry poses a
   serious soil pollution hazard, with deposited contaminants being
   potentially hazardous to plants and groundwater. This study serves as a
   basis to assess the phosphate industry's risk impact on soil, while it
   introduces combined analytical methodologies for such assessment.}},

Pages = {{205-217}},
Abstract = {{The fishery for Alaska pollock Theragra chalcogramma in the western Gulf
   of Alaska is dependent on the strength of incoming year classes. Methods
   were developed to measure late-larval stage abundance and sizes at-sea
   and to use such data in a near real-time model to forecast recruitment
   about 4 yr in advance. Larval abundances were weighted for size-and
   temperature-dependent mortality to project the number attaining a
   critical size of 15 mm; this weighting reflects the greater survival
   value of larger larvae to the population. The method was applied to
   catches in the 2007 and 2008 larval surveys to show the feasibility of
   attaining near real-time estimates. The accuracy of the method to
   forecast recruitment was evaluated from historical data. Adjusting
   larval abundance for size-and temperature-dependent mortality improved
   the trend with recruitment, but the relationship was not significant
   over the entire time series (1979 to 2007) because of an increasing
   trend in predators of juvenile stages, decoupling the parameters. A
   threshold-based generalized additive recruitment forecast model was
   developed to account for autocorrelative structure caused by
   inter-cohort interactions and mortality-related factors occurring after
   the larval period. The model closely tracks past recruitment trends.
   Based on low larval abundances and high numbers of predators, low to
   moderate abundances of age-4 recruits were predicted for 2007 to 2011,
   which matched observed levels reasonably well.}},

Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{51-77}},
Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{When the sample activity is measured for various reasons several times,
   then with each measurement can be associated an individual decision
   threshold and limit of detection. Each measurement can be analyzed
   through its own decision threshold. The whole measurements can sometimes
   present contradictory results, some measurements being lower than the
   decision threshold and other higher. The problem then arises to build a
   decision threshold and a detection limit taking into account all the
   individual results, and to deckle if the radioactivity is finally
   detected or not. It is interesting to note that it is possible sometimes
   that the decision threshold taking account all results makes it possible
   to decide that the radioactivity is present whereas the totality of the
   individual results are negative in terms of individual decision
   threshold. The purpose of this article is to show how these thresholds
   and these coherent limits cumulated can be determined in way according
   to the experimental conditions. In a general way a rigorous method of
   cumulating makes it possible to systematically decrease the decision
   threshold and limit of detection in terms of activity. This approach has
   interesting applications in gamma spectrometry with multi-emitters,
   discharge or periodical environmental measurements. On the basis of
   measurements realized by the IRSN within the framework of the national
   monitoring of the environment, we will see the potential impact of these
   methods on the final assessments.}},

Abstract = {{Threshold detection methods are increasingly popular for assessing
   nonlinear responses to environmental change, but their statistical
   performance remains poorly understood. We simulated linear change in
   stream benthic macroinvertebrate communities and evaluated the
   performance of commonly used threshold detection methods based on model
   fitting (piecewise quantile regression {[}PQR]), data partitioning
   (nonparametric change point analysis {[}NCPA]), and a hybrid approach
   (significant zero crossings {[}SiZer]). We demonstrated that false
   detection of ecological thresholds (type I errors) and inferences on
   threshold locations are influenced by sample size, rate of linear
   change, and frequency of observations across the environmental gradient
   (i.e., sample-environment distribution, SED). However, the relative
   importance of these factors varied among statistical methods and between
   inference types. False detection rates were influenced primarily by
   user-selected parameters for PQR (tau) and SiZer (bandwidth) and
   secondarily by sample size (for PQR) and SED (for SiZer). In contrast,
   the location of reported thresholds was influenced primarily by SED.
   Bootstrapped confidence intervals for NCPA threshold locations revealed
   strong correspondence to SED. We conclude that the choice of statistical
   methods for threshold detection should be matched to experimental and
   environmental constraints to minimize false detection rates and avoid
   spurious inferences regarding threshold location.}},

   entropy model to assess bison range dynamics during the last 8000 years.
   As predictors, we used bioclimatic variables and vegetation
   reconstructions from the generalized dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS.
   We compared our range maps with maps of farmland and human population
   expansion to identify the main species range constraints.
   Results The Holocene distribution of European bison was mainly
   determined by vegetation patterns, with bison thriving in both
   broadleaved and coniferous forests, as well as by mean winter
   temperature. The heartland of European bison was in Central and Eastern
   Europe, whereas suitable habitat in Western Europe was scarce. While
   environmentally suitable regions were overall stable, the expansion of
   settlements and farming severely diminished available habitat.
   Main conclusions European bison habitat preferences may be wider than
   previously assumed, and our results suggest that the species had a more
   eastern and northern distribution than previously reported. Vegetation
   and climate transformation during the Holocene did not affect the
   bison's range substantially. Conversely, human population growth and the
   spread of farming resulted in drastic bison habitat loss and
   fragmentation, likely reaching a tipping point during the last 1000
   years. Combining SDM and dynamic vegetation models can improve range
   reconstructions and projections, and thus help to identify resilient
   conservation strategies for endangered species.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The aim of this study was to analyze air concentrations of
   chemical and microbiological pollutants in the vicinity of an organic
   waste treatment plant, Ecoparc-2, located in Montcada i Reixac
   (Catalonia, Spain), as well as to determine the seasonal trends. The
   human health risks due to the presence of those agents were also
   assessed.
   Methods Air samples were collected at different distances and wind
   directions from the Ecoparc-2 in two campaigns (winter and summer of
   2010). The levels of 19 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were analyzed
   by GC-MS or HPLC-UV. In turn, the airborne amount of total bacteria,
   gram-negative bacteria, and fungi (including Aspergillus fumigatus) was
   also determined.
   Results Mean VOC concentrations were found to be 32.4 and 15.7 mu g/m(3)
   in winter and summer, respectively. Fungi at 25 degrees C presented the
   highest geometric mean (1,126 and 863 cfu/m(3) in winter and summer,
   respectively), while the concentrations of fungi at 37 C and total
   bacteria were also important in the hot season (332 and 250 cfu/m(3),
   respectively). These results are in agreement with data obtained from
   the scientific literature. Anyhow, no significant differences were
   observed between both campaigns including those related to distances and
   wind directions. The current pollutant levels in the surrounding
   environment were also various orders of magnitude lower than those
   recently observed inside the facility.
   Conclusions The human exposure to VOCs near the Ecoparc-2 was estimated
   to be low. Furthermore, the current environmental concentrations of
   those chemical and microbiological agents were clearly below threshold
   values recommended by regulatory organizations.}},

Title = {{Ultrafine particle emission from incinerators: The role of the fabric
   filter}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AIR \& WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{103-111}},
Abstract = {{Incinerators are claimed to be responsible of particle and gaseous
   emissions: to this purpose Best Available Techniques (BAT) are used in
   the flue-gas treatment sections leading to pollutant emission lower than
   established threshold limit values. As regard particle emission, only a
   mass-based threshold limit is required by the regulatory authorities.
   However, in the last years the attention of medical experts moved from
   coarse and fine particles towards ultrafine particles (UFPs; diameter
   less than 0.1 mu m), mainly emitted by combustion processes. According
   to toxicological and epidemiological studies, ultrafine particles could
   represent a risk for health and environment. Therefore, it is necessary
   to quantify particle emissions from incinerators also to perform an
   exposure assessment for the human populations living in their
   surrounding areas.
   A further topic to be stressed in the UFP emission from incinerators is
   the particle filtration efficiency as function of different flue-gas
   treatment sections. In fact, it could be somehow important to know which
   particle filtration method is able to assure high abatement efficiency
   also in terms of UFPs. To this purpose, in the present work experimental
   results in terms of ultrafine particle emissions from several
   incineration plants are reported. Experimental campaigns were carried
   out in the period 2007-2010 by measuring UFP number distributions and
   total concentrations at the stack of five plants through condensation
   particle counters and mobility particle sizer spectrometers. Average
   total particle number concentrations ranging from 0.4 x 10(3) to 6.0 x
   10(3) particles cm(-3) were measured at the stack of the analyzed
   plants. Further experimental campaigns were performed to characterize
   particle levels before the fabric filters in two of the analyzed plants
   in order to deepen their particle reduction effect; particle
   concentrations higher than 1 x 10(7) particles cm(-3) were measured,
   leading to filtration efficiency greater than 99.99\%.
   Implications: The main implication of the study is that the use of a
   fabric filter in the flue-gas treatment section of incinerators is able
   to guarantee very low concentrations at the stack in terms of UFPs. As
   regards the incineration plants, a further implication of the proposed
   study is that an a priori negative social response seems to be
   unjustified when referred to the ultrafine particle emissions.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Pages = {{1-46}},

Abstract = {{Population fragmentation compromises population viability, reduces a
   species ability to respond to climate change, and ultimately may reduce
   biodiversity. We studied the current state and potential causes of
   fragmentation in grizzly bears over approximately 1,000,000 km(2) of
   western Canada, the northern United States (US), and southeast Alaska.
   We compiled much of our data from projects undertaken with a variety of
   research objectives including population estimation and trend, landscape
   fragmentation, habitat selection, vital rates, and response to human
   development. Our primary analytical techniques stemmed from genetic
   analysis of 3,134 bears, supplemented with radiotelemetry data from 792
   bears. We used 15 locus microsatellite data coupled with measures of
   genetic distance, isolation-by-distance (IBD) analysis, analysis of
   covariance (ANCOVA), linear multiple regression, multi-factorial
   correspondence analysis (to identify population divisions or fractures
   with no a priori assumption of group membership), and
   population-assignment methods to detect individual migrants between
   immediately adjacent areas. These data corroborated observations of
   inter-area movements from our telemetry database. In northern areas, we
   found a spatial genetic pattern of IBD, although there was evidence of
   natural fragmentation from the rugged heavily glaciated coast mountains
   of British Columbia (BC) and the Yukon. These results contrasted with
   the spatial pattern of fragmentation in more southern parts of their
   distribution. Near the Canada-US border area, we found extensive
   fragmentation that corresponded to settled mountain valleys and major
   highways. Genetic distances across developed valleys were elevated
   relative to those across undeveloped valleys in central and northern BC.
   In disturbed areas, most inter-area movements detected were made by male
   bears, with few female migrants identified. Northsouth movements within
   mountain ranges (Mts) and across BC Highway 3 were more common than
   eastwest movements across settled mountain valleys separating Mts. Our
   results suggest that relatively distinct subpopulations exist in this
   region, including the Cabinet, Selkirk South, and the decades-isolated
   Yellowstone populations. Current movement rates do not appear sufficient
   to consider the subpopulations we identify along the Canada-US border as
   1 inter-breeding unit. Although we detected enough male movement to
   mediate gene flow, the current low rate of female movement detected
   among areas is insufficient to provide a demographic rescue effect
   between areas in the immediate future (0-15 yr). In Alberta, we found
   fragmentation corresponded to major eastwest highways (Highways 3, 11,
   16, and 43) and most inter-area movements were made by males. Gene flow
   and movement rates between Alberta and BC were highest across the
   Continental Divide south of Highway 1 and north of Highway 16. In the
   central region between Highways 1 and 11, we found evidence of natural
   fragmentation associated with the extensive glaciers and icefields along
   the Continental Divide. The discontinuities that we identified would
   form appropriate boundaries for management units. We related
   sex-specific movement rates between adjacent areas to several metrics of
   human use (highway traffic, settlement, and human-caused mortality) to
   understand the causes of fragmentation. This analysis used data from
   1,508 bears sampled over a 161,500-km(2) area in southeastern BC,
   western Alberta, northern Idaho, and northern Montana during 1979-2007.
   This area was bisected by numerous humantransportation and settlement
   corridors of varying intensity and complexity. We used multiple linear
   regression and ANCOVA to document the responses of female and male bears
   to disturbance. Males and females both demonstrated reduced movement
   rates with increasing settlement and traffic. However, females reduced
   their movement rates dramatically when settlement increased to >20\% of
   the fracture zone. At this same threshold, male movement declined more
   gradually, in response to increased traffic and further settlement. In
   highly settled areas (>50\%), both sexes had a similar reduction in
   movements in response to traffic, settlement, and mortality. We
   documented several small bear populations with male-only immigration,
   highlighting the importance of investigating sex-specific movements.
   Without female connectivity, small populations are not viable over the
   long term. The persistence of this regional female fragmented
   metapopulation likely will require strategic connectivity management. We
   therefore recommend enhancing female connectivity among fractured areas
   by securing linkage-zone habitat appropriate for female dispersal, and
   ensuring current large source subpopulations remain intact. The
   fragmentation we documented may also affect other species with similar
   ecological characteristics: sparse densities, slow reproduction, short
   male-biased dispersal, and a susceptibility to human-caused mortality
   and habitat degradation. Therefore, regional inter-jurisdictional
   efforts to manage broad landscapes for inter-area movement will likely
   benefit a broad spectrum of species and natural processes, particularly
   in light of climate change. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Recent technical workgroups have concluded that trophic magnification
   factors (TMFs) are useful in characterizing the bioaccumulation
   potential of a chemical, because TMFs provide a holistic measure of
   biomagnification in food webs. The objectives of this article are to
   provide a critical analysis of the application of TMFs for regulatory
   screening for bioaccumulation potential, and to discuss alternative
   methods for supplementing TMFs and assessing biomagnification in cases
   where insufficient data are available to determine TMFs. The general
   scientific consensus is that chemicals are considered bioaccumulative if
   they exhibit a TMF?>?1. However, comparison of study-derived TMF
   estimates to this threshold value should be based on statistical
   analyses such that variability is quantified and false positive and
   false negative errors in classification of bioaccumulation potential are
   minimized. An example regulatory decision-making framework is presented
   to illustrate the use of statistical power analyses to minimize
   assessment errors. Suggestions for considering TMF study designs and
   TMFs obtained from multiple studies are also provided. Alternative
   bioaccumulation metrics are reviewed for augmenting TMFs and for
   substituting in situations in which field data for deriving TMFs are
   unavailable. Field-derived, trophic level-normalized biomagnification
   factors (BMFTLs), biotasediment accumulation factors (BSAFTLs), and
   bioaccumulation factors (BAFTLs) are recommended if data are available,
   because these measures are most closely related to the biomagnification
   processes characterized by TMFs. Field- and laboratory-derived BAFs and
   bioconcentration factors are generally less accurate in predicting
   biomagnification. However, bioconcentration factors and BAFs remain
   useful for characterizing bioaccumulation as a result of the transfer of
   chemicals from abiotic environmental compartments to lower trophic
   levels. Modeling that incorporates available laboratory and field data
   should also be considered for augmenting assessments of bioaccumulation
   potential. Modeling can provide a TMF-focused assessment for new or
   unreleased chemicals in the absence of field data by estimating TMF
   values and theoretical relationships between physical-chemical
   properties and TMF values (quantitative structureactivity
   relationships). An illustration of the use of physicochemical properties
   for estimating TMFs is provided. Overall, TMFs provide valuable
   information regarding bioaccumulation potential and should be
   incorporated into regulatory decision making following the suggestions
   outlined in this article. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2012;8:??. (c)

Abstract = {{The utility of numeric nutrient criteria established for certain surface
   waters is likely to be affected by the uncertainty that exists in the
   presence of a causal link between nutrient stressor variables and
   designated userelated biological responses in those waters. This
   uncertainty can be difficult to characterize, interpret, and communicate
   to a broad audience of environmental stakeholders. The US Environmental
   Protection Agency (USEPA) has developed a systematic planning process to
   support a variety of environmental decisions, but this process is not
   generally applied to the development of national or state-level numeric
   nutrient criteria. This article describes a method for implementing such
   an approach and uses it to evaluate the numeric total P criteria
   recently proposed by USEPA for colored lakes in Florida, USA. An
   empirical, log-linear relationship between geometric mean concentrations
   of total P (a potential stressor variable) and chlorophyll a (a
   nutrient-related response variable) in these lakesthat is assumed to be
   causal in natureforms the basis for the analysis. The use of the
   geometric mean total P concentration of a lake to correctly indicate
   designated use status, defined in terms of a 20?mu g/L geometric mean
   chlorophyll a threshold, is evaluated. Rates of decision errors
   analogous to the Type I and Type II error rates familiar in hypothesis
   testing, and a 3rd error rate, Eni, referred to as the nutrient
   criterionbased impairment error rate, are estimated. The results show
   that USEPA's proposed baseline and modified nutrient criteria approach,
   in which data on both total P and chlorophyll a may be considered in
   establishing numeric nutrient criteria for a given lake within a
   specified range, provides a means for balancing and minimizing

   two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS)] were used to provide a unique perspective
   about the assay's underlying analytical performance. HRMS analyses
   demonstrated that the target dioxin and furans were consistently
   captured in the assay's extracts. TOFMS analyses revealed that
   interferents in the sample extracts resulting from inconsistencies in
   the sample preparation process appear to be the primary factor
   contributing to the assay's imprecision. The conclusion of this research
   was the assay results cannot be expected to correlate directly with HRMS
   and should only be utilized as a screening technique (e.g., to identify
   the relative ranking of contamination, to determine if samples are
   above/below threshold levels, or to monitor a cleanup) for environmental

Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Exposure to cadmium has been associated with osteoporosis
   and fracture risk in women and elderly, but studies in children are
   lacking. In the present study we investigate the association between
   markers of bone demineralization {[}urinary calcium (Ca) and
   deoxypyridinoline (DPD) excretion] and urinary cadmium (Cd) excretion
   (as an index of lifetime body burden).
   Methods: 155 schoolchildren from 2 elementary schools in Lahore,
   Pakistan were included. Urinary Cd was measured as an index of lifetime
   exposure. We assessed the multivariate-adjusted association of exposure
   with markers of bone resorption, urinary DPD as well as with Ca
   excretion.
   Results: Urinary Cd averaged 0.50 nmol/mmol creatinine and was not
   influenced by age, height, weight and socio-economic status (SES).
   Independent of gender, age, height, weight and SES a doubling of urinary
   Cd was associated with a 1.72 times (p < 0.0001) increase in urinary DPD
   and, a 1.21 times (p = 0.02) increase in urinary Ca. Additional
   adjustment for urinary Ca revealed still significant associations
   between urinary Cd and urinary DPD. The shape of the association was
   linear without evidence of a threshold.
   Conclusions: Even in young children, low-level environmental exposure to
   cadmium is associated with evidence of bone resorption, suggesting a
   direct osteotoxic effect with increased calciuria. These findings might
   have clinical relevance at older age.}},

Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2299-2309}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Identification of thresholds (state changes over a narrow range of
   values) is of basic and applied ecological interest. However, current
   methods of estimating thresholds in occupancy ignore variation in the
   observation process and may lead to erroneous conclusions about
   ecological relationships or to the development of inappropriate
   conservation targets. We present a model to estimate a threshold in
   occupancy while accounting for imperfect species detection. The
   threshold relationship is described by a break-point (threshold) and the
   change in slope (threshold effect). Imperfect species detection is
   incorporated by jointly modeling species occurrence and species
   detection. We used WinBUGS to evaluate the model through simulation and
   to fit the model to avian occurrence data for three species from 212
   sites with two replicate surveys in 2007-2008. To determine if
   accounting for imperfect detection changed the inference about
   thresholds in avian occupancy in relation to habitat structure, we
   compared our model to results from a commonly used threshold model
   (segmented logistic regression). We fit this model in both frequentist
   and Bayesian modes of inference. Results of the simulation study showed
   that 95\% posterior intervals contained the true value of the parameter
   in approximately 95\% of the simulations. As expected, the simulations
   indicated more precise threshold and parameter estimates as sample size
   increased. In the empirical study, we found evidence for threshold
   relationships for four species by covariate combinations when ignoring
   species detection. However, when we included variation from the
   observation process, threshold relationships were not supported in three
   of those four cases (95\% posterior intervals included 0). In general,
   confidence intervals for the threshold effect were larger when we
   accounted for species nondetection than when we ignored nondetection.
   This model can be extended to investigate abundance thresholds as a
   function of ecological and anthropogenic factors, as well as
   multispecies hierarchical models.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{98-105}},

Abstract = {{Human activity, and in particular industrial activity, has altered
   natural environments. Here we present an experimental approach adapted
   to study the actinorhizal symbiosis in alder trees and shrubs submitted
   to abiotic stress. We measured the impact of exogenous nitrogen on the
   establishment of the alder symbiosis with Frankia sp., and its primary
   function; nitrogen fixation. Results showed our version of the growth
   pouch method was functional, and corroborated the gradual inhibition of
   symbiosis in the presence of increasing exogenous nitrogen
   concentrations. In mountain alder (Alnus viridis ssp. crispa) there was
   a gradual and suppressive effect of nitrogen on the relative number or
   root nodules, while in black alder (Alnus glutinosa) results suggested a
   threshold effect at 45 ppm N. Shoot to root biomass ratios were
   increased in the presence of the microsymbiont, and this effect was
   generally maintained even in the presence of heavy metals (As, Se or V).
   Alders and the actinorhizal symbiosis were not heavily affected by the
   presence of heavy metals, confirming potential applications in soil
   rehabilitation, however the distribution of metals in plant tissues
   sometimes changed when high levels of metals were present. A. glutinosa
   plants exposed to high levels of As significantly increased the
   allocation of As to roots (approximate to 90\%), while those exposed to
   high levels of Se rose their aerial tissue Se allocation to roughly
   86\%. A. glutinosa plants exposed to high V levels did not change
   behavior: V was in all cases preferentially accumulated in underground
   tissues (>= 90\%). Our results detail the use of a high-throughput
   approach to study the plasticity of the actinorhizal symbiosis in the
   presence of fluctuating nitrogen and metal conditions. These methods are
   transposable to numerous actinorhizal studies in both fundamental and
   applied research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Purpose UK local authorities are required by environmental regulations
   to keep a public register of contaminated land. In many towns and
   cities, there is growing concern of allotment holders about the quality
   of their allotment soils. Limited information on soil chemistry is
   available for the southwest of England. This work was carried out to
   assess whether any allotment and park soil in Bristol could be defined
   as ``contaminated{''}.
   Materials and methods Samples of soil, sediments and bedrock material
   were analysed for ``pseudo-total{''} As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and
   Fe by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Baseline
   heavy metal levels for this region were estimated on the basis of the
   composition of soil parent material, whilst sediment data provided
   information on the effect of chemical and physical weathering in the
   Bristol Avon River catchment area. UK Soil Guideline Values and
   statistical analysis were used to identify anomalies and sites requiring
   further investigation.
   Results and discussion Potentially contaminated sites were found at
   Durdham Downs Park (Pb, Zn, As), Troopers Hill Nature Reserve (Cu),
   Atwood Drive Allotments (Cd) and Packers Allotments (As). Estimated
   ``upper threshold ranges{''} of the heavy metals of concern can be used
   as a preliminary site-specific screening tool to identify anomalies
   requiring more in-depth investigation. This approach takes into account
   that the sandstone underlying the Bristol district is naturally enriched
   in some heavy metals, particularly As, Ni and Cr. The very strong
   positive correlations between pairs of the elements Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn, Cd,
   Cu and As in the pelite fraction (< 63 mu m) of stream sediments point
   to a natural origin of these heavy metals.
   Conclusions There is evidence of heavy metal enrichment in some of the
   allotment and park soils analysed. In addition to the influence of
   anthropogenic sources, the bedrock of the Bristol district can account
   for much of the soil As, Cr and Ni. Owing to the natural high background
   levels of some elements in the underlying bedrock, published
   ``ambient{''} soil heavy metal levels for England are not applicable to
   the city of Bristol.}},

Abstract = {{Demographic monitoring is a well established tool for conservation
   managers. But, monitoring programs typically do not offer methods to
   explore the relationship between projected population trends and the
   probability of trend detection. Moreover, conservation biologists need
   to evaluate and incorporate the effect of variability and habitat
   perturbation on the efficiency of monitoring programs.
   We studied population demography of an endangered shrub endemic to East
   Central Spain, Vella pseudocytisus subsp. paui in order to understand
   its present demographic performance, how it is affected by increasing
   variability and perturbation and how these two factors are related to
   monitoring and monitoring thresholds.
   Using Lefkovich demographic matrices on six years of data, we produced
   19 different population projections, and we compared these modeled
   projections against observed projection. We designated three
   conceptually important detection thresholds: an early warning; an
   unequivocal signal; and, a quasi-extinction threshold. Based on
   calculated detection times of all models for every threshold, we
   produced an averaged monitoring cycle (minimum visit frequency) to
   provide managers with a tool to design a consistent monitoring program
   for this plant.
   Our results indicate a relatively stable current population along with
   large detection times for critical threshold changes of modeled
   populations when considering small management changes (low population
   variability and low perturbation intensity). In contrast, model
   combinations incorporating high population variance and high
   perturbation produce disproportionally short times to detection of a
   significant population trend. In terms of designing studies to maximise
   results while minimising monitoring effort, designing a monitoring
   program capable of providing an early warning system of potential
   population failure requires more effort than detecting an unequivocal
   signal of decline.
   Finally, we propose two alternatives when calculating monitoring cycle
   (MC) values. One of them implies demographic MC if population
   perturbation and variation are high. For that, an optimal monitoring
   cycle is estimated based on a range of possible scenarios for population
   trends. Alternatively, we propose environmental MC, when low values of
   perturbation and variation are expected. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{Background: Children are sensitive to indoor environmental pollution. Up
   until now there has been a lack of data on air quality in child day care
   centers.
   Objectives: The aim of this study is to document the indoor environment
   quality of Paris child day care centers by repeated measurements, and to
   compare pollutant levels in child day care centers with levels in Paris
   dwellings.
   Methods: We selected 28 child day care centers frequented by a random
   sample of babies who participated in the PARIS birth cohort
   environmental investigation, and visited the child day care centers for
   one week twice in one year. Biological contaminants assessed were fungi,
   endotoxin, dust mite allergens, and chemical pollutants: aldehydes,
   volatile organic compounds and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)). Relative
   humidity, temperature, and carbon dioxide levels were measured
   simultaneously. A standardized questionnaire was used to gather
   information about the buildings and their inhabitants.
   Results: Airborne endotoxin levels in child day care centers were higher
   than those found in Paris dwellings. Dust mite allergens in child day
   care centers were below the threshold level for sensitization in the
   majority of samples, and in common with dwelling samples. Penicillium
   and Cladosporium were the most commonly identified genera fungi. The
   child day care center indoor/outdoor ratio for most chemical pollutants
   was above unity except for NO(2), the levels for NO(2) being
   significantly higher than those measured in homes.
   Conclusion: Chemical and biological contamination in child day care
   centers appears to be low, apart from endotoxin and NO(2). Failure to
   take child exposure in child day care centers into account could result
   in an overestimation of children's exposure to other pollutants. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Asthma morbidity has been associated with ambient air
   pollutants in time-series and case-crossover studies. In such study
   designs, threshold effects of air pollutants on asthma outcomes have
   been relatively unexplored, which are of potential interest for
   exploring concentration-response relationships.
   Methods: This study analyzes daily data on the asthma morbidity
   experienced by the pediatric Medicaid population (ages 2-18 years) of
   Detroit, Michigan and concentrations of pollutants fine particles
   (PM2.5), CO, NO2 and SO2 for the 2004-2006 period, using both
   time-series and case-crossover designs. We use a simple, testable and
   readily implementable profile likelihood-based approach to estimate
   threshold parameters in both designs.
   Results: Evidence of significant increases in daily acute asthma events
   was found for SO2 and PM2.5, and a significant threshold effect was
   estimated for PM2.5 at 13 and 11 mu g m(-3) using generalized additive
   models and conditional logistic regression models, respectively.
   Stronger effect sizes above the threshold were typically noted compared
   to standard linear relationship, e.g., in the time series analysis, an
   interquartile range increase (9.2 mu g m(-3)) in PM2.5 (5-day-moving
   average) had a risk ratio of 1.030 (95\% CI: 1.001, 1.061) in the
   generalized additive models, and 1.066 (95\% CI: 1.031, 1.102) in the
   threshold generalized additive models. The corresponding estimates for
   the case-crossover design were 1.039 (95\% CI: 1.013, 1.066) in the
   conditional logistic regression, and 1.054 (95\% CI: 1.023, 1.086) in
   the threshold conditional logistic regression.
   Conclusion: This study indicates that the associations of SO2 and PM2.5
   concentrations with asthma emergency department visits and
   hospitalizations, as well as the estimated PM2.5 threshold were fairly
   consistent across time-series and case-crossover analyses, and suggests
   that effect estimates based on linear models (without thresholds) may
   underestimate the true risk. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In environmental applications it is common for the extremes of a
   variable to be non-stationary, varying systematically in space, time or
   with the values of covariates. Multi-site datasets are common, and in
   such cases there is likely to be non-negligible inter-site dependence.
   We consider applications in which multi-site data are used to infer the
   marginal behaviour of the extremes at individual sites, while adjusting
   for inter-site dependence. For reasons of statistical efficiency, it is
   standard to model exceedances of a high threshold. Choosing an
   appropriate threshold can be problematic, particularly if the extremes
   are non-stationary. We propose a method for setting a
   covariate-dependent threshold using quantile regression. We consider how
   the quantile regression model and extreme value models fitted to
   threshold exceedances should be parameterized, in order that they are
   compatible. We adjust estimates of uncertainty for spatial dependence
   using methodology proposed recently. These methods are illustrated using
   time series of storm peak significant wave heights from 72 sites in the
   Gulf of Mexico. A simulation study illustrates the applicability of the

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method for environmental observation network design
   using the framework of spatial modeling with copulas is proposed. The
   methodology is developed to enlarge or redesign an existing monitoring
   network by taking the configuration which would increase the expected
   gain defined in a utility function. The utility function takes the
   estimation uncertainty, critical threshold value and gain-loss of a
   certain decision into account. In this approach, the studied spatial
   variable is considered as a random field in where variations in time is
   neglected and the variable of interest is static in nature. The
   uniqueness of this approach lies in the fact that the uncertainty
   estimation at the unsampled location is based on the full conditional
   distribution calculated as conditional copula in this study. Unlike the
   traditional Kriging variance which is a function of mere measurements
   density and spatial configuration of data points, the conditional copula
   account for the influence from data values. This is important specially
   if we are interested in purpose oriented network design (pond) as for
   example the detection of noncompliance with water quality standards, the
   detection of higher quantiles in the marginal probability distributions
   at ungauged locations, the presence or absence of a geophysical variable
   as soil contaminants, hydrocarbons, golds and so on. An application of
   the methodology to the groundwater quality parameters in the South-West

Abstract = {{Models of ecosystem change that incorporate nonlinear dynamics and
   thresholds, such as state-and-transition models (STMs), are increasingly
   popular tools for land management decision-making. However, few models
   are based on systematic collection and documentation of ecological data,
   and of these, most rely solely on structural indicators (species
   composition) to identify states and transitions. As STMs are adopted as
   an assessment framework throughout the United States, finding effective
   and efficient ways to create data-driven models that integrate ecosystem
   function and structure is vital. This study aims to (1) evaluate the
   utility of functional indicators (indicators of rangeland health, IRH)
   as proxies for more difficult ecosystem function measurements and (2)
   create a data-driven STM for the sagebrush steppe of Colorado, USA, that
   incorporates both ecosystem structure and function. We sampled soils,
   plant communities, and IRH at 41 plots with similar clayey soils but
   different site histories to identify potential states and infer the
   effects of management practices and disturbances on transitions. We
   found that many IRH were correlated with quantitative measures of
   functional indicators, suggesting that the IRH can be used to
   approximate ecosystem function. In addition to a reference state that
   functions as expected for this soil type, we identified four biotically
   and functionally distinct potential states, consistent with the
   theoretical concept of alternate states. Three potential states were
   related to management practices (chemical and mechanical shrub
   treatments and seeding history) while one was related only to ecosystem
   processes (erosion). IRH and potential states were also related to
   environmental variation (slope, soil texture), suggesting that there are
   environmental factors within areas with similar soils that affect
   ecosystem dynamics and should be noted within STMs. Our approach
   generated an objective, data-driven model of ecosystem dynamics for
   rangeland management. Our findings suggest that the IRH approximate
   ecosystem processes and can distinguish between alternate states and
   communities and identify transitions when building data-driven STMs.
   Functional indicators are a simple, efficient way to create data-driven
   models that are consistent with alternate state theory. Managers can use
   them to improve current model-building methods and thus apply
   state-and-transition models more broadly for land management
   decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Porous landscape detention basins (PLDBs) capture and filter storm water
   while taking advantage of the intrinsic quality of plants to act as
   water treatment systems. A two-layered subbase filtering medium is
   recommended for building PLDBs. The current design method creates the
   opportunity for incorporating waste symbiosis. In this study, the
   beneficial reuse of mixing urban waste stream materials into the subbase
   filtering media is identified. Based on the waste screening tests
   conducted in this study, three mixes were selected and examined for
   their leaching and clogging potentials over the years of service. They
   are (1) peat-sand mix, (2) compost-paper-sand mix, and (3)
   compost-paper-sand-tire mix. Laboratory tests showed no significant
   differences among these three mixes in infiltration capacity and
   leaching contents of nutrients, pathogens, and total metals. Subbase
   clogging tests were also conducted for these three mixes using sample
   storm water. The decay of clogged infiltration rate was measured as the
   sediment load was accumulated on and through the filtering layer using
   the selected mix. Three empirical formulas were derived to predict the
   clogging effect for these three waste-incorporated mixes. Using the
   recommended threshold infiltration rate of 2.5 cm/h, the life spans of
   these three mixes were assessed for an example PLDB built in the field.
   Based on a bench-scale test of dynamic infiltration rates, the
   waste-incorporated mix is predicted to reduce the clogging potential of
   PLDB by approximately 20\% compared with the currently recommended mix
   using peat and sand. However, shredded tires were also found to float in
   water and can be washed out of the basin during overflow events. Based
   on environmental benefits, construction cost, material availability, and
   life-span potential, the subbase mix using compost, paper, and sand is

Abstract = {{The recent paper by Bartolino et al. (Popul Ecol 53:351-359, 2011)
   presents a new method to objectively select hotspots using cumulative
   relative frequency distribution (CRFD) curves. This method is presented
   as being independent from the selection of any threshold and, therefore,
   less arbitrary than traditional approaches. We argue that this method,
   albeit mathematically sound, is based on likewise arbitrary decisions
   regarding threshold selection. Specifically, the use of the CRFD curve
   approach requires the occurrence of two criteria for the method to be
   applied correctly: the selection of a 45A degrees tangent to the curve,
   and the need to consider the highest relative value of the study
   parameter corresponding to a 45A degrees slope tangent to the curve.
   Using two case studies (dealing with species richness and abundance of a
   particular species), we demonstrate that these two criteria are really
   unrelated to the underlying causes that shape the spatial pattern of the
   phenomena under study, but rather related to sampling design and spatial
   scale; hence, one could likewise use different but valid criteria.
   Consequently, the CRFD curve approach is based on the selection of a
   pre-defined threshold that has little, if any, ecological justification,
   and that heavily influences the final hotspot selection. Therefore, we
   conclude that the CRFD curve approach itself is not necessarily better
   and more objective than any of the global methods typically used for
   hotspot identification. Indeed, mathematical and/or statistical
   approaches should not be viewed as a panacea to solve conservation
   problems, but rather used in combination with biological, practical,
   economic and social considerations.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the possibility of mapping depth from optical image
   data in turbid, sediment-laden channels. Analysis of hyperspectral
   images from the Platte River indicated that depth retrieval in these
   environments is feasible, but might not be highly accurate. Four methods
   of calibrating image-derived depth estimates were evaluated. The first
   involved extracting image spectra at survey point locations throughout
   the reach. These paired observations of depth and reflectance were
   subjected to optimal band ratio analysis (OBRA) to relate (R(2) = 0.596)
   a spectrally based quantity to flow depth. Two other methods were based
   on OBRA of data from individual cross sections. A fourth strategy used
   ground-based reflectance measurements to derive an OBRA relation (R(2) =
   0.944) that was then applied to the image. Depth retrieval accuracy was
   assessed by visually inspecting cross sections and calculating various
   error metrics. Calibration via field spectroscopy resulted in a shallow
   bias but provided relative accuracies similar to image-based methods.
   Reach-aggregated OBRA was marginally superior to calibrations based on
   individual cross sections, and depth retrieval accuracy varied
   considerably along each reach. Errors were lower and observed versus
   predicted regression R(2) values higher for a relatively simple, deeper
   site than a shallower, braided reach; errors were 1/3 and 1/2 the mean
   depth for the two reaches. Bathymetric maps were coherent and
   hydraulically reasonable, however, and might be more reliable than
   implied by numerical metrics. As an example application, linear
   discriminant analysis was used to produce a series of depth threshold
   maps for characterizing shallow-water habitat for roosting cranes.}},

Abstract = {{Russia has experienced twenty years of economic and social change, which

   sustainable development of Russia.
   The paper employs the UN Sustainable Development framework of indicators
   and assesses sustainability of Russia using multi-criteria evaluation
   methods, namely the uncertainty randomization multi-criteria evaluation
   method ``Analysis and Synthesis of Parameters under Information
   Deficiency{''} (ASPID). The analysis covers economic, environmental and

   The results show the potential of employment of multi-criteria methods
   for the sustainability assessment at the macro level and offer useful
   insights into multidimensional nature of sustainability and the role of
   priority setting in the evaluation process. Such an analysis reveals the
   degree of harmoniousness of sustainable development policy. It shows how
   different sets of priorities determine the outcome of multidimensional

Abstract = {{Field application of animal manure is a major cause of odor nuisance in
   the local environment. Therefore, there is a need for methods for
   measuring the effect of technologies for reducing odor after manure
   application. In this work, chemical methods were used to identify key
   odorants from field application of pig manure based on experiments with
   surface application by trailing hoses and soil injection. Results from
   three consecutive years of field trials with full-scale equipment are
   reported. Methods applied were: membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS),
   proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), gold-film hydrogen
   sulfide (H(2)S) detection, all performed on site, and thermal desorption
   gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS) based on laboratory
   analyses of field samples. Samples were collected from a static flux
   chamber often used for obtaining samples for dynamic olfactometry. While
   all methods were capable of detecting relevant odorants, PTR-MS gave the
   most comprehensive results. Based on odor threshold values,
   4-methylphenol, H(2)S, and methanethiol are suggested as key odorants.
   Significant odorant reductions by soil injection were consistently
   observed in all trials. The flux chamber technique was demonstrated to
   be associated with critical errors due to compound instabilities in the
   chamber. This was most apparent for H(2)S, on a time scale of a few
   minutes, and on a longer time scale for methanethiol.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the growing awareness of potential impacts of roads, managers
   demand well-designed studies about the implications of linear

   Before-During-After and Before-During-After-Control-Impact designs (BOA

   a population of great bustards (Otis tarda) as a model. Based on a time
   series of demographic and distribution data (1997-2009), we developed
   generalized additive models and classification trees to test the effect
   of road distance on bustard distribution, identify road-effect distances
   and explore the seasonality of these effects. Two control zones were
   selected to test the changes between construction phases on
   productivity, and population trends using TRIM models. From the start of
   the road construction, great bustards tended to avoid close proximity to
   the highway (ca. 560-750 m threshold distance). The exclusion band was
   narrower during the breeding season. In addition, family groups were
   less tolerant to highway operation disturbances, as shown by their
   higher distance effect (ca. 1300 m). Population trends did not differ
   between impact and control zones during the construction. However, once
   the highway was in operation, bustard numbers declined gradually up to
   50\% in the impact zone, remained stable in the closest control zone,
   and increased in the zone located at the greatest distance from the
   highway. The effects on density of family groups were less evident. Our
   approach provides information relevant to great bustard conservation and
   suggests methods for obtaining information of interest to road managers,
   that could be applied to linear infrastructures with others species. (C)

Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. Benthic macroinvertebrates (MI) are commonly used to assess
   freshwater ecosystems with the reference condition approach. Such
   assessments necessitate control for natural community variation, either
   by categorical typologies or by predictive models that have been widely
   and successfully developed for running water biota but not previously
   for lake profundal invertebrates.
   2. We evaluated four modelling techniques {[}multivariate regression
   tree (MRT), limiting environmental differences, nonparametric
   multiplicative regression (NPMR) and River Invertebrate Prediction And
   Classification System (RIVPACS) and the operative Finnish lake typology
   for assessing taxonomic completeness (observed-to-expected number of
   taxa, O/E) of profundal MI assemblages. We used data from 74 and 33
   minimally disturbed reference lake basins for calibration and validation
   of the approaches, respectively, and 72 test basins subject to various
   anthropogenic pressures to evaluate sensitivity to detect impact. Either
   all predicted taxa (threshold probability of capture P(t) = 0+) or only
   those predicted to be captured with >= 0.25 probability were used to
   calculate O/E.
   3. With P(t) = 0.25, all four modelling approaches were accurate (mean
   O/E = 0.966-1.053) but imprecise (SD of O/E = 0.279-0.304) in predicting
   the fauna actually observed in validation sites. All models were subtly
   more precise than a null model (mean 1.038, SD 0.343) or the typology
   (1.046, 0.327). The taxon-specific NPMR model was slightly more precise
   than the other three models based on site groupings.
   4. The O/E values correlated relatively weakly (r = 0.55-0.86) among the
   approaches, which thus produced contrasting lake-specific assessments,
   despite their seemingly comparable performances. Indeed, typology,
   suggesting that MI assemblages were impaired in 56\% of test sites, was
   more sensitive than the other approaches (26-46\%) as an indicator of
   human-induced deterioration. However, this greater ostensible
   sensitivity seemed to be biased, as lake morphometry, a main driver of
   natural community variation, remained uncontrolled by the typology.
   5. Generally, our exercise illustrates the inconclusiveness of the
   common validation criteria for the assessment methods. The apparent poor
   predictability of the profundal fauna, irrespective of the method, may
   partly stem from large observation error, which could be alleviated by
   more intensive sampling. However, instead of an O/E-taxa index, some
   other metric encompassing quantitative aspects might be preferable for
   assessing these species-poor communities.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Inhalation is one of the main means of human exposure to
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) because of their ubiquitous
   presence in the atmosphere. However, most studies have considered only
   PAHs found in the particle phase and have omitted the contribution of
   the gas-phase PAHs to the risk.
   OBJECTIVE: We estimated the lifetime lung cancer risk from PAH exposure
   by inhalation in people living next to the largest chemical site in
   Southern Europe and the Mediterranean area.
   METHODS: We determined 18 PAHs in the atmospheric gas and particle
   phase. We monitored the PAHs for 1 year in three locations near the
   chemical site in different seasons. We used toxic equivalence factors to
   calculate benzo{[}a] pyrene (BaP) equivalents (BaP-eq) for individual
   PAHs and applied the World Health Organization unit risk (UR) for BaP
   (UR = 8.7 x 10(-5)) to estimate lifetime cancer risks due to PAH
   exposures.
   RESULTS: We observed some spatial and seasonal variability in PAH
   concentrations. The contribution of gas-phase PAHs to the total BaP-eq
   value was between 34\% and 86\%. The total estimated average lifetime
   lung cancer risk due to PAH exposure in the study area was 1.2 x 10(-4).
   CONCLUSIONS: The estimated risk was higher than values recommended by
   the World Health Organization and U. S. Environmental Protection Agency
   but lower than the threshold value of 10(-3) that is considered an
   indication of definite risk according to similar risk studies. The
   results also showed that risk may be underestimated if the contributions
   of gas-phase PAHs are not considered.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{416-426}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Human activities have led to ecological regime shifts, first revealed
   at the community level in ecosystems. A regime shift in a biological
   community is a sudden change in the relative contributions of several
   taxa, resulting in a post-shift state that remains stable over the long
   term with a structure that is outside the boundaries of the `normal'
   pre-shift variability. Most methods for regime shift detection are based
   on univariate statistics (e. g. commercial fish catch data, sea surface
   temperature anomalies). Multivariate methods suitable for identifying
   change in multi-species communities can be used to identify regime
   shifts in communities.
   2. In this paper, I use a 37-year record (1972-2008) of phytoplankton in
   the Bay of Quinte (northeastern Lake Ontario) to demonstrate the use of
   several largely independent data analysis methods that are shown here to
   concur in their output. Among the most powerful procedures is an
   approach that models the anomalies around long-term Grand Mean and
   reference-point community structures that were compared to annual
   structures using Bray-Curtis community similarity coefficients. CUSUM
   plots of model residuals, segmented regression analysis and other tests
   are all useful to identify the location of break-points in records of
   anomalies. Follow-up significance testing was performed separately with
   permutation tests. Improved sensitivity of these techniques when applied
   to highly seasonal data was demonstrated after extraction of seasonal
   components as periodic functions.
   3. Statistically significant shifts in the Bay of Quinte phytoplankton
   were detected in the year following an approximate 50\% reduction in
   point-source phosphorus loading in early 1978 and again immediately
   after the establishment of invasive dreissenid mussels in the mid-1990s.
   Associated with this second intervention was an increased representation
   by species of the potentially toxic Cyano-prokaryote Microcystis, and
   dramatic declines in some diatom species, with significant implications
   for human use and food web function.
   4. This paper provides a `tool box' of methods (most freely available on
   the WWW) for those needing to distinguish between true shifts and normal
   inter-annual variability in biological communities. Ability to measure
   statistically significant change in communities can lead to enhanced
   understanding of cause-effect relations and to enhanced capabilities for
   prediction of change.}},

Abstract = {{Vector-borne diseases are of global importance to human and animal
   health. Empirical trials of effective methods to control vectors and
   their pathogens can be difficult for practical, financial and ethical
   reasons. Here, therefore, we use a mathematical model to predict the
   effectiveness of a vector-borne disease control method. As a case study,
   we use the tick-louping ill virus system, where sheep are treated with
   acaricide in an attempt to control ticks and disease in red grouse , an
   economically important game bird. We ran the model under different
   scenarios of sheep flock sizes, alternative host (deer) densities,
   acaricide efficacies and tick burdens. The model predicted that, with
   very low deer densities, using sheep as tick mops can reduce the tick
   population and virus prevalence. However, treatment is ineffective above
   a certain threshold deer density, dependent on the comparative tick
   burden on sheep and deer. The model also predicted that high efficacy
   levels of acaricide must be maintained for effective tick control. This
   study suggests that benignly managing one host species to protect
   another host species from a vector and pathogen can be effective under
   certain conditions. It also highlights the importance of understanding
   the ecological complexity of a system, in order to target control

Abstract = {{Questions: How can SDMs be adopted as a tool for forest management
   planning? Based on presence-absence data, which modelling techniques are
   appropriate to determine species potential distribution for forest
   management planning under climate change? Do species distribution models
   (SDMs) agree with expert knowledge about species distribution and
   species traits? How can forest researcher deal with distribution data of
   a species whose distribution is heavily affected by human impacts?
   Location: Bavaria (Southern Germany).
   Methods: We used SDMs based on the Second National Forest Inventory from
   2002 (4 x 4 km grid) containing presence-absence data of tree species to
   identify species environment relationships ('Grinnellian niche'). As an
   example, the distribution of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) was modelled.
   Site condition data of the plots were derived from solar radiation,
   climate and soil maps. Models applied were boosted regression trees
   (BRT) and generalised additive models (GAM). Model predictions were
   compared with an expert based evaluation of the potential natural
   vegetation and were run with a climate change scenario (WETTREG B1) to
   project future distribution of silver fir.
   Results: Both models discriminated well between presence and absence of
   silver fir but underestimated the potential distribution. The BRT model
   was more sensitive to local site conditions in the present data, but the
   GAM showed more generality. The truncated response curves and high
   uncertainties of predictions at the edge of the site spectrum indicated
   a low data density and that the data did not cover the whole niche space
   of silver fir. As indicated by validation with expert knowledge, the
   model output approached potential distribution by optimizing true
   positive predictions. The classification of SDMs output into risk
   classes allowed model evaluation and interpretation. Predictions of GAM
   and BRT under the climate change scenario showed high accordance and
   therefore, low uncertainty. Finally, large areas of Bavaria are
   described to have a high risk of silver fir cultivation in future.
   Conclusions: SDMs are especially interesting as a decision basis for
   forest management because some of the general limitations of static
   modelling approaches are not relevant in this context. Limitations of
   forest inventory data can be partially overcome by using information on
   the potential distribution of species. The transferability of the models
   to future scenarios strongly depends on the spectrum and range of the
   training data sets and the depicted functional relationships. In order
   to improve the models and reduce the uncertainties, we need to improve
   the soil data and cover the whole niche space of silver fir.}},

Abstract = {{Indicator kriging is widely used for mapping spatial binary variables
   and for estimating the global and local spatial distributions of
   variables in geosciences. For continuous random variables, indicator
   kriging gives an estimate of the cumulative distribution function, for a
   given threshold, which is then the estimate of a probability. Like any
   other kriging procedure, indicator kriging provides an estimation
   variance that, although not often used in applications, should be taken
   into account as it assesses the uncertainty of the estimate. An
   alternative approach to indicator estimation is proposed in this paper.
   In this alternative approach the complete probability density function
   of the indicator estimate is evaluated. The procedure is described in a
   Bayesian framework, using a multivariate Gaussian likelihood and an a
   priori distribution which are both combined according to Bayes theorem
   in order to obtain a posterior distribution for the indicator estimate.
   From this posterior distribution, point estimates, interval estimates
   and uncertainty measures can be obtained. Among the point estimates, the
   median of the posterior distribution is the maximum entropy estimate
   because there is a fifty-fifty chance of the unknown value of the
   estimate being larger or smaller than the median; that is, there is
   maximum uncertainty in the choice between two alternatives. Thus in some
   sense, the latter is an indicator estimator, alternative to the kriging
   estimator, that includes its own uncertainty. On the other hand, the
   mode of the posterior distribution estimator, assuming a uniform prior,
   is coincidental with the simple kriging estimator. Additionally, because
   the indicator estimate can be considered as a two-part composition which
   domain of definition is the simplex, the method is extended to
   compositional Bayesian indicator estimation. Bayesian indicator
   estimation and compositional Bayesian indicator estimation are
   illustrated with an environmental case study in which the probability of
   the content of a geochemical element in soil being over a particular
   threshold is of interest. The computer codes and its user guides are
   public domain and freely available.}},

Abstract = {{Novel physical and chemical conditions of many modern ecosystems
   increasingly diverge from the environments known to have existed at any
   time in the history of Earth. The loss of natural land to urbanization
   is one of the most prevalent drivers of novel environments in
   freshwaters. However, current understanding of aquatic community
   response to urbanization is based heavily upon aggregate indicators of
   community structure and linear or wedge-shaped community response models
   that challenge ecological community theory. We applied a new analytical
   method, threshold indicator taxa analysis (TITAN), to a stream
   biomonitoring data set from Maryland to explicitly evaluate linear
   community response models to urbanization that implicitly assume
   individual taxa decline or increase at incrementally different levels of
   urbanization. We used TITAN (1) to identify the location and magnitude
   of greatest change in the frequency and abundance of individual taxa and
   (2) to assess synchrony in the location of change points as evidence for
   stream community thresholds in response to percent impervious cover in
   catchments. We documented clear and synchronous threshold declines of
   110 of 238 macroinvertebrate taxa in response to low levels of
   impervious cover. Approximately 80\% of the declining taxa did so
   between; similar to 0.5\% and 2\% impervious cover, whereas the last
   20\% declined sporadically from; similar to 2\% to 25\% impervious
   cover. Synchrony of individual responses resulted in distinct
   community-level thresholds ranging from <= 0.68\% (mountains), 1.28\%
   (piedmont), and 0.96\% (coastal plain) impervious cover. Upper limits
   (95\% confidence intervals) of community thresholds were <2\% cover in
   all regions. Within distinct physiographic classes, higher-gradient,
   smaller catchments required less impervious cover than lower gradient,
   larger catchments to elicit community thresholds. Relatively few taxa
   showed positive responses to increasing impervious cover, and those that
   did gradually increased in frequency and abundance, approximating a
   linear cumulative distribution. The sharp, synchronous declines of
   numerous taxa established a consistent threshold response at
   exceptionally low levels of catchment urbanization, and uncertainty
   regarding the estimation of impervious cover from satellite data was
   mitigated by several corroborating lines of evidence. We suggest that
   threshold responses of communities to urban and other novel
   environmental gradients may be more prevalent than currently recognized.}},

Abstract = {{Natal dispersal is a key life history trait for the evolution and
   adaptation of wild populations. Although its evolution has repeatedly
   been related to the social and environmental context faced by
   individuals, parent-offspring regressions have also highlighted a
   possible heritable component. In this study, we explore heritability of
   natal dispersal, at the scale of the sub-Antarctic Possession Island,
   for a large-scale foraging seabird, the Wandering albatross Diomedea
   exulans, exploiting a pedigree spanning over four decades and a maximum
   of four generations. The comparison of three different methods shows
   that heritability on the liability scale can vary drastically depending
   on the type of model (heritability from 6\% to 86\%), with a notable
   underestimation by restricted maximum likelihood animal models (6\%)
   compared to Bayesian animal models (36\%). In all cases, however, our
   results point to significant additive genetic variance in the individual
   propensity to disperse, after controlling for substantial effects of sex
   and natal colony. These results reveal promising evolutionary potential
   for short-scale natal dispersal, which could play a critical role for
   the long-term persistence of this species on the long run.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Many previous studies revealed a high ability of mushrooms
   to accumulate heavy metals from environment. This paper concerns the
   capacity of some wild macromycetes belonging to Russula genus to
   accumulate heavy metals in natural condition of pH (between 6.5 and 6.8)
   and the pattern of metal translocation in the fruiting body.
   Materials and methods The studied Russula species are Russula virescens,
   Russula cyanoxantha, Russula foetens, and Russula nigrescens, which were
   harvested from forestry ecosystem from South Romania. The metal
   concentration in mushrooms and their substrate was established by EDXRF
   method.
   Results and discussion The concentrations of iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and
   copper (Cu) in the fruiting body depends on species and vary between
   58.83-340.34, 19.70-99.62, and 5.03-9.37 mg/kg for Fe, Zn, and Cu,
   respectively. The bioaccumulation factor has subunit values for the
   three studied trace metals, which show the low capacity of these species
   of mushrooms to accumulate metals if the concentrations in soil increase
   over the normal threshold for these elements. The high values of
   translocation factor demonstrate the mobility of Fe, Zn, and Cu in the
   studied mushrooms.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pollinosis is found more frequently in urban areas than in
   rural environments. This could be partly related to the different types
   of pollen exposure in these dissimilar areas. The objective of this
   study was to compare the distribution of pollen in these environments
   across an urbanization gradient.
   Methods: Daily pollen abundances were obtained in France using
   Hirst-type sensors. Sampling was conducted from January to June in 2003
   and 2006 in a rural area, a semi-rural area and in two urban areas,
   which were characterized by several urbanization criteria.
   Results: Total allergenic pollen abundance was higher in rural and
   semi-rural areas than in urban areas irrespective of the sampling year.
   Multivariate analyses showed that pollen exposures differed according to
   the type of area and were strongly explained by the urbanization
   gradient. Grass, ash, birch, alder, hornbeam, hazel and plantain pollen
   quantities exceeded the allergy threshold more often in rural settings
   than in urban areas. In urban areas, only plane pollen quantities
   exceeded the allergy threshold more often than in rural areas.
   Conclusions: Allergenic pollen exposure is higher in rural areas than in
   urban areas, and the most abundant pollen in each area did not
   originated from the same taxa. This result should be taken into account
   in epidemiological studies comparing allergies in rural and urban areas
   to adapt the panel of pollen extracts for human environmental exposure.
   In addition, this study highlights that some ornamental trees produce a
   large number of allergenic pollens and provide new sources of
   aeroallergens. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring forest tree biomass is becoming a very important issue due to
   the general environmental awareness motivated by global warming and
   climate change. However, weighing a tree is a very complicated,
   expensive, and destructive process. The tree is divided into several
   parts, and the total weight is obtained by adding the weight of the
   different components. The biomass information of a forest is obtained
   using statistical models, but one of the main difficulties is that the
   additivity property is not generally satisfied, i.e., when adding the
   predicted weights for the different tree components, the result does not
   match up with the total weight predicted for the tree. In this work,
   alternative methods for obtaining biomass predictions satisfying the
   additivity property are analyzed. In particular, segmented regression
   models with a common break point and penalized splines with the same
   smoothing parameter achieve the additivity property without any further
   adjustments. Some classical models will be also used for comparison
   purposes. Results are illustrated with real data from a beech forest

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Lead exposure remains a public health concern due to its
   serious adverse effects, such as cognitive and behavioral impairment:
   children younger than six years of age being the most vulnerable
   population. In Europe, the lead-related economic impacts have not been
   examined in detail. We estimate the annual costs in France due to
   childhood exposure and, through a cost benefit analysis (CBA), aim to
   assess the expected social and economic benefits of exposure abatement.
   Methods: Monetary benefits were assessed in terms of avoided national
   costs. We used results from a 2008 survey on blood-lead (B-Pb)
   concentrations in French children aged one to six years old. Given the
   absence of a threshold concentration being established, we performed a
   sensitivity analysis assuming different hypothetical threshold values
   for toxicity above 15 mu g/L, 24 mu g/L and 100 mu g/L. Adverse health
   outcomes of lead exposure were translated into social burden and
   economic costs based on literature data from literature. Direct health
   benefits, social benefits and intangible avoided costs were included.
   Costs of pollutant exposure control were partially estimated in regard
   to homes lead-based paint decontamination, investments aiming at
   reducing industrial lead emissions and removal of all lead drinking
   water pipes.
   Results: The following overall annual benefits for the three
   hypothetical thresholds values in 2008 are: (sic)22.72 billion,
   (sic)10.72 billion and (sic)0.44 billion, respectively. Costs from
   abatement ranged from (sic)0.9 billion to 2.95 billion/year. Finally,
   from a partial CBA of lead control in soils and dust the estimates of
   total net benefits were (sic) 3.78 billion, (sic) 1.88 billion and
   (sic)0.25 billion respectively for the three hypothesized B-Pb effect
   values.
   Conclusions: Prevention of childhood lead exposure has a high social
   benefit, due to reduction of B-Pb concentrations to levels below 15 mu
   g/L or 24 mu g/L, respectively. Reducing only exposures above 100 mu g/L
   B-Pb has little economic impact due to the small number of children who
   now exhibit such high exposure levels. Prudent public policies would
   help avoiding future medical interventions, limit the need for special
   education and increase future productivity, and hence lifetime income
   for children exposed to lead.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been related
   to respiratory health effects, but have generally been assessed
   individually without taking into account the fact that such pollutants
   are highly correlated to one other.
   Aims: We investigated the effects of exposure to various VOC, and
   considered their combined effect on adult asthma and rhinitis.
   Method: A national cross-sectional representative survey conducted by
   the Indoor Air Quality Observatory objectively assessed 20 VOCs in 490
   main dwellings in France. A standardized questionnaire determined the
   prevalence of asthma and rhinitis among 1012 inhabitants of the
   dwellings ( >= 15 years). Marginal models for binary outcome were used
   to relate VOCs exposure to asthma and rhinitis, controlling for
   potential confounders. A global score representing the number of VOCs in
   each dwelling with an elevated concentration (using the 3(rd) quartile
   value of the distribution as a threshold value) was then derived as a
   measure of the combined effect of VOCs. Specific scores were built using
   a similar approach, grouping VOCs by family.
   Results: Asthma (8.6\%) was significantly associated with N-undecane and
   1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and rhinitis (38.3\%) with ethylbenzene,
   trichloroethylene, m/p- and o-xylene. The global VOC score was
   associated with a significant risk of asthma and rhinitis (odds ratio
   (OR) of 1.40 and 1.22, respectively, for 5 additional VOCs with high
   exposure level). Both specific scores for aromatic hydrocarbons and
   aliphatic hydrocarbons were associated with a significantly risk of
   asthma (OR = 1.12; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.24 and OR =
   1.41; 95\% CI = 1.03-1.93, respectively). The specific VOC score for
   halogenated hydrocarbons was associated with a significant risk of
   rhinitis (OR = 1.28; 95\% CI: 1.07-1.54).
   Conclusion: We have shown that high concentrations of VOCs in homes were
   associated with an increasing prevalence of asthma and rhinitis in
   adults. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The development of Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) is one of the
   remaining challenges for a better protection of aquatic biodiversity and
   in particular sediment dwelling organisms. So far, sediment quality
   assessment in Flanders was based on a comparison of chemical
   concentrations to the geometric mean of the concentrations at 12
   reference sites. The study described in this paper addressed the need
   for more science-based guidelines. The developed guidelines are already
   incorporated into Flemish legislation.
   Based on a large sediment monitoring database, containing
   physico-chemical properties, concentrations of chemicals, macrobenthic
   community assemblages and ecotoxicological data, Sediment Effect
   Concentrations (SECs) were calculated as basis for the SQGs. The derived
   SECs were based on ecological effects, namely Lowest and Severe Effect
   Levels (LEL/SEL), as well as ecotoxicological endpoints, namely
   Threshold and Probable Effect Levels (TEL/PEL). The average values of
   the ecological and ecotoxicological SECs were used to distinguish five
   sediment quality classes.
   The ecological values were in general less stringent than the
   ecotoxicological values. However, the Lowest Effect Levels (95\% of the
   benthic taxa can be present under this level) and Threshold Effect
   Levels (no toxic effect is expected under this level) did not differ
   significantly. Probable Effect Levels (concentrations above this level
   will certainly result in toxic effects) were generally lower than the
   Severe Effect Levels (above this level only 5\% or less of the taxa are
   present). The SECs calculated in this study enabled us to correctly
   identify 87.9\% of the sediments as toxic. The development of SQGs based
   on a combination of the LEL/SEL and TEL/PEL methods enabled us to
   underpin these SQGs based on field observations and will improve the
   assessment of sediment quality based on chemical parameters. Although
   sediments typically contain complex mixtures of contaminants, only a
   limited number of these contaminants will be measured. Additional
   application of bioassays for the overall sediment quality assessment is
   therefore recommended.
   This study describes the development of SQGs in Flanders, which are
   based on ecological and ecotoxicological data derived from a TRIAD
   monitoring network. The combination of the LEL and PEL resulted in SQGs
   that were recently incorporated in Flemish legislation and for which the
   respective pore water concentrations were in the same order of magnitude
   as the Annual Average Environmental Quality Standards values for Water
   Framework Directive priority pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{Coal fire burning around the world is an environmental catastrophe
   characterized by the emission of noxious gases, particulate matter, and

   fire zones are extracted by Jenks' natural breaks and threshold methods

   from 1989 to 2008. The results are summarized as follows: 1) The coal
   fire temperature retrieval method based on Landsat 5 TM and the GSCA
   model is effective and feasible, because the temperature error is
   relatively small (from -2.9A degrees C to +2.6A degrees C) between the
   measured temperature and the retrieved temperature. 2) The accuracy is
   relatively high to extract coal fire zones through the Jenks' natural
   breaks and threshold methods, because 83.56\% of surveyed area is
   located in the coal fire zones extracted in 2005. 3) The coal fire area
   increased 9.81 x 10(5) m(2) from 1989 to 2005, and the annual growth is

Abstract = {{Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), a representative perfluorinated
   surfactant, is an anthropogenic pollutant detected in various
   environmental and biological matrices. Some laboratory and field work
   has been conducted to assess the aquatic toxicity of PFOS, but little is
   known regarding its toxicity threshold to the aquatic ecosystem. In the
   present study, predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) were derived
   by four different approaches. The interspecies correlation estimation
   (ICE) program and final acute-to-chronic ratio (FACR) were applied to
   the development of PNEC based on the toxic mode of action (MOA) of PFOS.
   By comparison of the different PNECs, the recommended aquatic toxicity
   thresholds for PFOS are in the range of 0.61 to 6.66 mu g/L. Based on
   comparison of PNEC values, microcosm results, and reported environmental
   concentrations, PFOS appears not to pose a serious threat to aquatic
   organisms. The present results demonstrate that MOA is an important
   consideration for the derivation of reliable PNECs; moreover, the
   ICE-based species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method can be used to
   derive PNECs when toxicological data are limited. The application of MOA
   and ICE for deriving PNEC values in the present study may facilitate
   studies on using a combination of quantitative structure activity

Abstract = {{Aim
   Using dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) in a
   tropical land-bridge island system, we test for the small island effect
   (SIE) in the species-area relationship and evaluate its effects on
   species richness and community composition. We also examine the
   determinants of species richness across island size and investigate the
   traits of dung beetle species in relation to their local extinction
   vulnerability following forest fragmentation.
   Location
   Lake Kenyir, a hydroelectric reservoir in north-eastern Peninsular
   Malaysia.
   Methods
   We sampled dung beetles using human dung baited pitfall traps on 24
   land-bridge islands and three mainland sites. We used regression tree
   analyses to test for the SIE, as well as species traits related to local
   rarity, as an indication of extinction vulnerability. We employed
   generalized linear models (GLMs) to examine determinants for species
   richness at different scales and compared the results with those from
   conventional linear and breakpoint regressions. Community analyses
   included non-metric multidimensional scaling, partial Mantel tests,
   nestedness analysis and abundance spectra.
   Results
   Regression tree analysis revealed an area threshold at 35.8 ha
   indicating an SIE. Tree basal area was the most important predictor of
   species richness on small islands (< 35.8 ha). Results from GLMs
   supported these findings, with isolation and edge index also being
   important for small islands. The SIE also manifested in patterns of dung
   beetle community composition where communities on small islands (< 35.8
   ha) departed from those on the mainland and larger islands, and were
   highly variable with no significant nestedness, probably as a result of
   unexpected species occurrences on several small islands. The communities
   exhibited a low degree of spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that
   dispersal limitation plays a part in structuring dung beetle
   assemblages. Species with lower baseline density and an inability to
   forage on the forest edge were found to be rarer among sites and hence
   more prone to local extinction.
   Main conclusions
   We highlight the stochastic nature of dung beetle community composition
   on small islands and argue that this results in reduced ecosystem
   functionality. A better understanding of the minimum fragment size
   required for retaining functional ecological communities will be
   important for effective conservation management and the maintenance of
   tropical forest ecosystem stability.}},

Abstract = {{An indicator framework was designed as an operational science-based tool
   for the evaluation of the environmental aspects of sustainable forest
   management at stand level in Flanders (Belgium). The framework aims to
   assess the effects of forest management on forest composition, structure
   and functioning. It consists of seven principles and 19 criteria, to
   which 157 potential indicators, selected from literature, were assigned;
   40 of these were considered as suitable by an expert panel, based on 10
   operational selection criteria. All indicators were quantitative
   variables measurable in the field.
   After elaboration of a measurement protocol, the indicator framework was
   validated in 115 forest stands, distributed over the three main forest
   types of Flanders. The new indicator framework exhibited greater
   sensitivity to forest management practices and demonstrated better
   discriminating power than the method that is currently used by the
   Flemish forest administration to estimate the naturalness and
   environmental quality of a forest stand. Following a detailed cost
   calculation of each indicator and based on the sensitivity of each
   indicator to forest management practices, the indicator framework was
   further reduced to a final set of 29 indicators. This framework can also
   be applied in other regions, provided that local threshold values are
   defined to convert indicator values to indicator scores.
   The selection procedure and the possible contribution of this set to the

Abstract = {{Regionally mandated budgets often ignore important sub-regional
   differences. To help identify hot-spots, where environmental pressures
   and agricultural activities combine and heighten the need to optimise
   farming strategies, we recommend using detailed spatial target analysis.
   In this paper, we propose a methodology for identifying different
   agro-environments, test that method in a case-study territory in the
   western Po River plain (the largest and most intensive agricultural area
   in Italy), and then calculate the nutrient budget indicators of these
   defined agro-environments as a means to assess environmental
   sustainability.
   We identified five Macro Land Units (MLUs) representing five different
   agro-environments from official datasets and territorial surveys,
   detected and quantified land use, crop productivity, and fertilisation
   management in these MLUs, and calculated nutrient budgets according to
   the IRENA European methodology. As expected, the highest nutrient
   surpluses (103, 39, and 95 kg ha(-1) for N, P. and K, respectively) were
   detected in the most intensely managed area. N surpluses were attributed
   to excess mineral inputs and P surpluses to excess organic inputs. At
   the territorial scale, the manure N load was far below the 170 kg ha(-1)
   threshold; at the crop scale, maize showed the least-optimised
   fertilisation management.
   This work suggests that GIS-based analysis of environmental pressures of
   agricultural activities at a sub-regional level is useful for
   identifying areas and crops for which fertilization must be well
   managed. The proposed methodology depends on accurate collection and
   collation of farm data into GIS databases; public authorities should
   promote investment in planning and managing data collection in
   agriculture. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological thresholds are abrupt changes of ecological state. While an
   ecological threshold is a widely accepted concept, most empirical
   methods detect them in time or across geographic space. Although useful,
   these approaches do not quantify the direct drivers of threshold
   response. Causal understanding of thresholds detected empirically
   requires their investigation in a multi-factor domain containing the
   direct drivers (often referred to as state space). Here, we present an
   approach to quantify thresholds from response surfaces modeled
   empirically in state space. We present two indices of shape attributes
   measured from response surfaces. The response surfaces are built using a
   regression method in state space. The indices are threshold strength (T)
   and diagonality (D). We use 48 simulated response surfaces of different
   shapes to test the efficacy of the indices in 3D. Our results show that
   T is sensitive to the steepness of the transition from one state to the
   next, with various forms of abrupt, centralized thresholds yielding the
   highest values among the simulated surfaces. D represents the
   orientation of the response surface or the simultaneous influence of
   more than one predictor in eliciting the response gradient. Strongly
   diagonal surfaces have the most diagonal surface area demonstrated by
   sharply undulating diagonal surfaces. Given that the success of T and D
   requires a regression method to accurately capture any shape of complex
   data structure, we also test the accuracy of empirical regression
   methods known to be tractable with complex data. We test classification
   and regression trees (CART), Random Forest, and non-parametric
   multiplicative regression (NPMR) for binary and continuous responses. We
   use the 48 simulated response surfaces to test the methods, and we find
   that prediction accuracy depends on both the T and D of the simulated
   data for each method. We choose the most accurate method among those we
   test for capturing any shape of response surface from real data, NPMR.
   Finally, we use NPMR to build response surfaces and quantify T and D
   from real ecological data sets. We demonstrate how measuring threshold
   strength and diagonality from multi-factor response surfaces can advance
   ecology. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Crown fire endangers fire fighters and can have severe ecological
   consequences. Prediction of fire behavior in tree crowns is essential to
   informed decisions in fire management. Current methods used in fire
   management do not address variability in crown fuels. New mechanistic
   physics-based fire models address convective heat transfer with
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and can be used to model fire in
   heterogeneous crown fuels. However, the potential impacts of variability
   in crown fuels on fire behavior have not yet been explored. In this
   study we describe a new model, FUEL3D, which incorporates the pipe model
   theory (PMT) and a simple 3D recursive branching approach to model the
   distribution of fuel within individual tree crowns. FUEL3D uses forest
   inventory data as inputs, and stochastically retains geometric
   variability observed in field data. We investigate the effects of crown
   fuel heterogeneity on fire behavior with a CFD fire model by simulating
   fire under a homogeneous tree crown and a heterogeneous tree crown
   modeled with FUEL3D, using two different levels of surface fire
   intensity. Model output is used to estimate the probability of tree
   mortality, linking fire behavior and fire effects at the scale of an
   individual tree. We discovered that variability within a tree crown
   altered the timing, magnitude and dynamics of how fire burned through
   the crown; effects varied with surface fire intensity. In the lower
   surface fire intensity case, the heterogeneous tree crown barely ignited
   and would likely survive, while the homogeneous tree had nearly 80\%
   fuel consumption and an order of magnitude difference in total net
   radiative heat transfer. In the higher surface fire intensity case, both
   cases burned readily. Differences for the homogeneous tree between the
   two surface fire intensity cases were minimal but were dramatic for the
   heterogeneous tree. These results suggest that heterogeneity within the
   crown causes more conditional, threshold-like interactions with fire. We

   Review and discussion of conceptual models and applied literature,

   Results and Conclusions
   We propose to enhance the STM considering two principal axes: (a) the x
   axis determined by structural ecosystem changes (vegetation and soil)
   and (b) the y axis determined by ecosystem functions and/or processes
   (recruitment, rain use efficiency). These axes define what we will call
   Structural-Functional State and Transition Model (SFSTM). Both axes of
   SFSTM make it possible to determine and quantify states and transitions,
   critical thresholds and to evaluate the resistance and resilience of an
   ecosystem to a given disturbance. The critical threshold is identified
   by structural and functional thresholds (x and y axes), thus defining
   the point where the ecosystem loses its resilience. Furthermore, in the
   supplementary file we provide examples with field data from Patagonia to
   illustrate the SFSTM. The proposed SFSTM has large implications for
   rangeland research and management, facilitating the understanding and
   integration of key concepts to enhance the STM. The identification of
   variables to assess structure and processes makes the model more useful.}},

   version of the ASTM 1644 standard for Pb, which prescribes a hot nitric
   acid/hydrogen peroxide digestion. The key modification was the addition
   of hydrofluoric acid to improve recoveries of the target elements, and
   determination using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry
   (ICP-MS). Generally, a large proportion of the results fell below the
   limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ). To distinguish
   ``elevated'' metal loadings from loadings characterized as ``urban
   background'', an upper background threshold for each element was derived
   using a normality (Q-Q) plot. LOQ was determined to be the appropriate
   minimum threshold based on quality assurance criteria. It is concluded
   that wipes are a useful sampling option to investigate multi-element
   loadings in residential environments.}},

Abstract = {{The ecotoxicological characterization of waste is part of its assessment
   as hazardous or non-hazardous according to the European Waste List. For
   this classification 15 hazard criteria are derived from the Council
   Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste. Some of the hazard criteria are
   based on the content of dangerous substances. The criterion H14
   `ecotoxic' lacks of an assessment and testing strategy and no specific
   threshold values have been defined so far. Based on the recommendations
   of CEN guideline 14735 (2005), an international round robin test (ring
   test) was organized by the German Federal Environment Agency in order to
   define suitable test methods for the biological assessment of waste and
   waste eluates. A basic test battery, consisting of three aquatic and
   three terrestrial tests, was compiled. In addition, data were submitted
   for ten additional tests (five aquatic (including a genotoxicity test)
   and five terrestrial ones). The tests were performed with three
   representative waste types: an ash from an incineration plant, a soil
   containing high concentrations of organic contaminants (polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons) and a preserved wood waste. The results of this
   ring test confirm that a combination of a battery of biological tests
   and chemical residual analysis is needed for an ecotoxicological
   characterization of wastes. With small modifications the basic test
   battery is considered to be well suitable for the hazard and risk
   assessment of wastes and waste eluates. All results and documents are
   accessible via a web-based data bank application.}},

Abstract = {{Corsica island has been subjected to an unprecedented abundance of
   photovoltaic plant projects since its energy policy is focused on
   renewable resources. Concerned public institutions require specific
   tools to select the most relevant projects among numerous projects
   proposed in a transparent and prudent way.
   To this end, a multicriteria decision aiding method was developed to
   select among 16 projects that have been proposed on farming fields in
   Haute Corse. This paper details the main stages in the multicriteria
   methodology, including criteria and constraint definition, criteria
   weight set calculations, threshold and concordance level determination
   and the implementation of the chosen multicriteria model, ELECTRE IS.
   Thus, considering different points of view (energy, geo-economic,
   ecological, visual impact, territorial use, financial effect), eight
   criteria have been defined, one of which is optional. The method applied
   to the reviewed data allowed building 6 weight sets, while a concordance
   level of 2/3. Using this method, based on our criteria sets and
   according to the weights and concordance levels determined by the

Abstract = {{Background: Many poor in developing countries have turned to artisanal
   small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in an attempt to improve their situation.
   However, the mercury used to extract gold from ore is discharged in
   vaporized form into the environment, where it poses a hazard for human
   health.
   Methods: As part of an environmental epidemiological study in Mongolia
   to evaluate the burden of environmental mercury contamination urine,
   blood and hair samples were collected from residents of areas with or
   without mercury contamination. A total of 200 blood, urine and hair
   samples were analyzed for mercury and divided into three subgroups
   according to mercury content: (1) occupational exposure (high/medium);
   (2) environmental exposure (low); and (3) no exposure. Internal mercury
   distributions of the subgroups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis
   and Mann-Whitney U-test. The Chi-square test and likelihood ratio
   proportion were used to compare the findings with threshold limits.
   Results: The highest values and greatest differences were seen in the
   urine samples (p<0.001, Kruskal-Wallis). The occupational group showing
   the highest exposure with a median mercury level of 4.36 mu g/l (control
   group: 0.10 mu g/l, p<0.001), 7.18 mu g/g creatinine and 12 results
   above the threshold limit HBM I (Human Biomonitoring I). Even
   participants from the low-exposure subgroup showed elevated mercury
   levels (median 2.88 mu g/l urine and 2.98 mu g/g creatinine, p<0.001),
   with 10 individuals above the HBM I threshold limits.
   Discussion: The body burden resulting from the use of mercury in
   artisanal gold mining is high not only in the miners themselves, an
   increased mercury hazard was also found for inhabitants of mining areas
   who were not actively involved in mining. Public health support measures
   are urgently needed to alleviate the situation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

   The cosatal zone has always been the most developed region, with dense
   population and many cities; also, it is the ecologically-fragile area,
   which is very sensitive to climate change. In this paper, the climate
   change in Jiaodong Peninsula, China was analyzed by the non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test, Accumulated Difference Curve and Order Cluster
   Analysis methods, based upon the temperature and precipitation data over
   the past 50 years. Results obtained showed a number of observations: (1)
   The annual mean temperature of Jiaodong Peninsula showed a significant
   increasing trend, with a distinct abrupt change point detected around
   1990, during the past 5 decades. The warming of Jiaodong Peninsula over
   the last 50 years was due mainly to the significant increase of annual
   minimum temperature. (2)The annual precipitation exhibited a decreasing
   trend during the past 5 decades, with an abrupt change detected around
   1980 at most stations; there was an earlier transition point at 1966, at
   a few stations. The reduction in precipitation, from June to September,
   was responsible mainly for the decrease of annual precipitation. (3)The
   temperature evolution in Jiaodong Peninsula was basically consistent
   with most parts of the world, but warmed at a faster rate over the same
   period; the decreasing trend of precipitation was more significant.
   Within the Peninsula, the southeastern part has earlier transition
   points of temperature and precipitation, as well as larger reduction of
   precipitation than the northwest. This research was of great importance
   to understand the climate change and its environmental effects in the
   coastal zone.}},

Abstract = {{Organochlorine (OC) residues were analysed in 117 sediment samples
   collected from four bays of the Uganda side of Lake Victoria. The
   sediments were collected with a corer at a depth of 0-20 cm, and

   were cleaned using gel permeation chromatography and analysed for
   pesticide residues using a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with an
   electron capture detector. The results were confirmed using a GC
   equipped with a mass spectrometer (MS). A total of 16 OC residues, most
   of them persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were identified and
   quantified. The OC residue levels were expressed on an oven dry weight
   (d.w.) basis. Endosulphan sulphate, in the range of 0.82-5.62 mu g

Abstract = {{Aim
   To describe species-area relationships in human settlements and compare
   them with those from a non-urban habitat.
   Location
   West-central Mexico.
   Methods
   We surveyed breeding birds in 13 human settlements and five shrubland
   patches. We estimated bird species richness using an abundance-based
   coverage estimator with equal sample sizes to eliminate biases related
   to sampling effort differences. To assess species-area relationships, we
   performed log-log linear regressions between the size of the studied
   patches and their estimated bird richness. We also used a logarithmic
   approach to determine how the species-area relationship asymptoted and
   made use of the Michaelis-Menten model to identify the size at which the
   studied patches reached their maximum species richness. We also
   investigated (1) possible relationships among the estimated bird
   richness and other variables known to affect urban-dwelling birds (built
   cover, plant species richness, tree cover or human population density)
   and (2) changes in bird community composition related to the size of the
   studied human settlements.
   Results
   Species-area relationships exhibited different patterns among the
   studied habitats. The log-log regression slope was steeper in human
   settlements, while the intercept was higher in shrublands. The maximum
   number of species was more than twofold higher in shrublands. Human
   settlement patch size was the only variable significantly related to
   bird richness. Our community composition results show that two main bird
   groups are related to human settlement size, and that as the size of
   human settlements increases, bird community similarity in relation to
   the largest city increases.
   Main conclusions
   Human settlements act as ecological islands, with pronounced
   species-area relationships. Our results suggest that an important
   threshold for bird species richness and community composition is reached
   in human settlements > 10.2 km2. This threshold is unlikely to be
   generalizable among bio-regions, and thus should be quantified and
   considered when studying, managing and/or planning urban systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background: An association between cadmium exposure and bone mineral
   density (BMD) has been demonstrated in elderly women, but has not been
   well studied in youths and men. Some studies report either no or a weak
   association between cadmium exposure and bone damage.
   Objectives: This study was designed to investigate the relationship
   between the urinary cadmium (U-Cd) levels and BMD of females and males
   of all ages.
   Methods: A total of 804 residents near an industrial complex were
   surveyed in 2007. U-Cd and BMD on the heel (non-dominant calcaneus) were
   analyzed with AAS-GTA and Dual-Energy X-ray absorptiometry,
   respectively. Demographic characteristics were collected by structured
   questionnaires. Osteoporosis and osteopenia were defined by BMD cut-off
   values and T-scores set by the WHO; T score > -1, normal; -2.5 < T score
   < -1, osteopenia; and T score < -2.5, osteoporosis. Logistic and
   multiple linear regressions were applied to estimate the association
   between U-Cd levels and BMD.
   Results: The U-Cd levels in females (0.64 mu g/g creatinine) were higher
   than those in males (0.48 mu g/g creatinine) (p < 0.001). With the
   logistic regression model, osteopenia was associated with high U-Cd
   levels (>= 1.0 mu g/g creatinine) in females (OR = 2.92; 95\% CI,
   1.51-5.64) and in males (OR = 3.37; 95\% CI, 1.09-10.38). With the
   multiple linear regression model, the BMD of the adult group was
   negatively associated with U-Cd (< 0.05), gender (female, p < 0.001) and
   age (p < 0.001). The BMD of participants who were < 19 years of age was
   negatively associated with gender (female, p < 0.01), whereas it was
   positively associated with age and BMI (p < 0.001). BMD was not
   associated with exercise, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, job or
   parental education.
   Conclusion: Results suggested that U-Cd might be associated with
   osteopenia as well as osteoporosis in both male and female adults. Age
   and female gender were negatively associated with BMD in the adult
   group, whereas age was positively associated with BMD in the youth
   group. Cadmium exposure may be a potential risk factor for lower-BMD and
   osteopenia symptoms as well as for osteoporosis symptoms. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Aim
   The proportion of sampled sites where a species is present is known as
   prevalence. Empirical studies have shown that prevalence can affect the

   simulated species data to examine how prevalence and the form of species
   environmental dependence affect the assessment of the predictive
   performance of models.
   Methods
   Simulated species data were based on various functions of simulated
   environmental data with differing degrees of spatial correlation. Seven
   model performance measures - sensitivity, specificity, class-average
   (CA), overall prediction success, kappa (kappa), normalized mutual
   information (NMI) and area under the receiver operating characteristic
   curve (AUC) - were applied to species models fitted by three regression
   methods. The response of the performance measures to prevalence was then
   assessed. Three probability threshold selection methods used to convert
   fitted logistic model values to presence or absence were also assessed.
   Results
   The study shows that the extent to which prevalence affects model
   performance depends on the modelling technique and its degree of success
   in capturing dominant environmental determinants. It also depends on the
   statistic used to measure model performance and the probability
   threshold method. The response based on kappa generally preferred models
   with medium prevalence. All performance measures were least affected by
   prevalence when the probability threshold was chosen to maximize
   predictive performance or was based directly on prevalence. In these
   cases, the responses based on AUC, CA and NMI generally preferred models
   with small or large prevalence.
   Main conclusions
   The effect of prevalence on the predictive performance of species
   distribution models has a methodological basis. Relevant factors include
   the success of the fitted distribution model in capturing the dominant
   environmental determinant, the model performance measure and the
   probability threshold selection method. The fixed probability threshold
   method yields a marked response of model performance to prevalence and
   is therefore not recommended. The study explains previous empirical
   results obtained with real data.}},

Abstract = {{Land treatment of municipal wastewater effluent is a proven method for
   augmenting freshwater resources and avoiding direct nutrient discharges
   to surface waters. We assessed changes in soil test phosphorus (P) of
   the Ap horizon of cropped fields continuously irrigated for 26 yr with
   secondary effluent from the Penn State University wastewater treatment
   plant. For annual P additions averaging 97 kg P ha(-1), Mehlich-3 P
   (M3P) response in the 0- to 20-cm surface soil (initially <20 mg kg(-1))
   was represented by two lines. For the first 12 yr of irrigation, soil
   test P increased, with 14.5 kg P ha(-1) needed to increase M3P by 1 mg P
   kg(-1). After the initial buildup, M3P maintained a quasi-steady-state
   value of similar to 110 mg kg(-1). Over time, the surface soil
   equilibrium P concentration at zero sorption increased markedly (from <1
   to 5.5 mg P L-1), and extractable aluminum (Al) decreased significantly
   (P < 0.001). Speciation modeling using Visual MINTEQ suggests
   complexation of Al by dissolved organic carbon at site pH conditions.
   Loss of Al from the surface layer lowered its P-sorbing capacity,
   causing added effluent-P to move into the subsoil. Results suggest that
   current management practices can continue for many years without
   exceeding the surface soil M3P environmental threshold (200 mg kg(-1))
   used in state P-based nutrient policies.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{46-59}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Studies on the biogeography of host-parasitoid interactions are scarce,
   mainly because of technical difficulties associated with rearing and
   species identification. DNA barcoding is increasingly recognized as a
   valuable tool for taxon identification, allowing to link different life
   history stages of a species. We evaluate the usefulness of a protocol
   based on cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequencing for the study of
   geographical variation of host-parasitoid interactions. Larvae of
   Acroclita subsequana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) were collected in
   Macaronesia and dissected to search for parasitoid larvae. Both hosts
   and parasitoids were sequenced and assigned to molecular operational
   taxonomic units (MOTUs) based on pairwise genetic distances, tree-based
   and similarity-based methods. Hosts were grouped into six MOTUs, usually
   with an allopatric distribution, while parasitoids clustered into 12
   MOTUs, each of which was mostly found attacking a single host MOTU.
   Available COI sequence databases failed to provide identification to
   species level for these MOTUs. Three challenges related to the
   applicability of DNA barcoding in this type of studies are identified
   and discussed: (i) more suitable primers need to be developed for both
   parasitoids and hosts; (ii) the most commonly used approaches for
   inferring MOTUs have different limitations (e.g. arbitrary nature of
   defining a threshold to separate MOTUs) and need to be improved or
   replaced by other techniques; and (iii) for the identification of MOTUs,
   it is imperative to increase the range of sequenced taxa in the
   currently available reference databases. Finally, in spite of these
   difficulties, we discuss how DNA barcoding will help ecological and
   biogeographical studies of host-parasitoid interactions.}},

Journal = {{ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1275-1288}},
Abstract = {{Poland has not managed to create regulations on the odour nuisance
   assessment in spite of studies related to this issue. In many countries
   around the world e.g. in Germany, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, there
   are standards relating to odours. For several years, operates the
   European standard EN 13725 for the determination of odour concentration
   by dynamic olfactometry, and its Polish version PN-EN 13725. However,
   these standards relate to odour emission. So far, there are no similar
   standards for odour in ambient air (odour imission) and air olfactory
   quality assessment on a European scale.
   The legal basis for air quality in Germany is the Act on Protection of
   Atmospheric Air (German BImSchG: Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz).
   According to it ( 3 (1)) deterioration of the environment due to
   pollution, which, because of the nature, size and duration, can cause
   harm, serious injury or annoyance to the public. Only under this Act a
   odour nuisance as environment pollution may be viewed. Each plant
   obtaining licenses for the operation or control of already existing
   plants is obliged to assess the extent to which the possible nuisance
   can be considered as serious. So guidelines for ``Odour in the air{''}
   were developed. In these guidelines, the methods of dealing in relation
   to immission odour measurement methods and requirements for air
   olfactory quality are presented: inter alia, the limits of recognized
   odours in the areas around the industrial plants. The limit values were
   obtained basing on carried out measurements, comparative tests of the
   impact and odour frequency and level assessed on the basis of surveys in
   accordance with VDI 3883. According to GOAA (Guideline on Odour in
   Ambient Air), the smell can be characterized by its type, the level of
   feelings - above the threshold of recognition, and through the so-called
   `odour hour'.
   Lack of regulation and standardized terminology relating inter alia to
   odour measurements in the field is definitely a basic limitation when
   trying to apply methods of odour assessing in Poland. Therefore, there
   is a need to clarify the concepts of `odour imission' (odour in ambient
   air) and `survey'. The first of them allows an assessment of frequency
   of the odour occurrence, is also called `field research / inspections /
   measurements'. However, as a `survey' (questionnaires) is defined odor
   nuissance assessment. The term `field research' refers to the total
   assessment of odour with both the imission measurements and
   questionnaires.
   Currently, the only way to carry out research in and around a potential
   odour emission source is the good will of the representatives of the
   plant. However, the vast majority of traders fear field measurements,
   since the results of measurements would suggest a potential need for
   changes and improvements in technology of the industrial plant, which
   undoubtedly would impose a large financial outlay. Further restrictions
   apply to conduct research themselves. On one hand, the measurements do
   not require any complicated or expensive equipment. On the other, are
   indispensable to the people creating the panel, who should be trained
   and then perform measurements, which require financial resources.
   Another problem of a formal nature, is a law on the protection of
   personal data. Impossible or difficult access to the population database
   of potential respondents from the area could lead to a significant
   reduction in the quality of research results and their lack of
   credibility.
   However, taking into account the very complex nature of the problem of
   odour nuisance, and particularly the influence of `no olfactory'
   factors, odour evaluation process should be expanded just a survey.
   Thus, in this study modifications to the German methodology have been
   done in order to develop evaluation process of the air olfactory quality
   assessment. It has been concluded that the legislation related to odours
   should be introduced in Poland in order to improve the evaluation of the
   problem and finding the optimal deodoration solution.}},

Title = {{Not just a matter of taste: palatability of bait markers is influenced
   by the need to search for alternative food}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{596-602}},
Abstract = {{Context. Bait palatability is a key issue influencing the uptake of
   toxic baits or non-toxic bait markers. Animals often reject baits with
   high concentrations of the active compound (whether it is a toxin,
   vaccine or marker) because of poor palatability, thus reducing the
   efficacy of baiting. Foraging theory predicts that palatability will be
   affected not only by the taste of active ingredients in bait but also by
   an animal's ability to access alternative foods. Yet few studies of bait
   palatability are measured in the context of an animal's need to search
   and forage for other food types.
   Aims. The present study examined whether the palatability of Rhodamine B
   (RB) baits for black rats (Rattus rattus) was affected when foraging
   constraints were placed on access to alternative food compared with when
   alternative food was freely accessible. Rhodamine B is a bait marker and
   was used as a surrogate for other active ingredients likely to be used
   in pest control management.
   Methods. Each day, RB bait at one of four concentrations was provided to
   an individual rat along with an alternative food that was either freely
   available (spatially clumped with foraging constraints absent) or hidden
   within a matrix of tubes (spatially scattered, thus with foraging
   constraints present).
   Key results. Black rats exhibited a gradient in how palatable they found
   RB and preferred baits that contained the lowest concentrations of RB.
   Importantly, RB baits were more palatable when access to alternative
   food was made more difficult by applying a foraging constraint. In
   particular, a 0.2\% RB concentration appeared to represent a threshold
   in palatability where intake at or above this concentration was
   significantly affected by a rat's ability to freely access alternative
   foods. The ingestion of RB dye (mg kg(-1)) was highest in rats that
   consumed the highest concentrations, even though food intake was
   reduced.
   Conclusions. The consumption of baits at high RB concentrations was
   greatly affected by the ease of access to other foods. We suggest the
   willingness of the animal to consume the bait can be influenced by the
   effort needed to find alternative foods.
   Implications. A higher incidence of marking in the whiskers or hair of
   target individuals in the field will only be achieved with the use of
   the most palatable concentrations of RB and environments providing low
   alternative food access and abundance. A trade-off between reliable
   marking and palatability of RB at varying concentrations must be
   achieved if actual bait uptake in the field is to be more accurately
   represented. A re-evaluation of palatability experiments may be required
   as access to alternative foods can have profound impacts on bait uptake.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{In order for connectivity to serve as an effective diagnostic
   classification tool of hydrological behavior, it clearly matters (1) how
   it is measured and (2) whether the chosen measures are correlated not
   only to catchment-scale antecedent moisture conditions but also to
   streamflow discharges. Previous studies have advocated that connectivity
   in shallow soil moisture patterns induces threshold-like changes in
   runoff in temperate rangeland catchments but not in temperate humid
   forested catchments. We argue that in the latter environments, capturing
   critical spatial organization in soil moisture patterns depends on the
   way the chosen connectivity metric is built. We therefore tested a large
   selection of 2-D and 3-D connectivity measures in a temperate humid
   forested catchment (Laurentians, Canada). Computations were based on
   continuous soil moisture patterns collected on 16 occasions at four soil
   depths and then transformed into indicator patterns using either
   time-variable or time-invariant thresholds. Assessments of connectivity
   were variable depending on the computed metric, as just a few measures
   were significantly correlated with both antecedent moisture conditions
   and catchment discharges. In particular, topography-based connectivity
   metrics reflected changes in catchment macrostate and stormflow response
   better than omnidirectional methods. Also, source-to-stream connectivity
   metrics were more hydrologically sensitive than metrics that did not
   consider the spatial linkage to the stream channel. These conclusions
   stress the importance of searching for the right connectivity metric for
   hydrologic prediction, especially in humid forested environments that
   exhibit much larger variability in soil hydrologic properties than
   temperate rangeland catchments.}},

   images by using an anomaly detection technique}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Many methods for the detection of oil pollution on the sea surface from
   remotely sensed images have been developed in recent years. However,
   because of the diverse physical properties of oil on the sea surface in
   the visible wavelengths, such images are easily affected by the
   surrounding environment. This is a common difficulty encountered when
   optical satellite images are used as data sources for observing oil
   slicks on the sea surface. However, provided the spectral interference
   generated by the surrounding environment can be regarded as noise and
   properly modeled, the spectral anomalies caused by an oil slick on
   normal sea water may be observed after the suppression of this noise. In
   this study, sea surface oil slicks are extracted by detecting spectral
   anomalies in multispectral optical satellite images. First, assuming
   that the sea water and oil slick comprise the dominant background and
   target anomaly, respectively, an RX algorithm is used to enhance the oil
   slick anomaly. The oil slick can be distinguished from the sea water
   background after modeling and suppression of inherent noise. Next, a
   Gaussian mixture model is used to characterize the statistical
   distributions of the background and anomaly, respectively. The
   expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to obtain the parameters
   needed for the Gaussian mixture model. Finally, according to the
   Bayesian decision rule of minimum error, an optimized threshold can be
   obtained to extract the oil slick areas from the source image.
   Furthermore, with the obtained Gaussian distributions and optimized
   threshold, a theoretical false alarm level can be established to
   evaluate the quality of the extracted oil slicks. Experimental results
   show that the proposed method can not only successfully detect oil
   slicks from multispectral optical satellite images, but also provide a
   quantitative accuracy evaluation of the detected image.}},

Title = {{Assessing conservation relevance of organism-environment relations using

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{351-358}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Organism-environment models are used widely in conservation. The
   degree to which they are useful for informing conservation decisions -
   the conservation relevance of these relations - is important because
   lack of relevance may lead to misapplication of scarce conservation
   resources or failure to resolve important conservation dilemmas. Even
   when models perform well based on model fit and predictive ability,
   conservation relevance of associations may not be clear without also
   knowing the magnitude and variability of predicted changes in response
   variables.
   2. We introduce a method for evaluating the conservation relevance of
   organism-environment relations that employs confidence intervals for
   predicted changes in response variables. The confidence intervals are
   compared to a preselected magnitude of change that marks a threshold
   (trigger) for conservation action. To demonstrate the approach, we used
   a case study from the Chihuahuan Desert involving relations between
   avian richness and broad-scale patterns of shrubland. We considered
   relations for three winters and two spatial extents (1- and 2-km-radius
   areas) and compared predicted changes in richness to three thresholds
   (10\%, 20\% and 30\% change). For each threshold, we examined 48
   relations.
   3. The method identified seven, four and zero conservation-relevant
   changes in mean richness for the 10\%, 20\% and 30\% thresholds
   respectively. These changes were associated with major (20\%) changes in
   shrubland cover, mean patch size, the coefficient of variation for patch
   size, or edge density but not with major changes in shrubland patch
   density. The relative rarity of conservation-relevant changes indicated
   that, overall, the relations had little practical value for informing
   conservation decisions about avian richness.
   4. The approach we illustrate is appropriate for various response and
   predictor variables measured at any temporal or spatial scale. The
   method is broadly applicable across ecological environments,
   conservation objectives, types of statistical predictive models and
   levels of biological organization. By focusing on magnitudes of change
   that have practical significance, and by using the span of confidence
   intervals to incorporate uncertainty of predicted changes, the method
   can be used to help improve the effectiveness of conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Vinyl chloride (VC) is a known human carcinogen that is primarily formed

   Aerobic, ethene-degrading bacteria (etheneotrophs), which are capable of
   both fortuitous and growth-linked VC oxidation, could be important in
   natural attenuation of VC plume: that escape anaerobic treatment. In
   this work, we developed a quantitative, real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for
   etheneotrophs in groundwater. We designed and tested degenerate qPCR
   primers for two functional genes involved in aerobic, growth-coupled VC-
   and ethene-oxidation (etnC and etnE). Primer specificity to these target
   genes was tested by comparison to nucleotide sequence databases, PCR
   analysis of template DNA extracted from isolates and environmental
   samples, and sequencing of qPCR products obtained from VC-contaminated
   groundwater. The assay was made quantitative by constructing standard
   curves (threshold cycle vs log gene copy number) with DNA amplified from
   Mycobacterium strain JS60, an etheneotrophic isolate. Analysis of
   groundwater samples from three different VC-contaminated sites revealed
   that etnC abundance ranged from 1.6 x 10(3) - 1.0 x 10(5) copies/L
   groundwater while etnE abundance ranged from 4.3 x 10(3) - 6.3 x 10(5)

   strategies, assisting in site closure, and conducting mic robial ecology

Abstract = {{Background, aim, and scope High mountain soils constitute a long-term
   cumulative record of atmospherically deposited trace elements from both
   natural and anthropogenic sources. The main aims of this study were to
   determine the level of major and trace metals (Al, Ti, Mn, Fe, and Zr)
   of lithologic origin and airborne contaminating trace elements (Ni, Cu,
   Zn, As, Cd, and Pb) in soils in the Central Pyrenees as an indication of
   background contamination over SW Europe, to establish whether there is a
   spatial pattern of accumulation of trace elements in soils as a function
   of altitude, and to examine whether altitude-related physicochemical
   properties of soils affect the accumulation of major metals and trace
   elements.
   Methods Major metals and trace elements were measured in ``top{''}
   (i.e., first 10 cm) and ``bottom{''} (i.e., below 10 cm) soil samples
   along an altitudinal transect (1,520-2,880 m a.s.l.) in the Central
   Pyrenees. Total concentrations were determined by X-ray fluorescense
   spectrometry. Total major metal concentrations were analysed by
   conventional X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) with a Siemens SRS
   303 instrument. Total trace element concentrations were determined with
   an energy-dispersive multielement miniprobe XRF analyser.
   Acid-extractable concentrations were measured by inductively coupled
   plasma after previous extraction with nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide
   in closed beakers. Acid-extractable major metal concentrations were
   measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-Optic Emission Spectrometry
   with a Perkin Elmer 3200 RL Instrument. Acid-extractable trace element
   concentrations were determined by ICP-Mass Spectrometry with a Perkin
   Elmer ELAN 6000.
   Results Trace element concentration ranges were (in mg kg(-1),
   inventories in g m(-2) between parenthesis) < 2-58 (0.5-6.6) for Ni,
   6-30 (0.2-3.4) for Cu, 38-236 (1.6-32.4) for Zn, 6-209 (0.2-12.8) for
   As, 0.02-0.64 (< 0.04) for Cd, and 28-94 (0.6-13.0) for Pb. These
   concentrations were, in general, comparable to those recorded in soils
   from other European mountainous areas and were in many cases above the
   threshold recommended for ecosystem protection by regional and European
   environmental authorities. The highest concentrations were found at

Abstract = {{Systematic species surveys over large areas are mostly not affordable,
   constraining conservation planners to make best use of incomplete data.
   Spatially explicit species distribution models (SDM) may be useful to
   detect and compensate for incomplete information. SDMs can either be
   based on standardized, systematic sampling in a restricted subarea, or -
   as a cost-effective alternative - on data haphazardly collated by
   ``volunteer-based monitoring schemes'' (VMS), area-wide but inherently
   biased and of heterogeneous spatial precision. Using data on
   capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, we evaluated the capacity of SDMs
   generated from incomplete survey data to localise unknown areas
   inhabited by the species and to predict relative local observation
   density. Addressing the trade-off between data precision, sample size
   and spatial extent of the sampling area, we compared three different
   sampling strategies: VMS-data collected throughout the whole study area
   (7000 km(2)) using either 1) exact locations or 2) locations aggregated
   to grid cells of the size of an average individual home range, and 3)
   systematic transect counts conducted within a small subarea (23.8
   km(2)). For each strategy, we compared two sample sizes and two
   modelling methods (ENFA and Maxent), which were evaluated using
   cross-validation and independent data. Models based on VMS-data
   (strategies 1 and 2) performed equally well in predicting relative
   observation density and in localizing ``unknown'' occurrences. They
   always outperformed strategy 3-models, irrespective of sample size and
   modelling method, partly because the VMS-data provided the more
   comprehensive clues for setting the discrimination-threshold for
   predicting presence or absence. Accounting for potential errors due to
   extrapolation (e.g. projections outside the environmental domain or
   potentially biasing variables) reduced, but did not fully compensate for
   the observed discrepancies. As they cover a broader range of
   species-habitat relations, the area-wide data achieved a better model
   quality with less a-priori knowledge. Furthermore, in a highly mobile
   species like capercaillie a sampling resolution corresponding to an
   individuals' home range can lead to equally good predictions as the use
   of exact locations. Consequently, when a trade-off between the sampling
   effort and the spatial extent of the sampling area is necessary, less
   precise data unsystematically collected over a large representative
   region are preferable to systematically sampled data from a restricted
   region.}},

   possible hazard for sediment-dwelling organisms}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The Lagoon of Venice is a well-known Italian environment
   characterized by heavy chemical pollution. Few studies have been carried
   out to evaluate the probable hazards of the chemical mixtures toward the
   biocoenosis. This is the first comprehensive study aimed at the
   evaluation of the possible adverse effects for benthic organisms from
   the Lagoon of Venice due to some persistent organic pollutants by using
   three different sediment quality guidelines (SQGs).
   Materials and methods We measured the concentrations of some priority
   industrial (PAHs and PCBs) and agricultural (DDTs, HCHs, and HCB)
   pollutants in surface sediments of eight sampling stations, chosen on
   the basis of their environmental features and probable pollution
   sources. Since the use of only the POP concentrations does not allow for
   an overall and correct environmental risk assessment, we followed an
   approach based on three different SQGs to identify a possible hazard for
   benthic invertebrates: the TEL/PEL approach, the consensus SQGs obtained
   by threshold effect concentration (TEC), probable effect concentration
   (PEC), and extreme effect concentration (EEC) proposed for several OCs
   and PAHs, and the ERL-ERM guidelines, which consider the role of a
   chemical mixture by using the m-ERM-Q (mean ERM quotient).
   Results and discussion Nonetheless the great amount of anthropogenic
   chemical sources as industries and intense road and ship traffic, PAHs
   (15.08-388.89 ng g(-1) d.w.) and PCBs (0.62-8.69 ng g(-1) d.w.) were
   detected in low to moderate concentrations. High levels were found for
   the organochlorine compounds (OCs), especially the DDT homologues
   (7.28-213.15 ng g(-1) d.w.), which were likely transported through some
   tributaries of the inland into the Lagoon. To evaluate the possible
   hazard for the biocoenosis, we evaluated the toxic effects that might be
   expected to the benthic organisms by using three different SQGs. They
   showed that the pollution of six stations can cause moderate to high
   adverse effects to sediment-dwelling organisms, mainly due to OCs, while
   the contribution of PAHs to the total toxicity seems to be negligible.
   Conclusions This study has demonstrated the presence of a widespread
   contamination caused by POPs in the Lagoon of Venice that is not always
   related to the localization of the expected emission sources. By using
   different SQGs, we highlighted a non-negligible environmental hazard for
   benthic invertebrates living in this environment, since the majority of
   the sampling sites studied present a possible moderate to high toxicity
   for the sediment-dwelling organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Species distribution models (SDMs) can provide useful information for
   managing biological invasions, such as identification of priority areas
   for early detection or for determining containment boundaries. However,
   prediction of invasive species using SDMs can be challenging because
   they typically violate the core assumption of being at equilibrium with
   their environment, which may lead to poorly guided management resulting
   from high levels of omission. Our goal was to provide a suite of
   potential decision strategies (DSs) that were not reliant on the
   equilibrium assumption but rather could be chosen to better match the
   management application, which in this case was to ensure containment
   through adequate surveillance. We used presence-only data and expert
   knowledge for model calibration and presence/absence data to evaluate
   the potential distribution of an introduced mesquite (Leguminoseae:
   Prosopis) invasion located in the Pilbara Region of northwest Western
   Australia. Five different DSs with varying levels of conservatism/risk
   were derived from a multi-criteria evaluation model using ordered
   weighted averaging. The performance of DSs over all possible thresholds
   was examined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. DSs
   not on the convex hull of the ROC curves were discarded. Two threshold
   determination methods (TDMs) were compared on the two remaining DSs, one
   that assumed equilibrium (by maximizing overall prediction success) and
   another that assumed the invasion was ongoing (using a 95\% threshold
   for true positives). The most conservative DS fitted the validation data
   most closely but could only predict 75\% of the presence data. A more
   risk-taking DS could predict 95\% of the presence data, which identified
   8.5 times more area for surveillance, and better highlighted known
   populations that are still rapidly invading. This DS and TOM coupling
   was considered to be the most appropriate for our management
   application. Our results show that predictive niche modeling was highly
   sensitive to risk levels, but that these can be tailored to match
   specified management objectives. The methods implemented can be readily
   adapted to other invasive species or for conservation purposes. Crown

Abstract = {{Cultural eutrophication of surface waters has become a major source of
   water-quality impairment throughout the US. In response, the US
   Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has devised a national strategy
   for the development of regional nutrient criteria. Our study is part of
   New York State's effort to revise its narrative nutrient standard for N
   and P and is based on the USEPA's recommended weight-of-evidence
   approach. The objective of our investigation was to identify nutrient
   thresholds based on a final weighted average of results from percentile
   analysis, nonparametric deviance reduction (changepoint), and cluster
   analysis. The thresholds were determined from shifts in biological
   community structure (benthic macroinvertebrate and diatom) related to
   water-column nutrient data from 40 large river sites throughout New York
   State. USEPA's percentile analysis yielded possible criteria of 0.023 mg
   total P (TP)/L, 0.51 mg total N (TN)/L, 0.16 mg NO(3)-N /L, and 2.4 mg
   chlorophyll a (chl a)/m(3). Threshold responses in benthic
   macroinvertebrate metrics at the 50(th) percentile occurred at
   concentrations between 0.009 and 0.07 mg TP/L, 0.41 and 1.2 mg TN/L,
   0.18 and 0.55 mg NO(3)-N/L, and 2.1 mg chl a/m(3). Cluster analysis
   yielded 3 groups of sites based on macroinvertebrate and diatom taxa.
   The median nutrient values of the medium-nutrient-condition site
   clusters were used to set criteria for TP and TN. For site clusters
   based on macroinvertebrate data these values were 0.037 mg TP/L and 0.68
   mg TN/L. For clusters based on diatom data these were 0.037 mg TP/L and
   0.78 mg TN/L. Based on the weight-of-evidence approach and results from
   all 3 methods, the proposed guidance values for nutrients in large
   rivers are 0.03 mg TP/L, 0.7 mg TN/L, 0.3 mg NO(3)-N/L, and 2.2 mg chl a
   /m(3). These values are similar to those derived by others and provide
   meaningful nutrient endpoints that would be protective of aquatic life
   in large rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear ecological responses to anthropogenic forcing are common, and
   in some cases, the ecosystem responds by assuming a new stable state.
   This article is an overview and serves as the introduction to several
   articles in this BRIDGES cluster that are directed toward managers
   interested in dealing with nonlinear responses in freshwaters,
   particularly streams. A threshold or breakpoint occurs where the system
   responds rapidly to a relatively small change in a driver. The existence
   of a threshold can signal a change in system configuration to an
   alternative stable state, although such a change does not occur with all
   thresholds. In general, a mechanistic understanding of ecological
   dynamics is required to predict thresholds, where they will occur, and
   if they are associated with the occurrence of alternative stable states.
   Thresholds are difficult to predict, although a variety of univariate
   methods has been used to indicate thresholds in ecological data. When we
   applied several methods to one type of response variable, the resulting
   threshold values varied 3-fold, indicating that more research on
   detection methods is necessary. Numerous case studies suggest that the
   threshold concept is important in all ecosystems. Managers should be
   aware that human actions might result in undesirable rapid changes and
   potentially an unwanted alternative stable state, and that recovery from
   that state might require far more resources and time than avoiding
   entering the state in the first place would have required. Given the
   difficulties in predicting thresholds and alternative states, the
   precautionary approach to ecosystem management is probably the most
   prudent.}},

Abstract = {{Impacts of global climate change, such as sea level rise and severe
   drought, have altered the hydrology of coastal salt marshes resulting in
   submergence and subsequent degradation of ecosystem function. A
   potential method of rehabilitating these systems is the addition of
   sediment-slurries to increase marsh surface elevation, thus ameliorating
   effects of excessive inundation. Although this technique is growing in
   popularity, the restoration of ecological function after sediment
   addition has received little attention. To determine if sediment
   subsidized salt marshes are functionally equivalent to natural marshes,
   we examined above- and belowground primary production in replicated
   restored marshes receiving four levels of sediment addition (29-42 cm
   North American Vertical Datum of 1988 {[}NAVD 88]) and in degraded and
   natural ambient marshes (4-22 cm NAVD 88). Moderate intensities of
   sediment-slurry addition, resulting in elevations at the mid to high
   intertidal zone (29-36 cm NAVD 88), restored ecological function to
   degraded salt marshes. Sediment additions significantly decreased flood
   duration and frequency and increased bulk density, resulting in greater
   soil drainage and redox potential and significantly lower phytotoxic
   sulfide concentrations. However, ecological function in the restored
   salt marsh showed a sediment addition threshold that was characterized
   by a decline in primary productivity in areas of excessive sediment
   addition and high elevation (> 36 cm NAVD 88). Hence, the addition of
   intermediate levels of sediment to submerging salt marshes increased
   marsh surface elevation, ameliorated impacts of prolonged inundation,
   and increased primary productivity. However, too much sediment resulted
   in diminished ecological function that was equivalent to the submerged
   or degraded system.}},

Abstract = {{Screening is widely used to prioritize chemicals according to their
   potential environmental hazard, as expressed in the attributes of
   persistence, bioaccumulation (B), toxicity and long range transport
   potential (LRTP). Many screening approaches for B and LRTP rely on the
   categorization of chemicals based on a comparison of their equilibrium
   partition coefficients between octanol and water (K-OW), air and water
   (K-AW) and octanol and air (K-OA) with a threshold value. As
   experimental values of the properties are mostly unavailable for the
   large number of chemicals being screened, the use of quantitative
   structure-property relationships (QSPRs) and other computational
   chemistry methods becomes indispensable. Predictions by different
   methods often deviate considerably, and flawed predictions may lead to
   false positive/negative categorizations. We predicted the partitioning
   properties of 529 chemicals, culled from previous prioritization
   efforts, using the four prediction methods EPI Suite, SPARC, COSMOtherm,
   and ABSOLV. The four sets of predictions were used to screen the
   chemicals against various LRTP and B criteria. Screening results based
   on the four methods were consistent for only similar to 70\% of the
   chemicals. To further assess whether the means of estimating
   environmental phase partitioning has an impact, a subset of 110
   chemicals was screened for elevated arctic contamination potential based
   on single-parameter and poly-parameter linear free energy relationships
   respectively. Different categorizations were observed for 5 out of 110
   chemicals. Screening and categorization methods that rely on a decision
   whether a chemical's predicted property falls on either side of a
   threshold are likely to lead to a significant number of false
   positive/negative outcomes. We therefore suggest that screening should
   rather be based on numerical hazard or risk estimates that acknowledge
   and explicitly take into account the uncertainties of predicted
   properties. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Organotin compounds (OTCs) are a large class of synthetic
   chemicals with widely varying properties. Due to their potential adverse
   health effects, their use has been restricted in many countries. Humans
   are exposed to OTCs mostly through fish consumption.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe OTC exposure through
   fish consumption and to assess the associated potential health risks in
   a Finnish population.
   Methods: An extensive sampling of Finnish domestic fish was carried out
   in the Baltic Sea and freshwater areas in 2005-2007. In addition,
   samples of imported seafood were collected in 2008. The chemical
   analysis was performed in an accredited testing laboratory during
   2005-2008. Average daily intake of the sum of dibutyltin (DBT),
   tributyltin (TBT), triphenyltin (TPhT) and dioctyltin (DOT) (Sigma OTCs)
   for the Finnish population was calculated on the basis of the measured
   concentrations and fish consumption rates.
   Results: The average daily intake of Sigma OTCs through fish consumption
   was 3.2 ng/kg bw day(-1), which is 1.3\% from the Tolerable Daily Intake
   (TDI) of 250 ng/kg bw day(-1) set by the European Food Safety Authority.
   In total, domestic wild fish accounted for 61\% of the Sigma OTC intake,
   while the intake through domestic farmed fish was 4.0\% and the intake
   through imported fish was 35\%. The most important species were domestic
   perch and imported salmon and rainbow trout.
   Conclusions: The Finnish consumers are not likely to exceed the
   threshold level for adverse health effects due to OTC intake through
   fish consumption. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The pollutant tropospheric ozone causes human health problems, and
   environmental degradation and acts as a potent greenhouse gas. Using
   long-term hourly observations at five US air quality monitoring surface
   stations we studied the seasonal and diel cycles of ozone concentrations
   and surface air temperature to examine the temporal evolution over the
   past two decades. Such an approach allows visualizing the impact of
   natural and anthropogenic processes on ozone: nocturnal inversion
   development, photochemistry, and stratospheric intrusion. Analysis of
   the result provides an option for determining the duration for a
   regulatory ozone season. The application of the method provides
   independent confirmation of observed changes and trends in the ozone and
   temperature data records as reported elsewhere. The results provide
   further evidence supporting the assertion that ozone reductions can be
   attributed to emission reductions as opposed to weather variation.
   Despite a (similar to 0.5 degrees C decade(-1)) daytime warming trend,
   ozone decreased by up to 6 ppb decade(-1) during times of maximum
   temperature in the most polluted locations. Ozone also decreased across
   the emission reduction threshold of 2002 by 6-10 ppb indicating that
   emission reductions have been effective where and when it is most
   needed. Longer time series, and coupling with other data sources, may
   allow for the direct investigation of climate change influence on
   regional ozone air pollution formation and destruction over annual and

Abstract = {{P>1. When entering freshwater, young European eels either become
   resident or disperse to settle upstream. While this process shapes the
   whole population structure, little is known about how the `decision' is
   made. Here, we investigated the possible role of body size.
   2. A 1-year capture-recapture programme was carried out on 1505 European
   eels (length-range 62-633 mm) at two freshwater sites on the Saucats
   River, France. Eels were separated into two groups based on body length
   and this determined the tagging method; 1350 smaller eels (< 240 mm)
   were tagged with visible implant elastomer tags, and 155 larger eels (>
   239 mm) were tagged individually with a passive integrated transponder.
   3. Migration was detected only in eels < 240 mm and decreased with
   increasing body length within this group. The probability of migration
   was higher in the summer, suggesting an environmental window for upriver
   dispersal. During this period, the mean probability of migration was
   estimated at 0.79 for 62-mm-long eels, 0.5 for 121 mm-long eels and 0.05
   for 223 mm-long eels.
   4. This is the first study to demonstrate, using capture-recapture
   models, the existence of differing eel behavioural tactics (residence
   and migration) based on body size. Such models are useful tools for
   analysing site fidelity and dispersal. If we assume that a migration
   probability > 0.05 means that such eels contribute substantially to
   upriver colonisation, this corresponds to eels < 220 mm in the Saucats
   River, although the threshold body size may be highly dependent on the
   river system.}},

   concentrations (TEC and PEC) derived from consensus-based sediment
   quality guidelines for individual PAH analytes and equilibrium
   partitioning sediment benchmarks-toxic units (Sigma ESB-TU) derived for
   PAH mixtures. For human health benchmarks, we used preliminary
   remediation goals (PRGs). Sediments of five stormwater ponds (four
   commercial ponds and one residential pond with a large drainage area)
   exceeded PEC values for several PAH analytes and the Sigma ESB-TU safe
   value of 1 for PAH mixtures. These same five stormwater ponds also
   exceeded the PRG values for five carcinogenic PAH analytes. These

   increased risk of cancer to humans ex situ following excavation and
   on-site disposal. We recommend that sediment from these stormwater ponds

Abstract = {{Clustering methods are widely used tools in many aspects of science,
   such as ecology, medicine, or even market research, that commonly deal
   with dendrogram-based analyses. In such analyses, for a given initial
   dissimilarity matrix, the resulting dendrogram may strongly vary
   according to the selected clustering methods. However, numerous
   dendrogram-based analyses require adequate measurement for assessing of
   which of the clustering methods preserves most faithfully the initial
   dissimilarity matrix. While cophenetic correlation coefficient-based
   measures have been widely used for this purpose, we emphasize here that
   it is not always a suitable approach. We thus propose a measure based on
   a matrix norm, the 2-norm, to adequately check which of the resulting
   ultrametric distance matrices related to the dendrograms is the closest
   to the initial dissimilarity matrix. In addition, we also propose an
   objective way to define a benchmark value (threshold value) in order to
   assess whether the degree of conformity between the ultrametric distance
   matrix selected and the initial dissimilarity matrix is satisfactory.
   Our proposal may notably be incorporated within a recently proposed
   approach that involves the use of clustering methods in environmental
   science and beyond. In ecology, various functional diversity indices
   based on clustering species from their functional dissimilarities may
   benefit from this overall approach.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainties in energy demand modelling originate from both limited

   energy use on the basis of activity levels, structural change and

   44-95\% around the best-fit projection. Two different model
   interpretations of the past can generally be distinguished: (1) high

   low useful energy intensity and little efficiency improvement.

Abstract = {{Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urban environments are often
   derived from point and nonpoint sources, the latter collectively
   considered as urban background. Quantifying the contributions of point
   sources and urban background is important for managing and remediating
   urban sediments. In this work, the sources of PAHs in 350 sediments from
   a 1.5-mile portion of the Little Menomonee River (Milwaukee, WI) were
   determined using principal component analysis (PCA), chemical
   fingerprinting, and positive matrix factorization (PMF), the combination
   of which mitigates weaknesses of any one method. At issue was
   quantifying the contributions of a creosote point-source formerly
   located 3.5 to 5.0 miles upstream versus urban background-derived PAHs
   in the sediments. In total, creosote and urban background contributed 27
   and 73\% (+/- 14\%) of eight carcinogenic PAHs (CPAHs), respectively, in
   this part of the River. The concentrations of CPAHs derived from urban
   background were highest in surface sediments (0-6 in.; 20 +/- 17 mg/kg),
   particularly near major roadway crossings, increased in the downstream
   direction, and (on average) exceeded the 15 mg/kg regulatory cleanup
   threshold. Weathered creosote-derived CPAHs were widespread at low
   concentrations (4.8 +/- 8.1 mg/kg) although some discrete sediments,
   mostly at depths below 6 in., contained elevated CPAHs derived from
   creosote. This work demonstrates the value of combining multiple
   techniques in source apportionment studies in urban sediments. It
   further demonstrates a means to determine the concentration of PAHs
   attributable to nonpoint sourced background in urban sediments without
   the need to identify, collect, and analyze (assumedly)
   ``representative{''} background samples, which may not even exist in
   heterogeneous urban watersheds.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{287-299}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Question
   Community ecologists are often confronted with multiple possible
   partitions of a single set of records of species composition and/or
   abundances from several sites. Different methods of numerical
   classification produce different results, and the question is which of
   them, and how many clusters, should be selected for interpretation. We
   demonstrate a new method for identifying the optimal partition from a
   series of partitions of the same set of sites, based on number of
   species with high fidelity to clusters in a partition (faithful
   species).
   Methods
   The new method, OptimClass, has two variants. OptimClass 1 searches the
   partition with the maximum number of faithful species across all
   clusters, while OptimClass 2 searches the partition with the maximum
   number of clusters that contain at least a preselected minimum number of
   faithful species. Faithful species are determined based on the P value
   of the Fisher's exact test, as a measure of fidelity. OptimClass was
   tested on three vegetation datasets that varied in species richness and
   internal heterogeneity, using several classification algorithms,
   resemblance measures and cover transformations.
   Results
   Results from both variants of OptimClass depended on the preselected
   threshold P value for faithful species: higher P gave higher probability
   that a partition with more clusters was selected as optimal. Good
   partitions, in terms of OptimClass criteria, involved flexible beta
   clustering, and also ordinal clustering. Good partitions were also
   obtained with TWINSPAN when the required number of clusters was small,
   or UPGMA when the required number of clusters was large. Poor partitions
   usually resulted from classifications that used resemblance measures and
   cover transformations emphasizing differences in species cover; this is
   not unexpected because OptimClass uses a presence/absence-based fidelity
   measure.
   Conclusions
   If the aim of a classification is to obtain clusters rich in faithful
   species, which can be subsequently used as diagnostic species for
   identification of community types, OptimClass is a suitable method for
   simultaneous choice of the optimal classification algorithm and optimal
   number of clusters. It can be computed in the JUICE program.}},

   low-contrast patterns must be detected even at luminance levels that
   differ from the eye adaptation level. All deviations from ideal
   luminance conditions cause the observer to detect patterns with reduced
   eye sensitivity but the magnitude of this reduction is unclear. A method
   is presented to display well-defined sinusoidal low-contrast test
   patterns on an liquid crystal display. The observers were exposed to
   light from three different areas: (i) the test pattern covering
   approximately 28 3 28; (ii) the remaining of the display surface and
   (iii) ambient light from outside the display area covering most of the

Abstract = {{The spectral characteristics of mangroves on the Beihai Coast of

   Landsat TM5 image obtained on January 8, 2003. It is detailed enough to
   facilitate the introduction of the algorithm principle and trains
   project of the neural network. Neural network algorithms have
   characteristics including large-scale data handling and distributing
   information storage. This research firstly analyzes the necessity and
   complexity of this translation system, and then introduces the strong
   points of the neural network. Processing mangrove landscape
   characteristics by using neural network is an important innovation, with
   great theoretical and practical significance. This kind of neural
   network can greatly improve the classification accuracy. The spatial
   resolution of Landsat TM5 is high enough to facilitate the research, and
   the false color composite from 3-, 4-, and 5-bands has a clear boundary
   and provides a significant quantity of information and effective images.
   On the basis of a field survey, the exported layers are defined as
   mangrove, vegetation, bare land, wetlands and shrimp pool. TM satellite
   images are applied to false color composites by using 3-, 4-, and
   5-bands, and then a supervised classification model is used to classify
   the image. The processing method of hyper-spectrum remote sensing allows
   the spectral characteristics of the mangrove to be determined, and
   integrates the result with the NN classification for the false color
   composite by using 3-, 4-, and 5-bands. The network model consists of
   three layers, i.e., the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output
   layer. The input layer number of classification is defined as 3, and the
   hidden layers are defined as 5 according to the function operation. The
   control threshold is 0.9. The training ratio is 0.2. The maximum permit
   error is 0.08. The classification precision reaches 86.86\%. This is
   higher than the precision of maximal parallel classification (50.79\%)
   and the spectrum angle classification (75.39\%). The results include the

Abstract = {{Characterizing the relative severity of human disturbance in watersheds
   is often part of stream assessments and is frequently done with the aid
   of Geographic Information System (GIS)-derived data. However, the choice
   of variables and how they are used to quantify disturbance are often
   subjective. In this study, we developed a number of disturbance indices
   by testing sets of variables, scoring methods, and weightings of 33
   potential disturbance factors derived from readily available GIS data.
   The indices were calibrated using 770 watersheds located in the western
   United States for which the severity of disturbance had previously been
   classified from detailed local data by the United States Environmental
   Protection Agency (USEPA) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
   Program (EMAP). The indices were calibrated by determining which
   variable or variable combinations and aggregation method best
   differentiated between least- and most-disturbed sites. Indices composed
   of several variables performed better than any individual variable, and
   best results came from a threshold method of scoring using six
   uncorrelated variables: housing unit density, road density, pesticide
   application, dam storage, land cover along a mainstem buffer, and
   distance to nearest canal/pipeline. The final index was validated with
   192 withheld watersheds and correctly classified about two-thirds (68\%)
   of least- and most-disturbed sites. These results provide information
   about the potential for using a disturbance index as a screening tool
   for a priori ranking of watersheds at a regional/national scale, and
   which landscape variables and methods of combination may be most helpful
   in doing so. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Quantile regression and an extension of a Oaxaca/Blinder decomposition

   Observations were collected in xeric and mountainous ecoregions with
   distinct natural environments, of diverse and confounding land uses, and
   exhibiting different ranges of benthic fitness. The behavior of the
   benthic community fitness at the extremes is of particular interest to
   resource managers for prioritizing stressors. Quantile regression
   characterizes behavior of specific response percentiles (the response
   for which the specified percent of population responses are at or below
   that value), depending on related conditions (covariates). In this
   application it is used to asses the change in association of fitness
   score and stream condition as the level of disturbance in stream
   segments changes. Quantile regression models the response behavior
   conditional on the covariates taken together. The Oaxaca/Blinder method
   estimates the unconditional effect of a particular covariate after
   accounting for explainable differences due to the rest of the
   covariates. Modeling the unconditional behavior provides a region-wide
   description of fitness-stressor associations. In this application,
   Melly's (2006) extension of the Oaxaca/Blinder decomposition is employed
   to estimate differences between quantiles of stream segments with a
   stressor condition above or below a dividing threshold after accounting

   Risk}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{387-393}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The National Research Council (NRC) Committee on Improving
   Risk Analysis Approaches Used by the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection
   Agency) recommended that low-dose risks be estimated in some situations
   using human variability distributions (HVDs). HVD modeling estimates
   log-normal distributions from data on pharmacokinetic and
   pharmacodynamic variables that affect individual sensitivities to the
   toxic response. These distributions are combined into an overall
   log-normal distribution for the threshold dose (dose below which there
   is no contribution to a toxic response) by assuming the variables act
   independently and multiplicatively. This distribution is centered at a
   point-of-departure dose that is usually estimated from animal data. The
   resulting log-normal distribution is used to quantify low-dose risk.
   OBJECTIVE: We examined the implications of various assumptions in HVD
   modeling for estimating low-dose risk.
   METHODS: The assumptions and data used in HVD modeling were subjected to
   rigorous scrutiny.
   RESULTS: We found that the assumption that the variables affecting human
   sensitivity vary log normally is not scientifically defensible. Other
   distributions that are equally consistent with the data provide very
   different estimates of low-dose risk. HVD modeling can also involve an
   assumption that a threshold dose defined by dichotomizing a continuous
   apical response has a log-normal distribution. This assumption is shown
   to be incompatible (except under highly specialized conditions) with
   assuming that the continuous apical response itself is log normal.
   However, the two assumptions can lead to very different estimates of
   low-dose risk. The assumption in HVD modeling that the threshold dose
   can be expressed as a function of a product of independent variables
   lacks phenomenological support. We provide an example that shows that
   this assumption is generally invalid.
   CONCLUSION: In view of these problems, we recommend caution in the use
   of HVD modeling as a general approach to estimating low-dose risks from
   human exposures to toxic chemicals.}},

   community thresholds}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-37}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Existing methods for identifying ecological community thresholds are
   designed for univariate indicators or multivariate dimension-reduction
   of community structure. Most are insensitive to responses of individual
   taxa with low occurrence frequencies or highly variable abundances,
   properties of the vast majority of taxa in community data sets. We
   introduce Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) to detect changes in
   taxa distributions along an environmental gradient over space or time,
   and assess synchrony among taxa change points as evidence for community
   thresholds.
   2. TITAN uses indicator species scores to integrate occurrence,
   abundance and directionality of taxa responses. It identifies the
   optimum value of a continuous variable, x, that partitions sample units
   while maximizing taxon-specific scores. Indicator z scores standardize
   original scores relative to the mean and SD of permuted samples along x,
   thereby emphasizing the relative magnitude of change and increasing the
   contributions of taxa with low occurrence frequencies but high
   sensitivity to the gradient. TITAN distinguishes negative (z-) and
   positive (z+) taxa responses and tracks cumulative responses of
   declining {[}sum(z-)] and increasing {[}sum(z+)] taxa in the community.
   Bootstrapping is used to estimate indicator reliability and purity as
   well as uncertainty around the location of individual taxa and community
   change points.
   3. Using two simulated data sets, TITAN correctly identified taxon and
   community thresholds in more than 99\% of 500 unique versions of each
   simulation. In contrast, multivariate change-point analysis did not
   distinguish directional taxa responses, resulting in much wider
   confidence intervals that in one instance failed to capture thresholds
   in 38\% of the iterations.
   4. Retrospective analysis of macroinvertebrate community response to a
   phosphorus gradient supported previous threshold estimates, although
   TITAN produced narrower confidence limits and revealed that several taxa
   declined at lower levels of phosphorus. Re-analysis of macroinvertebrate
   responses to an urbanization gradient illustrated disparate change
   points for declining (0.81-3.3\% urban land) and increasing (6.8-26.6\%)
   taxa, whereas the published threshold estimate (20-30\%) missed the
   declining-taxa threshold because it could not distinguish their
   synchronous decline from the gradual increase in ubiquitous taxa.
   5. Synthesis and applications. By deconstructing communities to assess
   synchrony of taxon-specific change points, TITAN provides a sensitive
   and precise alternative to existing methods for assessing community
   thresholds. TITAN has tremendous potential to inform conservation of
   rare or threatened species, develop species sensitivity models, identify
   reference conditions and to support development of numerical regulatory
   criteria.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution information of clay layer Occurrence depth
   (CLOD), particularly the spatial distribution maps of occurrence of clay

   uncertainty and consequently increase prediction accuracy in simulated
   results by using nonlinear estimators and incorporating various
   interclass relationships. In this paper, a MCG method was suggested to
   simulate the CLOD in a meso-scale alluvial soil area by encoding the
   continuous variable with several threshold values into binary variables
   (for single thresholds) or a multi-class variable (for all thresholds
   being considered together). Related optimal prediction maps, realization

Abstract = {{A coupled Bayesian model selection and geostatistical regression

   productivity (GPP) at six AmeriFlux sites, including the Kennedy Space
   Center Scrub Oak, Vaira Ranch, Tonzi Ranch, Blodgett Forest, Morgan
   Monroe State Forest, and Harvard Forest sites. The analysis is performed
   at a continuum of temporal scales ranging from daily to monthly, for a
   period of seven years. A total of 10 covariates representing
   environmental stimuli and indices of plant physiology are considered in
   explaining variations in GPP. Similarly to other statistical methods,
   the presented approach estimates regression coefficients and
   uncertainties associated with the covariates in a selected regression
   model. Unlike traditional regression methods, however, the approach also
   estimates the uncertainty associated with the selection of a single
   ``best{''} model of GPP. In addition, the approach provides an enhanced
   understanding of how the importance of specific covariates changes with
   the examined timescale (i.e. temporal resolution). An examination of
   changes in the importance of specific covariates across timescales
   reveals thresholds above or below which covariates become important in
   explaining GPP. Results indicate that most sites (especially those with
   a stronger seasonal cycle) exhibit at least one prominent scaling
   threshold between the daily and 20-day temporal scales. This
   demonstrates that environmental variables that explain GPP at synoptic
   scales are different from those that capture its seasonality. At shorter
   time scales, radiation, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit exert
   the most significant influence on GPP at most examined sites. At coarser
   time scales, however, the importance of these covariates in explaining
   GPP declines. Overall, unique best models are identified at most sites
   at the daily scale, whereas multiple competing models are identified at
   longer time scales.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the economic value of nature and the services it provides
   to humanity has become increasingly important for local, national, and
   global policy and decision making. It has become obvious that
   quantifying and integrating these services into decision making will be
   crucial for sustainable development. Problems arise in that it is
   difficult to obtain meaningful values for the goods and services that
   ecosystems provide and for which there is no formal market. A wide range
   of ecosystem services fall into this category. Additional problems arise
   when economic methods are applied inappropriately and when the
   importance of ecosystem maintenance for human welfare is underestimated.
   In this article we identify a place for monetary valuation within the
   pluralistic approach supported by ecological economics and assess
   progress to date in the application of environmental valuation to
   ecosystem service provision. We first review definitions of ecosystem
   services in order to make an operational link to valuation methods. We
   then discuss the spatially explicit nature of ecosystem services
   provision and benefits capture. We highlight the importance of valuing
   marginal changes and the role for macroscale valuation, nonlinearities
   in service benefits, and the significance of nonconvexities (threshold
   effects). We also review guidance on valuation studies quality
   assurance, and discuss the problems inherent in the methodology as
   exposed by the findings of behavioral economics, as well as with
   benefits transfer-the most common way valuation studies are applied in
   the policy process. We argue for a sequential decision support system
   that can lead to a more integrated and rigorous approach to
   environmental valuation and biophysical measurement of ecosystem
   services. This system itself then needs to be encompassed within a more
   comprehensive multicriteria assessment dialogue and process.}},

Booktitle = {{GLOBAL ENVIONMENTAL POLICIES: IMPACT, MANAGEMENT AND EFFECTS}},
Series = {{Environmental Science Engineering and Technology}},
Year = {{2010}},
Pages = {{185-225}},
Abstract = {{In this time, the Impact Assessment is the best process to structure and
   support the development of global/local environmental policies. It
   identifies territorial/spatial problems and objectives (by several ex
   ante and ex post steps) and the main political/programming scenarios and
   project options measuring impacts on economic, environmental, cultural
   and social fields. It outlines advantages and disadvantages for each
   option and it examines all possible synergies and trade-offs on the base
   of territorial context.
   In order to obtain the integration of different tools (Territorial
   Impact Assessment - TIA, Strategic Environmental Assessment - SEA,
   Environmental Impact Assessment - EIA), it wars necessary to work within
   a systemic vision (from Von Bertanlaffy General Theory, 1969; to Saaty
   analytical hierarchy process, 1980; to analytical planning, 1985),
   pursuing its application into economicterritorial analysis and planning
   choices (Prezioso, 1995, 2003 and 2007).
   To use Impact Assessment means to be able: i) to know effects of
   policies, programmes, planning on territorial status quo indicators
   before; ii) to measure the degree of risk of overtaking the carrying
   capacity threshold and the improvement in performance and
   competitiveness; iii) to build scenarios of funds allocations and
   management, according to indications provided by the Territorial
   Capability Framework.
   This way was already anticipated in 2005 by the European Commission,
   pursuing the way of ``Better Regulation{''}, who started several formal
   and informal initiatives. Among them, the Impact Assessment proposal was
   a new method to introduce a common support within the framework of the
   Better Regulation package and the European Sustainable Development
   Strategy.
   This proposal aroused great interest, since it could orientate further
   policy goals and choices differently. In fact, the Impact Assessment
   introduced a new method in 2002, integrating and replacing previous
   single-sector types of assessment.
   Impact Assessment (IA) is a process aimed at structuring and supporting
   the policies' development.
   It identifies and assesses the problem at stake and all objectives
   pursued. It identifies the main options to achieve objectives and it
   analyses their impacts in economic, environmental and social fields. It
   outlines advantages and disadvantages of each option and it examines
   possible synergies and trade-offs.
   The Impact Assessment is an aid to political decision, not a substitute
   to it. It informs decisionmakers about impacts of each proposal, but it
   leaves them free to take their decisions.
   This approach will be particularly important if it really aims to carry
   on a sustainable economic territorial growth. Of course, it requires
   institutions and policy makers to accept sustainability as a political
   permanently stance, as a principle for the period 2007-2013 and as an
   orientation for local/global (regional/national) European
   competitiveness.
   The sustainable development became part of the territorial and economic
   planning, it induced a gradual evolution within the selection of
   measures different from the monetary one and it suggested and supported
   methods, process, specific indicators for the phenomena evaluation and
   management, using units of measure different from the price, the
   principle indicator of the market esteem.}},

Abstract = {{Thousands of high production volume (HPV) chemicals are used in the US
   at rates exceeding 450 000 kg (1 million pounds) per year, yet little is
   known about their fates during wastewater treatment and upon release
   into the environment. We utilized a recently introduced empirical model
   to predict the fraction of the mass loading (in raw sewage) that is
   expected to persist in digested sludge following conventional municipal
   treatment of chemical-laden sewage. The model requires only two readily
   available input parameters, a compound's log K(OW) value and a
   dimensionless curve fitting parameter (p(fit)). Following refinement of
   the fitting parameter and cross-validation of the model using the
   Jackknife method, we predicted the mass fractions of 207 hydrophobic HPV
   chemicals (log KOW of >= 4.0) that are expected to accumulate in
   digested municipal sludge during conventional wastewater treatment.
   Using this screening approach in conjunction with information from
   toxicity databases, we identified 11 HPV chemicals that are of potential
   concern due to (i) their propensity to accumulate and persist in sludge
   (>50\% of mass loading), (ii) unfavorable ecotoxicity threshold values,
   and (iii) structural characteristics suggestive of environmental
   persistence following release of these HPV chemicals on land during
   biosolids recycling. The in silico screening approach taken in this
   study highlights existing environmental monitoring needs and may guide

Abstract = {{A common biological effect of exposure to workplace chemicals is sensory
   irritation. The ACGIH (R) threshold limit values (TLVs (R)) are
   developed based on data derived from industrial settings as well as
   experimental human and animal studies. Considering the limited amount of
   human data and the tendency to reduce the volume of animal testing,
   there is a need for an alternative method to assess sensory irritation.
   Nasal pungency involves transfer of a compound through the mucosa into
   the receptor area. This environment is inhomogeneous, being partly a
   hydrophobic lipid-like and hydrophilic aqueous-like area. A general
   equation has been developed that seems satisfactory for explaining the
   transfer of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the gaseous phase to
   biophases, making it possible to calculate the nasal pungency threshold
   (NPT). The obtained correlation between log 1/NPT and log TLV for 71
   VOCs, which is based exclusively on their irritant properties, indicates
   that for the compounds that act through a nonreactive mechanism
   (alcohols, ketones, esters, ethers, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons,
   amides) the relationship between these values differs from that
   calculated for compounds that act through a reactive mechanism
   (aldehydes, allyl compounds, aliphatic amines, benzyl halides,
   carboxylic acids, acrylates, and mercaptans). The correlation
   coefficient for nonreactive VOCs is very high (n = 46, r = 0.89), and it
   appears that the regression equation (log TLV = -0.422 log 1/NPT +
   0.309) could be used to predict occupational exposure limits (OELs) for
   this group of compounds. Regarding reactive VOCs, the correlation
   coefficient is considerably lower (n = 25, r = 0.32), which implies that
   some kind of correction for their reactivity would have to be applied to
   calculate the OEL values.}},

Volume = {{412}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Abstract = {{Study of the dynamics in marine fish larvae is notoriously difficult,
   given their minute size in a vast, complex and variable marine
   environment. We demonstrate a novel statistical approach, utilizing a
   panel of 19 annual hatchdate distributions, to unravel environmental and
   potential harvesting effects on the spawning, hatching and survival
   processes for walleye pollock in the Gulf of Alaska. Hatchdates are
   determined from counting daily increments on otoliths of larvae. The
   hatchdate frequency distribution determined from sampling a population
   of larvae depends on factors influencing birth and death processes, i.e.
   spawning times and survival rates. Using a nonlinear and partly
   parametric statistical model, temperature, strong winds, and the age
   frequency of spawning adults were found to strongly influence
   hatchdates. Moreover, the interaction of both a climate regime shift and
   the `Exxon Valdez' oil spill in 1989 suppressed pollock larval abundance
   in 1989, with geometrically diminishing after-effects lasting until
   around 1992. The novel method presented here provides a general
   framework for unlocking the rich information hidden in hatchdate data

Abstract = {{The Henares-Jarama-Tajo river system is the largest drainage basin in
   the Province of Madrid, Spain. This area is characterized by the
   presence of intensive urban and industrial activities influenced by a
   continental Mediterranean climate with rainfalls presenting substantial
   fluctuations along the different seasons. This research aimed to monitor
   seasonal variations in concentrations of 22 pharmaceutically active
   compounds (PhACs) in this river system and to establish the potential
   risk of sublethal effects on aquatic organisms. A total of 10 sampling
   sites were selected along the river system with samples collected in
   each of the four seasons during a year-round schedule. Most of the PhACs
   detected were present in sampling sites downstream in the vicinity of
   the most populated cities (i.e. Madrid, Guadalajara and Alcala de
   Henares). Only two PhACs, fluoxetine and paraxantine, were detected in
   all sites regardless of the season, and showed median (+/- interquartile
   range) concentrations of 21.4 (+/- 31.2) ng L(-1) and 8.5 (+/- 5.3) ng
   L(-1), respectively. Other PhACs were detected with a frequency >80\%

   ibuprofen, ketoprofen. diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, atenolol, naproxen,
   carbamazepine and propanolol. Seasonal variations were observed with the

   combining measured environmental concentrations with toxicity data
   (either publicly available or obtained experimentally in our
   laboratory), and by calculating an Maximum Risk Index (MaxRI) that each
   combination of PhACs should have for non exceeding the risk threshold, a
   high potential for long-term risk (MaxRI < 10) was estimated for most of
   the sampling sites and sampling dates. This research allowed the
   characterization of the potential risk for each of the PhACs to exert
   sublethal effects on aquatic organisms using acute screening methods,

   spatial distribution patterns. This distribution is a result of changes
   in the soil properties induced by cultivation practices in farmland. The
   estimated probability maps created by disjunctive kriging also indicated
   that the probability of exceeding the threshold value for available Cd
   (0.8 mg/kg) is high in farmland where total cadmium concentrations are
   low. The discriminant analysis conducted in this study revealed that the
   two main land use patterns (farmland and pasture) are different in terms

   showed that soil pH was the most important factor controlling the
   availability of cadmium in soils. Due to obvious decreases in soil pH
   caused by extended use of ammonium-based fertilizers on the farmland,
   unavailable cadmium in soil has apparently became more available. This

Abstract = {{Gully erosion represents an important soil degradation process in
   rangelands. In order to take preventive or control measures and to
   reduce its environmental damages and economical costs it is useful to
   localize the points in the landscape where gullying takes place and to
   determine the importance of the different factors involved. The study is
   carried out in Extremadura, southwest Spain. The main objectives of this
   work are: (a) comparing two nonparametric schemes to model the potential
   distribution of gullies, (b) evaluating the importance of the different
   factors involved in gullying processes, (c) analyzing the role of
   prevalence in the success of the model and finally, (d) implementing and
   mapping the results with the help of a Geographical Information System
   (GIS). Two methods were used to model the response of a dependent
   variable (gullying) from a set of independent variables: Classification
   And Regression Trees (CART) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines
   (MARS). Three different datasets were used; the first one for
   constructing the model (training dataset) and the others for validating
   the model (external datasets). These datasets are formed by a target
   variable (presence or absence of gullies) and a set of independent
   variables. The dependent variable was obtained by mapping the locations
   of gullies with the help of a GPS and high resolution aerial
   ortopholographs. A set of 32 independent variables reflecting
   topography, lithology, soil type, climate, land use and vegetation cover
   of each area were used. The performance of the models was evaluated
   using a non-dependent threshold method: the Receiver Operating
   Characteristic (ROC) curve. The results showed a better performance of
   MARS for predicting gullying with areas under the ROC curve of 0.98 and
   0.97 for the validation datasets, while CART presented values of 0.96

   between occurrence data and underlying environmental conditions are
   increasingly used to predict spatial patterns of biological invasions
   and prioritize locations for early detection and control of invasion
   outbreaks. However, invasive species distribution models (iSDMs) face
   special challenges because (i) they typically violate SDM's assumption
   that the organism is in equilibrium with its environment, and (ii)
   species absence data are often unavailable or believed to be too
   difficult to interpret. This often leads researchers to generate
   pseudo-absences for model training or utilize presence-only methods, and
   to confuse the distinction between predictions of potential vs. actual
   distribution. We examined the hypothesis that true-absence data, when
   accompanied by dispersal constraints, improve prediction accuracy and
   ecological understanding of iSDMs that aim to predict the actual
   distribution of biological invasions. We evaluated the impact of
   presence-only, true-absence and pseudo-absence data on model accuracy
   using an extensive dataset on the distribution of the invasive forest
   pathogen Phytophthora ramorum in California. Two traditional
   presence/absence models (generalized linear model and classification
   trees) and two alternative presence-only models (ecological niche factor
   analysis and maximum entropy) were developed based on 890 field plots of
   pathogen occurrence and several climatic, topographic, host vegetation
   and dispersal variables. The effects of all three possible types of
   occurrence data on model performance were evaluated with receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) and omission/commission error rates.
   Results show that prediction of actual distribution was less accurate
   when we ignored true-absences and dispersal constraints. Presence-only
   models and models without dispersal information tended to over-predict
   the actual range of invasions. Models based on pseudo-absence data
   exhibited similar accuracies as presence-only models but produced
   spatially less feasible predictions. We suggest that true-absence data
   are a critical ingredient not only for accurate calibration but also for
   ecologically meaningful assessment of iSDMs that focus on predictions of
   actual distributions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrogeomorphology and ecology of rivers and streams has been
   subject of intensive research for many decades. However,
   hydraulically-generated acoustics have been mostly neglected, even
   though this physical attribute is a robust signal in fluvial ecosystems.
   Physical generated underwater sound can be used to quantify
   hydro-geomorphic processes, to differentiate among aquatic habitat
   types, and it has implications on the behavior of organisms. In this
   study, acoustic signals were quantified in a flume by varying
   hydro-geomorphic drivers and the related turbulence and bubble
   formation. The acoustic signals were recorded using two hydrophones and
   analyzed using a signal processing software, over 31 third-octave bands
   (20 Hz-20 kHz), and then combined in 10 octave bands. The analytical
   method allowed for a major improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio,
   therefore greatly reducing the uncertainty in our analyses. Water
   velocity, relative submergence, and flow obstructions were manipulated
   in the flume and the resultant acoustic signals recorded. Increasing
   relative submergence ratio and water velocity were important for
   reaching a turbulence threshold above which distinct sound levels were
   generated. Increases in water velocity resulted in increased sound
   levels over a wide range of frequencies. The increases in sound levels
   due to relative submergence of obstacles were most pronounced in
   midrange frequencies (125 Hz-2 kHz). Flow obstructions in running waters
   created turbulence and air bubble formation, which again produced
   specific sound signatures.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat thresholds are usually defined as ``points of abrupt change{''}
   in the species-habitat relationships. Habitat thresholds can be a key
   tool for understanding species requirements, and provide an objective
   definition of conservation targets, by identifying when habitat loss
   leads to a rapid loss of species, and the minimum amount of habitat
   necessary for species persistence. However, a large variety of
   statistical methods have been used to analyse them. In this context, we
   reviewed these methods and, using simulated data sets, we tested the
   main models to compare their performance on the identification of
   thresholds. We show that researchers use very different analytical
   tools, corresponding to different operational definitions of habitat
   thresholds, which can considerably affect their detection. Piecewise
   regression and generalized additive models allow both the distinction
   between linear and nonlinear dynamics, and the correct identification of
   break point position. In contrast, other methods such as logistic
   regression fail because they may incorrectly detect thresholds in
   gradual patterns, or they may over or underestimate the threshold
   position. In conservation or habitat modelling, it is important to focus
   efforts efficiently and the inappropriate choice of statistical methods
   may have detrimental consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   To determine whether different abundances of introduced species of
   Cinchona (Rubiaceae) affect species composition and facilitate species
   richness in managed tropical forests, to test whether any facilitative
   effects on understorey species depend on forest type, and to investigate
   whether facilitative effects can be attributed to the `substitutive
   facilitation model'.
   Location
   Makawao Forest Reserve on Maui, Hawai'i, USA.
   Methods
   Cinchona species (Cinchona pubescens and Cinchona calisaya) were mapped
   within various forest types. In three forest types (ageing Eucalyptus
   and Pinus plantations, and near-natural Acacia koa forests), we analysed
   environmental parameters (e.g. canopy cover, litter cover, pH value and
   soil depth) and the species composition of Cinchona-invaded and
   non-invaded plots; data were compared based on Cinchona cover and forest
   types. Habitat modelling for several endemic species and tree ferns was
   carried out to test whether Cinchona cover is an important variable for
   the probability of occurrence of these endemics.
   Results
   Cinchona species have naturalized mainly in Eucalyptus and Pinus
   plantations and Acacia koa forests and here add an additional shrub
   layer. In contrast to other studies, we revealed facilitative effects of
   Cinchona on native species within all forest types. Species richness is
   about 20\% higher in invaded plots than in non-invaded plots, and these
   show a nearly 50\% higher proportion of endemic species, including tree
   ferns. The proportion of endemics even increases with increasing
   Cinchona cover. For several endemics, Cinchona is found to be an
   important variable for the probability of occurrence, and the removal of
   Cinchona cover as an explanatory variable lowers the model fit. In
   addition to Cinchona, variables delineating vegetation structure and
   light availability have a strong effect on the model fit.
   Main conclusions
   In the structurally simplified Hawaiian forests studied, Cinchona
   facilitated endemic species in accordance with the `substitutive
   facilitation model'. This contrasts with the results of an earlier study
   in the naturally treeless Galapagos highlands, which revealed a sharp
   decrease in the abundance of endemics under Cinchona canopy. These
   results illustrate that, through the same structural change (addition of
   a vegetation layer), an invasive species may exert divergent effects
   across different ecosystem types. The facilitation of endemic
   understorey species by invasive tree species in managed forests leads to
   a dilemma in conservation but also to new perspectives for ecosystem
   restoration.}},

Title = {{Effects of changing rice cultural practices on C-band synthetic aperture
   radar backscatter using Envisat advanced synthetic aperture radar data
   in the Mekong River Delta}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Changes in rice cultivation systems have been observed in the Mekong
   River Delta, Vietnam. Among the changes in cultural practices, the
   change from transplanting to direct sowing, the use of water-saving
   technology, and the use of high production method could have impacts on
   radar remote sensing methods previously developed for rice monitoring.
   Using Envisat (Environmental Satellite) ASAR (Advanced Synthetic
   Aperture Radar) data over the province of An Giang, this study showed
   that the radar backscattering behaviour is much different from that of
   the reported traditional rice. At the early stage of the season, direct
   sowing on fields with rough and wet soil surface provides very high
   backscatter values for HH (Horizontal transmit - Horizontal receive
   polarisation) and VV (Vertical transmit - Vertical receive polarisation)
   data, as a contrast compared to the very low backscatter of fields
   covered with water before emergence. The temporal increase of the
   backscatter is therefore not observed clearly over direct sowing fields.
   Hence, the use of the intensity temporal change as a rice classifier
   proposed previously may not apply. Due to the drainage that occurs
   during the season, HH, VV and HH/VV are not strongly related to biomass,
   in contrast with past results. However, HH/VV ratio could be used to
   derive the rice/non-rice classification algorithm for all conditions of
   rice fields in the test province. The mapping results using the HH/VV
   polarization ratio at a single date in the middle period of the rice
   season were assessed using statistical data at different districts in
   the province, where very high accuracy was found. The method can be
   applied to other regions, provided that the synthetic aperture radar
   data are acquired during the peak period of the rice season, and that
   few training fields provide adjusted threshold values used in the
   method.}},

Abstract = {{It is a current challenge to better understand the relative importance
   of species in ecosystems, and the network perspective is able to offer
   quantitative tools for this. It is plausible to assume, in general, that
   well-linked species, being key interactors, are also more important for
   the community. Recently a number of methods have been suggested for
   quantifying the network position of species in ecological networks (like
   the topological importance metric, TI). Most of them are based on node
   centrality indices and it may happen that the two most important species
   in a food web have very similar interaction structure and they can
   essentially replace each other if one becomes extinct. For conservation
   considerations it is a challenge to identify species that are richly
   connected and, at the same time, have a relatively unique and
   irreplaceable interaction pattern. We present a new method and
   illustrate our approach by using the Kuosheng Bay trophic network in
   Taiwan. The new method is based on the interaction matrix, where the
   strength of the interaction between nodes i and j depends only on
   topology. By defining a threshold separating weak and strong
   interactors, we define the effective range of interactions for each
   graph node. If the overlaps between pairs of these ranges are
   quantified, we gain a metric expressing how unique is the interaction
   pattern of a focal node (TO). The combination of centrality (TI) and
   uniqueness (TO) is called topological functionality (TF). We compare the
   nodal importance rank provided by this metric to others based on a
   variety of centrality measures. The main conclusion is that shrimps seem
   to have the most unique interaction pattern despite that their
   structural importance has been underestimated by all conventional
   centrality indices. Also, our network analysis suggests that fisheries
   disturb the ecosystem in a more critical network position than the
   impingement by the local power plant. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2125-2135}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   Members of the crustacean family Lithodidae share preferences for
   cold-water environments; however, the specific role of temperature in
   governing lithodid biogeography has not been examined to date. In the
   present study this relationship was quantified through the analysis of
   habitat data, and the results were interpreted in the light of previous
   physiological studies. It was hypothesized that lineage-specific
   temperature thresholds underlie differences in the distribution of the
   two lithodid subfamilies.
   Location
   The family Lithodidae is divided into the subfamilies Hapalogastrinae
   and Lithodinae. The Hapalogastrinae inhabit depths of between 0 and 200
   m in the North Pacific. The Lithodinae are distributed globally in the
   deep sea, with a few genera occurring intertidally at high latitudes.
   Methods
   Descriptions of 86 species of lithodids, sampled at 627 locations
   worldwide, were obtained from a wide range of published and original
   sources. For each specimen, the water temperature at the time and
   locality of collection was recorded. Molecular sequence data for the
   16S, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 28S genes were analysed to
   construct a phylogenetic tree for the major lithodid genera, using a
   maximum likelihood method in the program paup. Further analyses examined
   the link between the habitat temperature range and the position of taxa
   within the lithodid phylogeny.
   Results
   Phylogenetic evidence indicated that the deep-water lithodid lineages
   had ancestors that inhabited the coastal waters of the North Pacific.
   Adults of North Pacific lithodid taxa were found in regions where water
   temperatures ranged from 0 to 25 degrees C; however, deep-water lineages
   of the Lithodinae were excluded from waters exceeding temperatures of 13
   degrees C. Despite the higher temperatures tolerated by adults, North
   Pacific intertidal/subtidal genera were restricted to regions that had
   water temperatures lower than 16 degrees C during periods of larval
   development.
   Main conclusions
   Temperature has restricted the range of most shallow-water genera of
   Lithodidae to the coastline of the North Pacific since the early history
   of the family. Distribution in these groups remains constrained by the
   detrimental effects of temperature extremes on early life-history
   stages. Deep-water lineages moved away from seasonal temperature
   fluctuations, and underwent at least three radiations into water bodies
   outside the North Pacific. Species from within the deep-water lineages
   currently live close to the threshold of their temperature tolerance in
   the Southern Ocean, and their future distribution may be affected by
   increases in ocean temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Databases on effects of chronic low-LET radiation exposure were analyzed

   rates at which effects were reported without further details about the
   size or peculiarity of the effects. In total, the data sets include 84
   values for endpoint ``morbidity{''}, 77 values for reproduction, and 41
   values for life shortening. The dose rates in each set were ranked from
   low to higher values. The threshold TDR5 for radiation effects of a

   small percentage (5\%) of data reported statistically significant
   radiation effects. The statistical treatment of the data sets was
   performed using non-parametric order statistics, and the bootstrap

Abstract = {{The land management of US Army installations requires information on
   land conditions and their history for planning future military training
   activities and allocation of land repair. There is thus a strong need
   for methodology development to estimate the land conditions and
   cumulative military training impacts for the purpose of repair and
   restoration. In this study, we simulated at Fort Riley, USA, spatial
   patterns and temporal dynamics of military training impacts on land
   conditions quantified as percent ground cover using an image-aided
   spatial conditional co-simulation algorithm. Moreover, we estimated the
   historical percent ground cover as a measure of the cumulative impacts,
   and then calculated the allocation of land repair and restoration based
   on both current and historical land conditions. In addition, we
   developed a loss function method for allocation of land repair and
   restoration. The results showed: (1) this co-simulation algorithm
   reproduced spatial and temporal variability of percent ground cover and
   provided estimates of uncertainties with the correlation coefficients
   and root mean square errors between the simulated and observed values
   varying from 0.63 to 0.88 and from 23\% to 78\%, respectively; (2) with
   and without the cumulative impacts, the obtained spatial patterns of the
   land repair categories were similar, but their land areas differed by
   5\% to 40\% in some years; (3) the combination of the loss function with
   the co-simulation made it possible to estimate and computationally
   propagate the uncertainties of land conditions into the uncertainties of
   expected cost loss for misallocation of land repair and restoration; and
   (4) the loss function, physical threshold, and probability threshold
   methods led to similar spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of the
   land repair categories, however, the loss function increased the land
   area by 5\% to 30\% for intense and moderate repairs and decreased the
   area by 5\% to 30\% for no repairs and light repairs for most of the
   years. This approach provided the potential to improve and automate the
   existing land rehabilitation and maintenance (LRAM) system used for the
   land management of the U. S. Army installations, and it can be applied
   to the management of other civil lands and environments. In conclusion,
   this study overcame the important gaps that exist in the methodological
   development and application for simulating land conditions and
   cumulative impacts due to human activities, and also in the methods for
   the allocation of land for repair and restoration.}},

   cycle assessment(LCA) and requires a minimum amount of input data.
   Impact is minimal when evapotranspiration is equal to that of the
   potential natural vegetation, and maximal when evapotranspiration is
   zero or when it exceeds a threshold value derived from die concept of
   environmental water requirement Three refinements to the model,
   requiring more input data, are proposed. The first refinement considers
   a minimal impact over a certain range based on the boundary
   evapotranspiration of the potential natural vegetation. In the second
   refinement the effects of evaporation and transpiration are accounted
   for separately, and in the third refinement a more correct estimate of
   evaporation from a fully sealed surface is incorporated. The simplicity
   and user friendliness of the proposed impact assessment method are
   illustrated with two examples.}},

Abstract = {{One method of assessing the impact of ETS (environmental tobacco smoke)
   on employees in the catering industry is to determine ETS elements in
   dust deposits. Dust samples were taken using a dust extractor certified
   for this purpose and the nicotine and PAH (polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbon) concentration was determined analytically. This shows that
   the benzo{[}a]pyrene content of dust is suitable as a parameter for the
   long-term impact of ETS. As well as the number of cigarettes smoked,
   ventilation conditions and room size, the concentration of nicotine and
   benzo{[}a]pyrene in dust deposits is also influenced by the type of
   floor covering in the rooms examined. A comparison with background
   levels after refurbishment following a fire shows that the PAH
   concentration in dust deposits in eating and drinking areas is well
   below the threshold values set for industrial companies.}},

Abstract = {{1. A recent and controversial topic in landscape ecology is whether
   populations of species respond to habitat fragmentation in a general
   fashion. Empirical research has provided mixed support, resulting in
   controversy about the use of general rules in landscape management.
   Rather than simply assessing post hoc whether individual species follow
   such rules, a priori testing could shed light on their accuracy and
   utility for predicting species response to landscape change.
   2. We aim to create an a priori model that predicts the presence or
   absence of multiple species in habitat patches. Our goal is to balance
   general theory with relevant species life-history traits to obtain high
   prediction accuracy. To increase the utility of this work, we aim to use
   accessible methods that can be applied using readily available
   inexpensive resources.
   3. The classification tree patch-occupancy model we create for birds is
   based on habitat suitability, minimum area requirements, dispersal
   potential of each species and overall landscape connectivity.
   4. To test our model we apply it to the South East Queensland region,
   Australia, for 17 bird species with varying dispersal potential and
   habitat specialization. We test the accuracy of our predictions using
   presence-absence information for 55 vegetation patches.
   5. Overall we achieve Cohen's kappa of 0.33, or `fair' agreement between
   the model predictions and test data sets, and generally a very high
   level of absence prediction accuracy. Habitat specialization appeared to
   influence the accuracy of the model for different species.
   6. We also compare the a priori model to the statistically derived model
   for each species. Although this `optimal model' generally differed from
   our original predictive model, the process revealed ways in which it
   could be improved for future attempts.
   7. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that ecological
   generalizations alongside basic resources (a vegetation map and some
   species-specific information) can provide conservative accuracy for
   predicting species occupancy in remnant vegetation patches. We show that
   the process of testing and developing models based on general rules
   could provide basic tools for conservation managers to understand the
   impact of current or planned landscape change on wildlife populations.}},

   tree cover on abrupt change in species composition of alpine communities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aims: The upper elevation limit of forest vegetation in mountain ranges
   (the alpine treeline ecotone) is expected to be highly sensitive to
   global change. Treeline shifts and/ or ecotone afforestation could cause
   fragmentation and loss of alpine habitat, and are expected to trigger
   considerable alterations in alpine vegetation. We performed an analysis
   of vegetation structure at the treeline ecotone to evaluate whether
   distribution of the tree population determines the spatial pattern of
   vegetation (species composition and diversity) across the transition
   from subalpine forest to alpine vegetation.
   Location: lberian eastern range of the Pyrenees.
   Methods: We Studied 12 alpine Pinus uncinata treeline ecotones.
   Rectangular plots ranging from 940 to 1900 in 2 were placed along the
   forest-alpine vegetation transition, from closed forest to the treeless
   alpine area. To determine community structure and species distribution
   in the treeline ecotone, species variation along the forest-alpine
   vegetation transition was sampled using releves of 0.5 m(2) set every 2
   m along the length of each plot. Fuzzy C-means clustering was performed
   to assess the transitional status of the releves in terms of species
   composition. The relation of P. uncinata canopy cover to spatial pattern
   of vegetation was evaluated using continuous wavelet transform analysis.
   Results: Vegetation analyses revealed a large degree of uniformity of
   the subalpine forest between all treeline ecotone areas studied. In
   contrast, the vegetation mosaic found upslope displayed great variation
   between sites and was characterized by abrupt changes in plant community
   across the treeline ecotone. Plant richness and diversity significantly
   increased across the ecotone, but tree cover and diversity boundaries
   were not spatially coincident.
   Conclusions: Our results revealed that no intermediate communities, in
   terms of species composition, are present in the treeline ecotone.
   Ecotone vegetation reflected both bedrock type and fine-scale
   heterogeneity at ground level, thereby reinforcing the importance of
   microenvironmental conditions for alpine community composition. Tree
   cover did not appear to be the principal driver of alpine community
   changes across the treeline ecotone. Micro-environmental heterogeneity,
   together with effects of past climatic and land-use changes on ecotone
   vegetation, may weaken the expected correlation between species
   distribution and vegetation structure.}},

Abstract = {{Mapping urban areas at regional and global scales has become an urgent
   task because of the increasing pressures from rapid urbanization and
   associated environmental problems. Satellite imaging of stable
   anthropogenic lights from DMSP-OLS provides an accurate, economical, and
   straightforward way to map the global distribution of urban areas. To
   address problems in the thresholding methods that use empirical
   strategies or manual trial-and-error procedures, we proposed a support
   vector machine (SVM)-based region-growing algorithm to
   semi-automatically extract urban areas from DMSP-OLS and SPOT NDVI data.
   Several simple criteria were used to select SVM training sets of urban
   and non-urban pixels, and an iterative classification and training
   procedure was adopted to identify the urban pixels through region
   growing. The new method was validated using the extents of 25 Chinese
   cities, as classified by Landsat ETM + images, and then compared with
   two common thresholding methods. The results showed that the SVM-based
   algorithm could not only achieve comparable results to the
   local-optimized threshold method, but also avoid its tedious
   trial-and-error procedure, suggesting that the new method is an easy and
   simple alternative for extracting urban extent from DMSP-OLS and SPOT

   N-15 and delta O-18(NO3), with a epsilon N/epsilon O ratio of 1.8,
   consistent with denitrification processes. The link between
   denitrification and pyrite oxidation is demonstrated by coupling
   chemical data with nitrate and sulfate isotopes. Furthermore, a spatial
   distribution of samples with significant denitrification was observed,
   allowing us to determine two main hydrogeological zones where natural
   attenuation was most effective. In several of the studied points,
   denitrification processes related to pyrite oxidation predominated and
   an estimation of the isotopic enrichment factors was performed using the
   temporal variations of nitrate concentration and the isotopic
   composition of dissolved nitrate (delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO3)).
   Finally, using estimated isotopic enrichment factors, an approximation
   of the degree of natural attenuation of nitrate was performed on those
   samples showing clear denitrification, and a median value of 30\% of
   contaminant diminution was obtained. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In the beginning of the 21st century, it is obvious that health and
   environmental matters are among the most important political and
   societal topics. The various kinds of pollution (e.g. air pollution,
   soil pollution, water contamination) are responsible for significant
   health and environmental degradation. In order to adequately deal with
   pollution issues, it is important to better understand the acting
   processes and to be able to account for specific knowledge about the
   pollutant. Thanks to this, it will be possible to forecast pollutant
   concentrations so that efficient actions can be rapidly taken. Based on
   a Bayesian data fusion (BDF) framework, the present paper proposes a
   methodology for air pollutant forecasting using the space-time
   properties of the process and several secondary information sources that
   contribute to a better understanding of the pollutant behavior (e.g.
   meteorological variables and anthropogenic activities). Consequently,
   the present work can contribute to improving the representation and the
   forecast of pollutant fields. Moreover the developed approach also
   permits to predict the probability of exceeding a given threshold, as
   required in official regulations for some pollutants (e.g. the European
   directives). The BDF framework is applied here to the case of space-time
   predictions of air concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Belgium.
   After a detailed description of some specific assumptions, results
   showed that BDF is able to successfully account for secondary
   information sources, thus leading to meaningful NO2 predictions. (C)

Abstract = {{Ten brands of spent portable rechargeable batteries used in mobile

   Similarly, the mean values of cobalt, chromium, nickel and cadmium in

   45 times the toxicity threshold limit concentration limit for cobalt
   while the mean nickel result is about 38 times the toxicity threshold
   limit concentration. Spent portable rechargeable batteries should be

   Methods: In three landscapes with different deforestation levels (HDL =
   4\%; IDL = 11\%; and LDL = 24\% of remaining forest cover) liana
   communities (DBH >= 2.5 cm) were characterized in 15 randomly selected

   Results: A total of 64 taxa and 24 families were sampled. Species
   composition differed highly among landscapes, with HDL being the most
   dissimilar landscape. The response of lianas to landscape spatial
   pattern differed significantly among landscapes. Proximity to villages
   had a strong positive effect on species and stem densities in LDL and

   Conclusions: Fragmentation may have a positive effect oil lianas, partly

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a literature review of methods and determinants
   relevant for modelling farm structural change within an integrated
   modelling chain. Environmental and economic impacts at farm level and
   individual farm responses to agricultural and agri-environmental
   policies strongly depend on characteristics like farm size,
   specialisation, and production intensity. Consequently, up-scaling
   results of corresponding farm type models in ex-ante assessment
   exercises requires comprehensive and valid predictions of the farm
   types' future relevance under different scenarios. The paper reviews
   methods relevant to forecasting farm numbers in classes defined by farm
   typologies with the objective to identify (1) a preferable modelling
   approach and (2) empirically relevant determinants. Despite the
   literature's considerable size, even recent studies are rather limited
   in scope and typically restricted to a subset of farm types and one or
   very few regions. With regard to data availability, computational
   complexity and statistical validation procedures, Markov chain models
   are identified as the only generally suitable method for a broadly
   scoped modelling approach across European regions and a differentiated
   farm typology. However, other research on determinants of farm growth,
   the number of farm holders, farm succession as well as new multi-agent
   based simulation approaches hint at relevant explanatory variables
   previously not considered in Markov chain analyses. Their impact seems
   testable in more ambitious cross-regional and cross-farm type setups.

Abstract = {{Aim To evaluate a suite of species distribution models for their utility
   as predictors of suitable habitat and as tools for new population
   discovery of six rare plant species that have both narrow geographical
   ranges and specialized habitat requirements.
   Location The Rattlesnake Creek Terrane (RCT) of the Shasta-Trinity
   National Forest in the northern California Coast Range of the United
   States.
   Methods We used occurrence records from 25 years of US Forest Service
   botanical surveys, environmental and remotely sensed climate data to
   model the distributions of the target species across the RCT. The models
   included generalized linear models (GLM), artificial neural networks
   (ANN), random forests (RF) and maximum entropy (ME). From the results we
   generated predictive maps that were used to identify areas of high
   probability occurrence. We made field visits to the top-ranked sites to
   search for new populations of the target species.
   Results Random forests gave the best results according to area under the
   curve and Kappa statistics, although ME was in close agreement. While
   GLM and ANN also gave good results, they were less restrictive and more
   varied than RF and ME. Cross-model correlations were the highest for
   species with the most records and declined with record numbers. Model
   assessment using a separate dataset confirmed that RF provided the best
   predictions of appropriate habitat. Use of RF output to prioritize
   search areas resulted in the discovery of 16 new populations of the
   target species.
   Main conclusions Species distribution models, such as RF and ME, which
   use presence data and information about the background matrix where
   species do not occur, may be an effective tool for new population
   discovery of rare plant species, but there does appear to be a lower
   threshold in the number of occurrences required to build a good model.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between vegetation and. re have the potential to overshadow
   direct effects of climate change on. re regimes in boreal forests of

   with. re regimes simulated by an ecological model, ALFRESCO (Alaskan
   Frame-based Ecosystem Code) and apply these methods to evaluate
   potential causes of a mid-Holocene. re-regime shift in boreal forests of
   the south-central Brooks Range, Alaska, USA. Fire-return intervals
   (FRIs, number of years between. res) are estimated over the past 7000
   calibrated C-14 years (7-0 kyr BP {[}before present]) from short-term
   variations in charcoal accumulation rates (CHARs) at three lakes, and an
   index of area burned is inferred from long-term CHARs at these sites.
   ALFRESCO simulations of FRIs and annual area burned are based on
   prescribed vegetation and climate for 7-5 kyr BP and 5-0 kyr BP,
   inferred from pollen and stomata records and qualitative paleoclimate
   proxies. Two sets of experiments examine potential causes of increased
   burning between 7-5 and 5-0 kyr BP. (1) Static-vegetation scenarios:
   white spruce dominates with static mean temperature and total
   precipitation of the growing season for 7-0 kyr BP or with decreased
   temperature and/or increased precipitation for 5-0 kyr BP. (2)
   Changed-vegetation scenarios: black spruce dominates 5-0 kyr BP, with
   static temperature and precipitation or decreased temperature and/or
   increased precipitation. Median FRIs decreased between 7-5 and 5-0 kyr
   BP in empirical data and changed-vegetation scenarios but remained
   relatively constant in static-vegetation scenarios. Median empirical and
   simulated FRIs are not statistically different for 7-5 kyr BP and for
   two changed-vegetation scenarios (temperature decrease, precipitation
   increase) for 5-0 kyr BP. In these scenarios, cooler temperatures or
   increased precipitation dampened the effect of increased landscape
   flammability resulting from the increase in black spruce. CHAR records
   and all changed-vegetation scenarios indicate long-term increases in
   area burned between 7-5 and 5-0 kyr BP. The similarity of CHAR and
   ALFRESCO results demonstrates the compatibility of these independent
   data sets for investigating ecological mechanisms causing past
   fire-regime changes. The finding that vegetation flammability was a
   major driver of Holocene fire regimes is consistent with other
   investigations that suggest that landscape fuel characteristics will
   mediate the direct effects of future climate change on boreal fire
   regimes.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Developmental exposure to a wide variety of developmental
   neurotoxicants, including organophosphate pesticides, evokes
   late-emerging and persistent abnormalities in acetylcholine (ACh)
   systems. We are seeking interventions that can ameliorate or reverse the
   effects later in life.
   OBJECTIVES: We administered parathion to neonatal rats and then
   evaluated whether a high-fat diet begun in adulthood could reverse the
   effects on ACh systems.
   METHODS: Neonatal rats received parathion on postnatal days 1-4 at 0.1
   or 0.2 mg/kg/day, straddling the cholinesterase inhibition threshold. In
   adulthood, half the animals were switched to a high-fat diet for 8
   weeks. We assessed three indices of ACh synaptic function: nicotinic ACh
   receptor binding, choline acetyltransferase activity, and
   hemicholinium-3 binding. Determinations were performed in brain regions
   comprising all the major ACh projections and cell bodies.
   RESULTS: Neonatal parathion exposure evoked widespread abnormalities in
   ACh synaptic markers, encompassing effects in brain regions possessing
   ACh projections and ACh cell bodies. In general, males were affected
   more than females. Of 17 regional ACh market abnormalities (10 male, 7
   female), 15 were reversed by the high-fat diet.
   CONCLUSIONS: A high-fat diet reverses neurodevelopmental effects of
   neonatal parathion exposure on ACh systems. This points to the potential
   for nonpharmacologic interventions to offset the effects of
   developmental neurotoxicants. Further, cryptic neurodevelopmental
   deficits evoked by environmental exposures may thus engender a later
   preference for a high-fat diet to maintain normal ACh function,
   ultimately contributing to obesity.}},

Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{484-488}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of low-level radioactivity often give results of the order
   of the detection limit. For many applications, interest is not only in
   estimating activity concentrations of a single radioactive isotope, but
   focuses on multi-isotope analyses, which often enable inference on the
   source of the activity detected (e.g. from activity ratios). Obviously,
   such conclusions become questionable if the measurement merely gives a
   detection limit for a specific isotope. This is particularly relevant if
   the presence of an isotope, which shows a low signal only (e.g. due to a
   short half-life or a small transition probability), is crucial for
   gaining the information of interest.
   This paper discusses a new approach which has the potential to solve
   these problems. Using Bayesian statistics, a method is presented which
   allows statistical inference on nuclide ratios taking into account both
   prior knowledge and all information collected from the measurements. it
   is shown that our method allows quantitative conclusion to be drawn if
   counts of single isotopes are low or become even negative after
   background subtraction. Differences to the traditional statistical
   approach of specifying decision thresholds or detection limits are
   highlighted.
   Application of this new approach is illustrated by a number of examples
   of environmental low-level radioactivity measurements. The capabilities
   of our approach for spectrum interpretation and source identification
   are demonstrated with real spectra from air filters, sewage sludge and
   soil samples. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical techniques can be used in groundwater pollution problems to
   determine the relationships among observed contamination (impacted wells
   representing an occurrence of what has to be predicted), environmental
   factors that may influence it and the potential contamination sources.
   Determination of a threshold concentration to discriminate between
   impacted or non impacted wells represents a key issue in the application
   of these techniques. In this work the effects on groundwater
   vulnerability assessment by statistical methods due to the use of
   different threshold values have been evaluated. The study area (Province
   of Milan, northern Italy) is about 2000 km(2) and groundwater nitrate
   concentration is constantly monitored by a net of about 300 wells. Along
   with different predictor factors three different threshold values of
   nitrate concentration have been considered to perform the vulnerability
   assessment of the shallow unconfined aquifer. The likelihood ratio model
   has been chosen to analyze the spatial distribution of the vulnerable
   areas. The reliability of the three final vulnerability maps has been
   tested showing that all maps identify a general positive trend relating
   mean nitrate concentration in the wells and vulnerability classes the
   same wells belong to. Then using the kappa coefficient the influence of
   the different threshold values has been evaluated comparing the spatial
   distribution of the resulting vulnerability classes in each map. The use
   of different threshold does not determine different vulnerability
   assessment if results are analyzed on a broad scale, even if the smaller
   threshold value gives the poorest performance in terms of reliability.
   On the contrary, the spatial distribution of a detailed vulnerability
   assessment is strongly influenced by the selected threshold used to
   identify the occurrences, suggesting that there is a strong relationship
   among the number of identified occurrences, the scale of the maps
   representing the predictor factors and the model efficiency in
   discriminating different vulnerable areas. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The control of pests by their natural enemies represents an important
   regulating ecosystem service that helps maintain the stability of crop
   ecosystems. These services, however, are often ignored in pest
   management decision making. In addition, the use of broad-spectrum
   insecticides can damage the populations of natural enemies, reducing the
   cost-effectiveness of insecticide investment if unaccounted for in
   treatment decisions.
   The existing literature on modeling of biological control of insect
   pests has generally focused on simulations of the population dynamics of
   pest and natural enemy species and the processes underlying pest
   control. But agriculture is a managed ecosystem where predator-prey
   relationships are heavily influenced by human managers. In modeling
   managerial choices, this study develops an intra-seasonal dynamic
   bioeconomic optimization model for insecticide-based pest management
   that explicitly takes into account both the biological control effect of
   natural enemies on pest density and the nontarget mortality effect of
   insecticides on the level of natural pest control supplied. The model
   captures predator-prey interactions, linking them to crop growth and
   yield damage functions, which in turn are evaluated in a dynamic
   optimization framework. We introduce a new decision rule for judicious
   insecticide decisions using a natural enemy-adjusted economic threshold.
   This threshold represents the pest population density at which
   insecticide control becomes optimal in spite of the opportunity cost of
   injury to natural enemies of the target pest. Using field data from
   Michigan, the model is applied to the case of soybean aphid (Aphis
   glycines, Matsumura), a recent invasive pest of soybean (Glycine max),
   whose management is of both economic and environmental importance to the
   North Central region of the United States. As illustrated by the
   numerical examples, such natural enemy-adjusted threshold is likely to
   lead to fewer recommendations for insecticide use than naive models that
   ignore natural enemies, resulting in less insecticide use, while
   maintaining profitability for farmers that rely on chemical pest control
   methods.
   The bioeconomic model developed in this study can be used to conduct a
   wide variety of analyses such as identifying dynamically optimal spray
   strategies and estimating the implied economic value of natural control
   services. Furthermore, with the incorporation of inter-year carry-over
   factors, such as overwintering of pests and natural enemies, the current
   model can contribute to building multi-year models for studying
   long-term pest management. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Submarine ocean outfalls are commonly used for the disposal of partially
   treated effluents in coastal cities. Typically, the greatest
   environmental risk caused by toxic substances occurs in the near field
   of the outfall discharge. The ecological impact of the effluent varies
   greatly under different discharge and environmental conditions that are
   characterized by both regular and stochastic variations. For a
   comprehensive environmental risk assessment of a coastal discharge, it
   is necessary to determine both the likelihood and severity of the
   adverse effects on the biological community. We present the first
   integrated stochastic (Monte Carlo) environmental risk assessment of a
   major coastal sewage outfall discharge the Stonecutters Island outfall
   of the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme (HATS) in Hong Kong. Unionized
   ammonia (NH3) is used as the target pollutant. To accurately envisage
   the ambient concentrations of NH3, a Lagrangian jet model
   (JETLAG/VISJET) is used to analyze pollutant concentrations in the near
   field of the outfall. The environmental conditions are simulated from 3D
   hydrodynamic model simulations over a 4 month period for typical wet and
   dry seasons. Statistical characteristics of the effluent discharge and
   receiving water temperature are derived from field data. The probability
   distribution of predicted exposure concentrations (EC) is generated from
   this integrated simulation. A species sensitivity distribution, which
   represents a statistical distribution of threshold sublethal effects
   levels or benchmark concentrations (BC) for various marine organisms is
   constructed using available chronic toxicity data. The environmental
   risk of NH3 on the marine community is characterized by computing
   statistical distributions of Hazard Quotient (HQ = ECIBC) using Monte
   Carlo simulation. It is found that the probability of HQ > 1 for HATS
   Stage 1 (1.6 million m(3)/day sewage treated with chemically enhanced
   primary treatment) is around 0.11 for wet season but just about 0.06 for
   the dry season. The risk increases by about 10\% to 0.08-0.13 with
   additional sewage loads of 0.8 million m(3)/day at the same level of
   treatment (HATS Stage 2A). With an upgrade to secondary treatment (HATS
   Stage 2B), the probability will be reduced to 0.03-0.05. Compared to the
   use of ``worst case{''} scenarios or point pollution threshold
   estimates, the present method offers a more holistic ecological
   assessment, and is much less sensitive to arbitrary choice of model
   parameters. The present risk assessment approach can be readily extended
   to the accurate determination of mixing zones based on statistical
   evaluation of ecological risks.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion of land from natural to urban or agricultural cover degrades
   stream ecosystems and results in loss of biodiversity. We compared
   cumulative frequency distributions to measure responses to land use
   gradients for aquatic invertebrate taxa to agricultural, urban, and
   impervious surface cover gradients across the state of Maryland, USA.
   The technique identifies the upper limit threshold above which taxa
   cease to occur as well as a lower limit of detection of effect for
   negatively affected taxa. Urban development and impervious surface cover
   negatively affected the distributions of 44-56\% of the 180 taxa tested,
   depending on region. Across similar taxa, negative responses occurred at
   lower levels of urban land covers in the Piedmont compared to the
   Coastal Plain physiographic province, which suggests that Piedmont
   aquatic biodiversity may be more vulnerable to urbanization. Most taxa
   were capable of tolerating high levels of agricultural development,
   although a number of common taxa in the Coastal Plain and Highlands
   regions were found to be agriculture-sensitive. Some taxa traditionally
   used as indicators were tolerant of very high levels of human-altered
   land uses, suggesting that such taxa require examination prior to use as
   indicators of landscape stressors. Our analysis method appears to be
   sufficiently flexible and sensitive to be used for a variety of taxa and

Abstract = {{A goal of animal movement analysis is to reveal behavioural mechanisms

   Statistical analysis of movement data is complicated by the fact that
   the data are multidimensional, autocorrelated and often marked by error

   data reflect behaviours that are themselves heterogeneous. Here, we
   model movement data as a subsampling of a continuous stochastic
   processes, and introduce the behavioural change point analysis (BCPA), a
   likelihood-based method that allows for the identification of
   significant structural changes. The BCPA is robust to gappiness and
   measurement error, computationally efficient, easy to implement and
   reveals structure that is otherwise difficult to discern. We apply the
   analysis to a GPS movement track of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus
   ursinus), revealing an unexpectedly complex diurnal behavioural profile,
   and demonstrate its robustness to the greater errors associated with the
   ARGOS tracking system. By informing empirical interpretation of movement

   and the environmental conditions that give rise to these threshold
   responses is important for both the scientific community and the
   agencies charged with ecosystem management. A threshold is defined as a
   substantial change in a response variable, given a marginal change in
   environmental conditions. Here, we demonstrate the usefulness of a
   derivative-based method for detecting ecological thresholds along a
   single explanatory variable. The ``significant zero crossings{''}
   (SiZer) approach uses a non-parametric method to approximate the
   response function and its derivatives and then examines how those
   functions change across the range of the explanatory variable. SiZer
   makes fewer assumptions than conventional threshold models and explores
   a full range of smoothing functions. We believe SiZer is a useful
   technique for the exploratory analysis of many ecological datasets.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a method to evaluate the degree to which a meta-model
   approximates spatial disturbance processes represented by a more
   detailed model across a range of landscape conditions, using neutral
   landscapes and equivalence testing. We illustrate this approach by
   comparing burn patterns produced by a relatively simple fire spread
   algorithm with those generated by a more detailed fire behavior model
   from which the simpler algorithm was derived. Equivalence testing allows
   objective comparisons of the output of simple and complex models, to
   determine if the results are significantly similar. Neutral landscape
   models represent a range of landscape conditions that the model may
   encounter, allowing evaluation of the sensitivity and behavior of the
   model to different landscape compositions and configurations. We first
   tested the model for universal applicability, then narrowed the testing
   to assess the practical domain of applicability. As a whole, the
   calibrated simple model passed the test for significant equivalence
   using the 25\% threshold. When applied to a range of landscape
   conditions different from the calibration scenarios, the model failed
   the tests for equivalence. Although our particular model failed the
   tests, the neutral landscape models were helpful in determining an
   appropriate domain of applicability and in assessing the model
   sensitivity to landscape changes. Equivalence testing provides an
   effective method for model comparison, and coupled with neutral
   landscapes, our approach provides an objective way to assess the domain
   of applicability of a spatial model.}},

Abstract = {{Green Public Procurement (GPP) has been considered as an important
   policy instrument in the context of sustainable consumption and
   production. The state and progress of GPP has earlier been measured by
   questionnaires and interviews, both methods being based on the
   assessment by the purchaser, and questionnaires having low response
   rates. Recently, a new method was developed, analyzing the existence of
   environmental criteria in the calls for tenders. However, the studies
   have dealt neither with the progress in GPP, nor the statistical
   evidence of differences between countries. Our aim was to analyze more
   thoroughly whether the differences in the proportions of `green' calls
   for tenders between the three Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland and
   Sweden, in 2003 and 2005 were real, and whether there had occurred any
   progress between the years concerned. The paper also presents the
   `GPP-record' method, which enables more valid measurement of the
   environmental soundness of public purchasing. The statistical analyses
   were done using logit models with country, year and product group as the
   explanatory factors. It proved to be relevant to take into account the
   variation that occurred from the random existence of product groups in
   the samples of calls for tender. There were less environmental criteria
   in the calls for tenders in Finland than in Denmark and Sweden in 2003,
   but in 2005 no significant difference between Finland and Denmark was
   observed. Both Finland and Sweden saw progress in this area between 2003

Abstract = {{How can we determine differential taxa in a vegetation data set?
   The new algorithm presented here uses an intuitive fidelity threshold

   taxa.
   The new algorithm defines each taxon in each group of relevEs as: (1)

   (3) negatively differentiating, or (4) non-differentiating. Each taxon
   in a data set may be: (1) positively, positively-negatively or

   differentiating for some groups and non-differentiating for the
   remaining groups, or (3) non-differentiating for all groups in the data

   The new algorithm finds the relevE groups that are positively
   differentiated against other groups that are negatively differentiated.
   It reveals differentiating structures in the data set and thus makes
   quantification of the relations among and between different syntaxonomic

Abstract = {{In the past decade, numerous indicators and indicator sets for
   sustainable agriculture and sustainable land management have been
   proposed. In addition to their interest in comparing different
   management systems on an indicator by indicator basis, land managers are
   often interested in comparing individual indicators against a threshold,
   or, in order to study trade-offs, against each other. To this end it is
   necessary to (1) transform the original indicators into a comparable
   format, and (2) score these transformed indicators against a
   sustainability function.
   This paper introduces an evaluation method for land-use-related impact
   indicators, which was designed to accomplish these tasks. it is the
   second of a series of two papers, and as such it links into a larger
   framework for sustainability assessment of land use systems.
   The evaluation scheme introduced here comprises (1) a standardisation
   procedure, which aims at making different indicators comparable. In this
   procedure indicators are first normalised, by referencing them to the
   total impact they contribute towards, and then they are corrected by a
   factor describing the severity of this total impact in terms of
   exceeding a threshold. The procedure borrows conceptually from Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) Impact Analysis methodology; (2) a valuation
   procedure, which judges the individual standardised indicators with
   regard to sustainability.
   This methodology is then tested on an indicator set for the
   environmental impact of a spinach production system in Northwest
   Germany. The method highlights mineral resource consumption, greenhouse
   gas emission, eutrophication and impacts on soil quality as the most
   important environmental effects of the studied system.
   We then explore the effect of introducing weighting factors, reflecting
   the differing societal perception of diverse environmental issues. Two
   different sets of weighting factors are used.
   The influence of weighting is, however, small compared to that of the
   standardisation procedure introduced earlier.
   Finally, we explore the propagation of uncertainty (defined as a
   variable's 95\% confidence limits) throughout the standardisation
   procedure using a stochastic simulation approach. The uncertainty of the
   analysed standardised indicator was higher than that of the
   non-standardised indicators by a factor of 2.0 to 2.5. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Results of comprehensive geochemical mapping and thematic studies of the
   Slovak territory (rocks, soils, stream sediments, groundwaters, biomass,
   and radioactivity) in the first half of the 1990s led to several new
   research programmes in Slovakia, within the frame of which new
   methodologies for geochemical data evaluation and map visualization were
   elaborated. This study describes the application and elaboration of data
   from the Geochemical Atlas of the Slovak Republic at national and
   regional levels. Based on the index of environmental risk (I(ER) = I PEC
   pound/PNEC), the level of contamination for the geological component of
   the environment in Slovakia was evaluated. Approximately 10.5\% of
   Slovakia's territory was characterized as being environmentally
   disturbed to highly disturbed. In the areas where environmental loadings
   have accumulated, 14 regions where environmental risks existed due to
   high element concentrations were defined. The model calculations of
   health risk estimates based on the databases of the Geochemical Atlas
   for groundwater and soils indicate that the possible risk occurrence of
   carcinogenic diseases from groundwater arsenic contents is high in more
   than 10\% of Slovakia, whereas the chronic risk is negligible. To
   determinate the background and threshold levels a combined
   statistical-geochemical approach was developed and applied as an example
   for groundwater at the national level as well as for single groundwater
   bodies. The results of statistical method application for the whole
   groundwater body (GBW) were compared with the background values for
   anthropogenically non-influenced areas in GBW. Final background value
   took into account time variations and spatial distribution of the
   element in GBW. Furthermore, based on the database from the Geochemical
   Atlas for groundwater, groundwater bodies potentially at qualitative
   risk were delineated for the whole of Slovakia. From a total of 101
   groundwater bodies 17 were characterized as being at risk and 22 as
   being at possible risk.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a graph-theoretical modelling approach using daily

   habitat areas and 4) the effects of barriers and stepping stones. The
   modelling approach is tested using empirical data from field surveys in
   the urban area of Stockholm, Sweden.
   The results show that groups of small habitat patches can house the same
   species as larger contiguous patches as long as they are perceived as
   functionally connected by the inhabitant organisms. Furthermore, we
   found that binary habitat/non-habitat representations of the landscape
   could roughly explain the variation in species occurrence, as long as
   habitat was properly defined. However, the explanatory power of the
   landscape models increased when features of matrix heterogeneity such as
   stepping stones and barriers were accounted for.
   Synthesis and application: in a world where forest ecosystems are
   becoming increasingly fragmented there is an urgent need to find
   comprehensive and scientifically relevant methods for managing and
   planning ecosystems. This study shows that: 1) groups of well placed
   small habitat patches can, together, be sufficient to attract birds in
   intensively developed areas, 2) the presented modelling approach can
   help identify such groups of patches, 3) matrix heterogeneity should
   preferably be accounted for, and 4) proper assessments of habitable land

Abstract = {{Dispersal can limit the ranges of species and the diversity of

   plankton. Poor dispersers are expected to show more clumped
   distributions or greater spatial autocorrelation (SA) in community
   composition than good dispersers. We examined patterns of SA across
   freshwater taxa with different dispersal modes (active vs. passive) and
   their association with habitat type (lake vs. stream) using 18 spatially
   explicit community composition data sets. We found significant
   relationships between SA and body size among taxa in lake habitats, but
   not in streams. However, the increase in SA with body size in lakes was
   driven entirely by fishes-organisms ranging in size from diatoms to
   macro-invertebrates showed equivalent levels of SA. These results
   support the idea that large organisms are less effective dispersers in
   aquatic environments, resulting in greater SA in community structure
   over broad scales. Streams may be effectively more connected than lakes
   as patterns of SA and body size were weaker in lotic habitats. Our data

   The detection of a significant SIE is assessed through the application
   of all three methods available in the literature. Species are divided
   into generalists and specialists. We tested if the minimum area and the
   area range of each species' occurrences differ between generalists and

   specialists to generalists above and below the SIE threshold, and tested
   their cumulative ratios when islands are arranged according to
   increasing area, altitude or habitat diversity in order to identify the
   threshold where they become statistically indistinguishable from the
   ratio of the total set of islands.
   Our results indicate a strong effect of habitat availability on the SIE.
   Communities of islands within the SIE range, host a higher percentage of
   generalists. An analysis of the specific habitat requirements shows
   that, for isopods, the crucial factor is the lack of habitats related to
   inland waters from small islands.
   The distribution of habitats on islands of different size is of major
   importance for the occurrence of a SIE. The relative representation of
   specialist and generalist species on islands of different size plays an
   important role in shaping SIE-related patterns. Conservation efforts
   should pay special attention on freshwater habitats, especially on small

Abstract = {{Monitoring forest cover change and understanding the dynamics of forest
   is increasingly important in sustainable management of forest
   ecosystems. This paper uses temporal MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field
   (MODIS 44B-VCF) to monitor tree cover change over Indian region for a
   period of 6 years (2000 - 2005). Pixel based linear regression model is
   used to identify changes in the form of slope, offset and variance.
   These inputs were stacked and classified using threshold method into
   forest and non-forest classes, Which resulted in pixel change as
   no-change and the change areas as positive and negative respectively.
   MODIS-VCF raw product of 2005 was validated using field data gathered in
   different tree crown cover as part of Department of Space Department of
   Biotechnology (DOS-DBT) Biodiversity characterization at landscape level
   project and the results shows a reasonable relationship (86.6\%) between
   tree canopy cover with tree crown cover. The change pixels were masked
   with GLCF land-cover map to estimate percent tree cover change within
   the forest region for further assessment. Results were overlaid with
   UNEP protected area boundary for the application of natural resource
   management and wildlife protection. On a long-term basis, the forest
   cover change was monitored using high spatial resolution (Landsat and
   IRS LISS-III) satellite data (1972 - 2005) to identify rates of
   deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level for sustaining the
   region's biodiversity and managing the forest ecosystems. The current
   study proposes Rapid Ecological Alerts (RET's) using the forest area
   change and this approach can be automated for every year.}},

Abstract = {{Transfer of antibiotic resistance genes among gram negative bacteria in
   sewage and lake water and easy access of these bacteria to the community
   are major environmental and public health concern, The aim of this study
   was to determine transfer of the antimicrobial resistance genes from
   resistant to susceptible gram negative bacteria in the sewage and lake
   water by conjugation process and to determine the influence of some
   physico-chemical parameters of sewage and lake water on the transfer of
   these resistance genes. For this reason, we isolated 20 liter of each
   sewage and lake water from coconut area within university campus and
   Lingambudi lake respectively in Mysore city, India, during monsoon
   season and studied different physical parameters of the water samples
   like pH, temperature, conductivity, turbidity and color as well as
   chemical parameters like BOD, COD, field DO and total chloride ion. The
   gram negative bacteria were isolated and identified from the above water
   samples using microbiological and biochemical methods and their
   sensitivity to different antibiotics was determined by disc diffusion
   break point assay. Conjugation between two multiple antibiotic resistant
   isolates Pseudomonas aeuginosa and E. coli as donor and E. coli Rif'
   (sensitive to antibiotics) as recipient were carded out in 5ml sterile
   sewage and lake water All isolates were resistant to Am, moderately
   resistant to Te and E, while majority were sensitive to Cip, Gm and CAZ
   antibiotics. Horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes by
   conjugation process revealed transfer of Gm, Te and E resistant genes
   from Ps. aeruginosa to E.coli Rif recipient with mean frequency of +/-
   2.3 x 10(-4) in sewage and +/- 2.6 x 10(-6) in lake water respectively.
   Frequency of conjugation in sewage was two fold more as compared to lake
   water (p <= 0.05). Co-transfer study revealed simultaneous transfer of
   above resistant markers together to the recipient cells, As the above
   results indicate, due to selective pressure in sewage (presence of
   antibiotics), the isolates from sewage were more resistant to different
   antibiotics as compared to those from lake water Furthermore, these
   resistance genes can transfer to sensitive bacteria by conjugation.
   Physico-chemical parameters of water may play role in this process.}},

Abstract = {{An important step in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive
   is to define and characterize the natural status, designated as the
   reference condition (RC). Here we present the results of a type-specific
   screening for reference stream sites in Denmark using two different
   approaches. First, we performed a screening applying physicochemical,
   hydro-morphological and pressure criteria at the catchment, reach and
   site level of a total of 128 sites a priori selected by the regional
   water authorities as representing the best sites in Denmark. Second, we
   performed a GIS screening of all mapped streams in Denmark (26,000 km
   representing app. 90\% of all Danish streams) using solely land use
   characteristics in the catchment area to target the search for larger
   stream sites to comply with the WFD requirements of type-specificity.
   Among the 128 sites we did not find any that fulfilled all criteria
   applied at the catchment, reach and site level using recommended RC
   threshold values and only three sites using threshold values that were
   less strict. Similarly very few km (<1\%) of the GIS screened streams
   fulfilled catchment land use criteria, suggesting that the potential of
   identifying RC sites in Denmark is very limited. The lack of success in
   the screening process clearly demonstrates a need for alternative
   methods to establish RC for Danish streams. We propose a combined
   approach that includes the development of a guiding image for RC for all
   the stream biota needed to evaluate the ecological quality. This guiding
   image should be based on historical data, expert knowledge and
   investigations in streams situated in countries that are subjected to
   less intense land use and, at the same time, share both topographical
   and climatic similarities with Denmark, e. g. the Baltic countries.}},

Abstract = {{Most confined swine (Sus scrofa) feeding operations in the Southeastern
   United States hold manure in lagoons and apply effluent on bermudagrass
   {[}Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pets.] as fertilizer. Salmonella enterica
   subsp. enterica (ex Kauffman and Edwards) Le Minor and Popoff, has been
   reported in Mississippi lagoons, but levels and potential for
   contamination of bermudagrass were unknown. A laboratory method was
   developed to examine Salmonella contamination of bermudagrass and levels
   of Salmonella were determined in lagoons. The U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA) worst case water was used to simulate effluent
   in exposing bermudagrass to Salmonella. Exposed leaves were washed and
   bacteria enumerated. Contamination of leaves exposed to 10(6) cfu mL(-1)
   varied from 0 to 10(4) cfu per leaf within and among eight bermudagrass
   cultivars and five Salmonella isolates. No differences (P < 0.05)
   occurred between cultivars (n = 20) or isolates (n = 10). Data fitted
   (R-2 = 0.93) to a contamination equation (y = 5 x 10(-6)x(6.623))
   described the relationship between levels (Log(10) cfu mL(-1)) of
   exposure (x) and contamination (y). In fall 2007 Salmonella levels from
   six lagoons ranged from 1.9 to 2.8 log(10) MPN 100 mL(-1) and were below
   the threshold for contamination predicted by the equation. These
   preliminary results must be tested with effluents in the field, but
   considered alongside work of others, which report lagoon Salmonella
   levels to be highest in fall, suggest that Salmonella levels in
   effluents from these lagoons may be too low to produce measurable
   contamination on bermudagrass.}},

Abstract = {{Few data on in-barn and downwind concentrations of endotoxin,
   bioaerosols, and odors from livestock facilities are available, and no
   studies have compared conventional confinement operations with the more
   animal-friendly hoop operations. Hoops are open to the environment and
   use a composted bedding system rather than housing pigs on slatted
   floors over pits holding manure slurry as in conventional confinements.
   We assessed airborne toxicants upwind, in barns, and downwind and
   evaluated determinants of exposure. Inhalable particulate matter,
   endotoxin, odor threshold, hydrogen sulfide, culturable mesophilic
   bacteria, culturable fungi, and total airborne microbes, along with wind
   speed, temperature, and humidity were measured at separate midsized
   livestock facilities (one hoop, one confinement) in Central Iowa on 10
   occasions over 2 years. Significant differences in contaminants were
   observed between hoops and confinement buildings and across seasons for
   endotoxin, odors, airborne microorganisms, and hydrogen sulfide. For
   hoops and confinements, respectively, geometric mean in-barn
   concentrations were 3250 and 3100 EU/m(3) for endotoxin; 1400 and 1910
   mu g/m(3) for particulates; 19.6 and 146 ppb for hydrogen sulfide; 137
   and 428 dilutions for odor threshold; and 3.0 x 10(6) and 1.5 x 10(6)
   organisms/m(3) for total microbes. Endotoxin, odor, and culturable
   microorganisms exceeded recommended exposure limits. Reduced analysis of
   variance models for these contaminants demonstrated differences by barn
   type, season, number of pigs, and, in some cases, temperature and
   humidity. Both types of swine operations produced high airborne
   concentrations of endotoxin, odor, hydrogen sulfide, bacteria, and
   fungi. Endotoxin and odors were found downwind at concentrations
   previously associated with adverse health effects.}},

Abstract = {{Biological effects techniques have been used with the aim to further
   integrate biological effects measurements with chemical analysis and
   apply these methods to provide an assessment of mussel health status.
   Live native mussels were collected from selected coastal and estuarine
   sites around the British Isles, including the rivers Test, Thames, Tees,
   and Clyde, and Lunderston Bay. A suite of biological effects techniques
   was undertaken on these mussels, including whole organism responses
   (scope for growth), tissue responses (histopathology), and subcellular
   responses (lysosomal stability, multi-xenobiotic resistance {[}MXR], and
   Comet assay). In addition, whole mussel homogenates were used to measure
   organic (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons {[}PAH], polychlorinated
   biphenyls {[}PCB]) and metal concentrations. Overall the mussels
   collected from the Thames were in relatively poor health, based on
   histopathological markers, significantly higher DNA damage, and elevated
   expression of MXR detoxifying proteins. In contrast, the mussels
   collected from the River Test were in the best health, based on
   histopathological markers, respiration rate (SFG), and low frequency of
   DNA damage. In conclusion, the biological effects techniques were able
   to distinguish between relatively contaminated and clean environments,
   with the Thames mussels in worst health. Mussel tissue chemistry data
   were not able to explain the variations in biological response. Evidence
   indicates that the difference in the health of the mussels between the
   different sites was due to either effects of contaminants that were not
   measured, or the combined effects of mixture toxicity resulting in a
   threshold effect.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{585-598}},
Abstract = {{The threshold of toxicologic concern (TTC) concept was developed as a
   method to identify a chemical intake level that is predicted to be
   without adverse human health effects assuming daily intake over the
   course of a 70-yr life span. The TTC values are based on known
   structure-activity relationships and do not require chemical-specific
   toxicity data. This allows safety assessment (or prioritization for
   testing) of chemicals with known molecular structure but little or no
   toxicity data. Recently, the TTC concept was extended to inhaled
   substances by converting a TTC expressed in micrograms per person per
   day to an airborne concentration (ng/m3), making allowance for intake by
   routes in addition to inhalation and implicitly assuming 100\%
   bioavailability of inhaled toxicants. The resulting concentration of no
   toxicologic concern (CoNTC), 30 ng/m3, represents a generic airborne
   concentration that is expected to pose no hazard to humans exposed
   continuously throughout a 70-yr lifetime. Published data on the levels
   of mycotoxins in agricultural dusts or in fungal spores, along with
   measured levels of airborne mycotoxins, spores, or dust in various
   environments, were used to identify conditions under which mycotoxin
   exposures might reach the CoNTC. Data demonstrate that airborne
   concentrations of dusts and mold spores sometimes encountered in
   agricultural environments have the potential to produce mycotoxin
   concentrations greater than the CoNTC. On the other hand, these data
   suggest that common exposures to mycotoxins from airborne molds in daily
   life, including in the built indoor environment, are below the
   concentration of no toxicologic concern.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying human cancer risk arising from exposure to contaminated
   groundwater is complicated by the many hydrogeological, environmental,
   and toxicological uncertainties involved. In this study, we used Monte
   Carlo simulation to estimate cancer risk associated with
   tetrachloroethene (PCE) dissolved in groundwater by linking three
   separate models for: (1) reactive contaminant transport; (2) human
   exposure pathways; and (3) the PCE cancer potency factor. The
   hydrogeologic model incorporates an analytical solution for a
   one-dimensional advective-dispersive-reactive transport equation to
   determine the PCE concentration in a water supply well located at a
   fixed distance from a continuous source. The pathway model incorporates
   PCE exposure through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. The
   toxicological model combines epidemiological data from eight rodent
   bioassays of PCE exposure in the form of a composite cumulative
   distribution frequency curve for the human PCE cancer potency factor. We
   assessed the relative importance of individual model variables through
   their correlation with expected cancer risk calculated in an ensemble of
   Monte Carlo simulations with 20,000 trials. For the scenarios evaluated,
   three factors were most highly correlated with cancer risk: (1) the
   microbiological decay constant for PCE in groundwater, (2) the linear
   groundwater pore velocity, and (3) the cancer potency factor. We then
   extended our analysis beyond conventional expected value risk assessment
   using the partitioned multiobjective risk method (PMRM) to generate
   expected-value functions conditional to a 1 in 100,000 increased cancer
   risk threshold. This approach accounts for low probability/high impact
   outcomes separately from the conventional unconditional expected values.
   Thus, information on potential worst-case outcomes can be quantified for
   decision makers. Using PMRM, we evaluated the cost-benefit relationship
   of implementing several postulated risk management alternatives intended
   to mitigate the expected and conditional cancer risk. Our results
   emphasize the importance of hydrogeologic models in risk assessment, but
   also illustrate the importance of integrating environmental and
   toxicological uncertainty. When coupled with the PMRM, models
   integrating uncertainty in transport, exposure, and potency constitute
   an effective risk assessment tool for use within a risk-based corrective
   action (RBCA) framework.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Few population studies have reported on the long-term
   changes in the internal cadmium dose and simultaneously occurring
   mortality.
   OBJECTIVE: We monitored blood cadmium (BCd), 24-hr urinary cadmium
   (UCd), and mortality in an environmentally exposed population.
   METHODS: Starting from 1985, we followed BCd (until 2003), UCd (until
   1996), and mortality (until 2007) among 476 and 480 subjects, randomly
   recruited from low- exposure areas (LEA) and high-exposure areas (HEA).
   The last cadmium-producing plant in the HEA closed in 2002.
   RESULTS: From 1985-1989 to 1991-1996, BCd decreased by 40.3\% and 18.9\%
   in the LEA and HEA, respectively (p < 0.0001 for between-area
   difference). From 1991-1996 until 2001-2003, BCd remained unchanged in
   the HEA (+ 1.8\%) and increased by 19.7\% in the LEA (p < 0.0001). Over
   the entire follow-up period, the annual decrease in BCd averaged 2.7\%
   in the LEA (n = 258) and 1.8\% in the HEA (n = 203). From 1985-1989 to
   1991-1996, UCd fell by 12.9\% in the LEA and by 16.6\% in the HEA (p =
   0.22), with mean annual decreases of 2.7\% (n = 366) and 3.4\% (n =
   364). Over 20.3 years (median), 206 deaths (21.5\%) occurred. At
   baseline, BCd (14.6 vs. 10.2 nmol/L) and UCd (14.1 vs. 8.6 nmol/24-hr)
   were higher in deaths than in survivors. The risks (p <= 0.04)
   associated with a doubling of baseline UCd were 20\% and 44\% for total
   and noncardiovascular mortality, and 25\% and 33\% for a doubling of
   BCd.
   CONCLUSIONS: Even if zinc-cadmium smelters close, historical
   environmental contamination remains a persistent source of exposure.
   Environmental exposure to cadmium increases total and noncardiovascular
   mortality in a continuous fashion without threshold.}},

Title = {{Assessing species diagnostic value in large data sets: A comparison

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{779-U10}},

Abstract = {{Question: Diagnostic species are useful tools for the identification and
   ecological interpretation of community types. Vegetation databases
   facilitate the computation of diagnostic values of regional validity,
   but it is essential to understand the behaviour of fidelity measures in
   large data sets.
   Methods: We focused our study on the phi-coefficient (Phi) of
   association and its limit value, the Ochiai index. The northeast Spanish
   releve database was stratified using an arbitrary distance threshold in
   species composition. Diagnostic species analysis was undertaken using
   three methods of context selection: I. within a syntaxon of higher rank;
   II. including releves with similar composition to that of the target
   unit; III. using the entire stratified database. Species diagnostic
   values were computed as well as bootstrap percentile confidence
   intervals.
   Results: Many species deemed as diagnostic by method I have their optima
   in vegetation types neighbouring the unit chosen as context. In
   contrast, method II excluded many of these species. Phi-values and
   confidence intervals were similar to those obtained by the Ochiai index
   when using a large dataset (method III) but this similarity was greater
   for low level syntaxa.
   Conclusions: The diagnostic value of species in a given region is best
   assessed using the Ochiai index, since it can be split into two
   interpretable asymmetrical components. We recommend the determination of
   context-dependent differential species using the Phi-coefficient, and
   the assessment of species regional diagnostic value by means of a
   stratification procedure in combination with the Ochiai index.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Developmental exposures to organophosphate pesticides are
   virtually ubiquitous. These agents are neurotoxicants, but recent
   evidence also points to lasting effects on metabolism.
   OBJECTIVES: We administered parathion to neonatal rats. In adulthood, we
   assessed the impact on weight gain, food consumption, and glucose and
   lipid homeostasis, as well as the interaction with the effects of a
   high-fat diet.
   METHODS: Neonatal rats were given parathion on postnatal days 1-4 using
   doses (0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg/day) that straddle the threshold for barely
   detectable cholinesterase inhibition and the first signs of systemic
   toxicity. In adulthood, animals were either maintained on standard lab
   chow or switched to a high-fat diet for 7 weeks.
   RESULTS: In male rats on a normal diet, the low-dose parathion exposure
   caused increased weight gain but also evoked signs of a prediabetic
   state, with elevated fasting serum glucose and impaired fat metabolism.
   The higher dose of parathion reversed the weight gain and caused further
   metabolic defects. Females showed greater sensitivity to metabolic
   disruption, with weight loss at either parathion dose, and greater
   imbalances in glucose and lipid metabolism. At 0.1 mg/kg/day parathion,
   females showed enhanced weight gain on the high-fat diet; This effect
   was reversed in the 0.2-mg/kg/day parathion group, and was accompanied
   by, even greater deficits in glucose and fat metabolism.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal low-dose parathion exposure disrupts glucose and
   fat homeostasis in a persistent and sex-selective manner. Early-life
   toxicant exposure to organophosphates or other environmental chemicals
   may, play a role in the increased incidence of obesity and diabetes.}},

Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{The identification of disturbance thresholds is important for many
   aspects of aquatic resource management, including the establishment of
   regulatory criteria and the identification of stream reference
   conditions. A number of quantitative or model-based approaches can be
   used to identify disturbance thresholds, including nonparametric
   deviance reduction (NDR), piecewise regression (PR), Bayesian
   changepoint (BCP), quantile piecewise constant (QPC), and quantile
   piecewise linear (QPL) approaches. These methods differ in their
   assumptions regarding the nature of the disturbance-response variable
   relationship, which can make selecting among the approaches difficult
   for those unfamiliar with the methods. We first provide an overview of
   each of the aforementioned approaches for identifying disturbance
   thresholds, including the types of data for which the approaches are
   intended. We then compare threshold estimates from each of these
   approaches to evaluate their robustness using both simulated and
   empirical datasets. We found that most of the approaches were accurate
   in estimating thresholds for datasets with drastic changes in responses
   variable at the disturbance threshold. Conversely, only the PR and QPL
   approaches performed well for datasets with conditional mean or upper
   boundary changes in response variables at the disturbance threshold. The
   most robust threshold identification approach appeared to be the QPL
   approach; this method provided relatively accurate threshold estimates
   for most of the evaluated datasets. Because accuracy of disturbance
   threshold estimates can be affected by a number of factors, we recommend
   that several steps be followed when attempting to identify disturbance
   thresholds. These steps include plotting and visually inspecting the
   disturbance-response data, hypothesizing what mechanisms likely generate
   the observed pattern in the disturbance-response data, and plotting the
   estimated threshold in relation to the disturbance-response data to
   ensure the appropriateness of the threshold estimate.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated a simple bioassessment method based on a priori river
   typology to predict benthic macroinvertebrate fauna in riffle sites of
   rivers in the absence of human influence. Our approach predicted taxon
   lists specific to four river types differing in catchment area with a
   method analogous to the site-specific RIVPACS-type models. The reference
   sites grouped in accordance with their type in NMS ordination,
   indicating that the typology efficiently accounted for natural variation
   in macroinvertebrate assemblages. Compared with a null model, typology
   greatly increased the precision of prediction and sensitivity to detect
   human impairment and strengthened the correlation of the ratio of
   observed-to-expected number of predicted taxa (O/E) with the measured
   stressor variables. The performance of the typology-based approach was
   equal to that of a RIVPACS-type predictive model that we developed.
   Exclusion of rarest taxa with low occurrence probabilities improved the
   performance of both approaches by all criteria. With an increasing
   inclusion threshold of occurrence probability, especially the predictive
   model sensitivity first increased but then decreased. Many common taxa
   with intermediate type-specific occurrence probabilities were
   consistently missing from impacted sites, a result suggesting that these
   taxa may be especially important in detecting human disturbances. We
   conclude that if a typology-based approach such as that suggested by the
   European Union's Water Framework Directive is required, the O/E ratio of
   type-specific taxa can be a useful metric for assessment of the status
   of riffle macroinvertebrate communities. Successful application of the
   approach, however, requires biologically meaningful river types with a
   sufficient pool of reference sites for each type.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen fluoride (HF) is one of the most phytotoxic air pollutants and
   even concentrations below 10 ppb may cause visible injury in sensitive
   plant species. Due to the uptake of atmospheric fluorides by the
   vegetation and the accumulation of fluorine in the food chain,
   environmental monitoring in the vicinity of large emitters has often
   been performed relying on plants as bioindicators only. However, there
   are currently no approved devices available to determine atmospheric
   levels of HF in the lower concentration range. In this paper results
   from a study are presented in which passive samplers were applied for
   more than one year to monitor ambient levels of HF at various locations
   around a large chemical factory. Generally, mean HF-levels were only
   slightly above the limit of detection and remained well below the
   environmental threshold level for this air pollutant. Although the
   results from the passive sampler study well represented the spatial
   dispersion pattern of HF, high standard deviations were observed between
   the three replicates. Reasons for the high variability were presumably
   the hygroscopicity of the adsorber material triethanolamine (TEA) and
   the water films which formed on diffusive bodies at moist weather
   leading to the wash-off of adsorbed fluorides. in conclusion, advanced
   methods for passive sampling of HF with less hydroscopic adsorbents and
   high sampling rates will have to be elaborated for the reliable
   monitoring of gaseous fluorides.}},

Abstract = {{Knowing how to control a pathogen that infects more than one host
   species is of increasing importance because the incidence of such

   infections transmitted from wildlife to humans or livestock. To
   determine which options are available to control a pathogen in these

   a set of guidelines for constructing culling strategies and suggest a

Abstract = {{Hot spots are typically locations of abundant phenomena. In ecology, hot
   spots are often detected with a spatially global threshold, where a
   value for a given observation is compared with all values in a data set.
   When spatial relationships are important, spatially local definitions -
   those that compare the value for a given observation with locations in
   the vicinity, or the neighbourhood of the observation - provide a more
   explicit consideration of space. Here we outline spatial methods for hot
   spot detection: kernel estimation and local measures of spatial
   autocorrelation. To demonstrate these approaches, hot spots are detected
   in landscape level data on the magnitude of mountain pine beetle
   infestations. Using kernel estimators, we explore how selection of the
   neighbourhood size (tau) and hot spot threshold impact hot spot
   detection. We found that as tau increases, hot spots are larger and
   fewer; as the hot spot threshold increases, hot spots become larger and
   more plentiful and hot spots will reflect coarser scale spatial
   processes. The impact of spatial neighbourhood definitions on the
   delineation of hot spots identified with local measures of spatial
   autocorrelation was also investigated. In general, the larger the
   spatial neighbourhood used for analysis, the larger the area, or greater
   the number of areas, identified as hot spots.}},

Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1514-1522}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. The assessment of the environmental hazards posed by chemical
   pollutants typically results from single-species tests that are
   extrapolated to ecosystems. The aim of the present study was to compare
   this type of extrapolation for a herbicide with the chronic effects that
   may be observed at a community level and to evaluate currently applied
   risk assessment strategies for their ability to predict chemical effects
   on complex communities.
   2. Freshwater periphyton communities, grown in indoor aquaria, were
   exposed to the pollutant diuron for 3 months. Acute toxic effects of
   diuron were detected as photosynthesis inhibition using quenching
   analysis of chla-fluorescence. Chronic effects of the herbicide were
   observed in terms of changes in biomass and algal class composition as
   well as pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT). The PICT concept
   is based on a chemical exerting selection pressure on a community and
   therefore eliminating sensitive species. As a result, the measured
   community tolerance increases.
   3. Short-term effects of diuron arise from 4-9 mu g L-1 as half-maximal
   effect concentration (EC50). It is further shown that diuron
   concentrations down to 0.08 mu g L-1 caused chronic effects in two
   independent microcosm studies. The observed threshold concentration of
   0.08 mu g L-1 still caused changes in biomass and class composition as
   well as an increased community tolerance. The determined EC50 values
   increased by a factor of 2-3 in diuron-exposed periphyton communities.
   This threshold value could not be predicted by advanced extrapolation
   methods such as species sensitivity distribution or acute-to-chronic
   effect ratios.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The chronic community-level effects of
   the pollutant diuron were not predictable from single-species tests.
   However, regulations Such as the EC Water Framework Directive or the
   EC-REACH process (Registrations, Evaluation and Authorisation of
   Chemicals) rely on this type of information. The management of chemicals
   in the environment should be based upon higher-tier assessment tools.
   Species interaction, detectable and quantifiable by the PICT
   methodology, may serve as a prognostic tool in chemical hazard
   assessment when extrapolating effects from single-species tests to
   community level.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports the development and evaluation of relevant local
   ecological criteria and indicators for participatory resource management
   of community forest. The study site, the Nong Meg-Nong Hee community
   forest, Maha Sarakham Province, is in northeastern Thailand.
   Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) was adopted as a decision-making
   tool to evaluate criteria and indicators, using coarse and fine
   screening, based on local community participation. The criteria and
   indicators set consisted of 3 principles, 7 criteria, and 41 indicators
   covering the main attributes of forest ecosystem conservation. Relevant
   data were processed in a hierarchical framework and used as a template
   for further assessment, i.e., Principle 1 (forest ecosystem structure
   and composition), Principle 2 (forest ecosystem function), and Principle
   3 (disturbance signs). The two selection phases comprised (1) the coarse
   screening based on scoring and ranking, and (2) fine screening, using a
   pair-wise comparison analysis to classify the order of relative weights
   of the indicators (importance value) and the consistency index (CI) of
   each criterion. As a result of coarse screening one criterion and 16
   indicators were eliminated from the analysis, while the remaining 3
   principles, 6 criteria, and 25 indicators were retained for fine
   screening. Most criteria showed an acceptance value of less than 10\%
   (tolerance consistency index threshold level). The final set of criteria
   and indicators, based on locally understandable ecological concepts of
   forest conservation, was ranked in order of importance under each
   criterion and applied to the study area. We conclude that these
   techniques are appropriate for selecting criteria and indicators, as
   they are relatively transparent, understandable and offer an input to
   participatory decision-making. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new way of using forward selection of explanatory
   variables in regression or canonical redundancy analysis. The classical
   forward selection method presents two problems: a highly inflated Type I
   error and an overestimation of the amount of explained variance.
   Correcting these problems will greatly improve the performance of this
   very useful method in ecological modeling. To prevent the first problem,
   we propose a two-step procedure. First, a global test using all
   explanatory variables is carried out. If, and only if, the global test
   is significant, one can proceed with forward selection. To prevent
   overestimation of the explained variance, the forward selection has to
   be carried out with two stopping criteria: (1) the usual alpha
   significance level and (2) the adjusted coefficient of multiple
   determination (R(a)(2)) calculated using all explanatory variables. When
   forward selection identifies a variable that brings one or the other
   criterion over the fixed threshold, that variable is rejected, and the
   procedure is stopped. This improved method is validated by simulations
   involving univariate and multivariate response data. An ecological
   example is presented using data from the Bryce Canyon National Park,

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{472-477}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background, aim, and scope Perfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) are
   chemicals with completely fluorinated alkyl chains. The specific
   properties of the F-C bond give PFAS a high stability and make them very
   useful in a wide range of applications. PFAS also pose a potential risk
   to the environment and humans because they have been recently
   characterized as persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. The objective
   of this work is to study the bacterial degradation of PFAS under aerobic
   and anaerobic conditions in municipal sewage sludge as a contribution
   toward understanding their environmental fate and behavior.
   Materials and methods Bacterial communities from sewage sludge were
   exposed to a mixture of PFAS under aerobic or anaerobic conditions.
   Individual PFAS concentrations were determined in the experiment media
   at different exposure times using liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry analysis after extraction with solid-phase extraction.
   Results The PFAS analyses of samples of sludge showed repeatable
   replicate results, allowing a reliable quantification of the different
   groups of PFAS analyzed. No conclusive evidence for PFAS degradation was
   observed under the experimental conditions tested in this work.
   Reduction in concentrations, however, was observed for some PFAS in
   sludge under aerobic conditions.
   Discussion The largest concentration decrease occurred for the
   fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), especially for the 8:2 FTOH, which have
   been described as biodegradable in the literature. However, this
   concentration decrease could be due to different causes: sorption to
   glass, septa, or matrix components, as well as bacterial activity.
   Therefore, it is not certain that biodegradation occurred.
   Conclusions PFAS are very recalcitrant chemicals, especially when fully
   fluorinated. Although some decreases in concentration have been observed
   for some PFAS, such as the FTOHs, there is no conclusive evidence for
   biodegradation. It can be concluded that the PFAS tested in these
   experiments are non-biodegradable under these experimental conditions.
   Recommendations Since the presence of PFAS is ubiquitous in the
   environment and they can be toxic, more research is needed in this field
   to elucidate which PFAS are susceptible to biodegradation, the
   conditions required for biodegradation, and the possible routes
   followed. A possible inhibitory effect of PFAS on bacteria, the
   threshold concentrations, and conditions of inhibition should also be
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Both human and non-human determinants have shaped Mediterranean
   forest structure over the last few millennia. The effects of recent
   human activities on forest composition, however, remain poorly
   understood. We quantified changes in forest composition during the past
   century in the mixed forests of Quercus suber (cork oak) and Q.
   canariensis (Algerian oak), and explored the effects of forest
   management and environmental (climate, topography) factors on forest
   structure at various spatial and temporal scales.
   Location Mountains north of the Strait of Gibraltar (southern Spain).
   Methods First, we quantified 20th-century changes in species composition
   from a series of inventories in nine mixed forests (c. 40,000 ha), and
   examined them in terms of the management practices and environmental
   conditions. Second, we analysed present-day Q. suber and Q. canariensis
   stand structure along environmental gradients at two spatial scales: (1)
   that of the forest landscape (c. 284 ha), combining local inventories
   and topographic variables and using a digital elevation model; and (2)
   regional (c. 87,600 km(2)), combining data from the Spanish Forest
   Inventory for the Andalusia region and estimates of climatic variables.
   Results Historical data indicate anthropogenic changes in stand
   composition, revealing a sharp increase in the density of cork oaks over
   the last century. Forest management has favoured this species (for cork
   production) at the expense of Q. canariensis. The impact of management
   is imprinted on the present-day forest structure. The abundance of both
   species increases with annual mean precipitation, and they coexist above
   800 mm (the minimum threshold for Q. canariensis). Quercus suber
   dominates in most of the stands, and species segregation in the
   landscape is associated with the drainage network, Q. canariensis being
   clearly associated with moister habitats near streams.
   Main conclusions Our study quantitatively exemplifies a recent
   human-mediated shift in forest composition. As a result of forest
   management, the realized niche of the cork oak has been enlarged at the
   expense of that of Q. canariensis, providing further evidence for humans
   as major drivers of oak forest composition across the Mediterranean.
   Recent regeneration problems detected in Q. suber stands, a reduced
   demand for wood products, conservation policies, and climate change
   augur new large-scale shifts in forest composition.}},

Abstract = {{Soil salinity is the one of the most important abiotic factors
   influencing the growth, development and yields of crops. However, it is
   difficult to deter-mine exact concentrations of salt which cause soil
   salinity. Salinity threshold levels depend on a crop species, variety,
   developmental stage and environmental factors. This paper presents the
   results of an experiment on the effect of different soil concentrations
   of NaCl soil on several oxidation stress parameters, such as catalase
   and peoxidase activity, content of ascorbic acid, phenols and flavonoids
   in bean plants.
   A laboratory pot experiment was carried out on samples of light silty
   loam containing 1.2\% of humus. Pots were filled with 1 kg soil samples
   each, to which NaCl solution was added in doses 10, 30 and 50 mM kg(-1).
   Each pot was seeded with 7 seeds of cv. Aura bean. The plants grown in
   soil without NaCl were the control. On days 14, 21 and 28 green parts of
   plants were collected for determinations of catalase and peroxidase
   activity by colorometry as well as the content and flavonoids, phenols,
   ascorbic acid and chloride concentration by Mohr's method.
   The results show that chloride concentration in bean plants increased at
   higher of NaCl concentration in soil. Tire activity of the antyoxidative
   enzymes such as catalase and peroxidase in bean plants, on sampling
   days, was higher as the chloride concentration in plants increased.
   Non-enzymatic antioxidants: flavonoids, phenols and ascorbic acid
   content during the experiment showed different changes with relation to
   the chloride content, but in all the trials ascorbic acid content was
   significantly positively correlated whereas the content of phenols was
   significantly negatively correlated with the chloride content in plant
   tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge on below-ground plant distributions is almost lacking to date,
   despite the fact that such information would be very valuable in
   understanding below-ground competition and species-specific
   interactions, processes that are expected to shape community structure.
   Methods available so far for below-ground species determination have
   drawbacks that we tried to challenge. Some methods make use of
   differences in the chemical composition between species, but this is
   highly variable upon environmental factors. DNA-based techniques - far
   less dependent on chemical composition - such as polymerase chain
   reaction on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers can so far only
   determine presence-absence of a species in a mixed root sample. Here, we
   present a quantitative DNA-based technique that allows investigation of
   relative species abundances in experimental mixed root samples. We used
   quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on
   species-specific markers obtained from intersimple sequence repeat
   (ISSR) analyses in root samples. This molecular technique is novel in
   the field of root ecology and its development overcame three challenges:
   (i) determination of species-specific DNA fragments, (ii) development
   and optimization of the real time PCR protocol, (iii) designing a data
   treatment method based on a modified delta-delta-cycle threshold (CT)
   analysis. The method gained robustness from using relative DNA
   abundances in species mixtures rather than absolute concentration
   readings. This requires accurate multispecies reference series as a
   calibration. Test samples with different known biomass ratios of all
   species showed proof of concept of this method. The pro's and contra's
   of this method are discussed in the light of its contribution to
   advancing ecological research on below-ground plant-plant interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The EU Water Framework and Groundwater directives stipulate that EU
   member states have to assess groundwater chemical status by the use of
   groundwater threshold values derived for the protection of dependent
   ecosystems and human health. This paper presents a synthesis of main
   results of 14 European case studies evaluating a methodology for
   derivation of natural background levels (NBLs) and groundwater threshold
   values (TVs) proposed by the EU research project ``BRIDGE{''}. The 14
   investigated groundwater bodies were selected to represent as many
   aquifer types, climate settings and European ecoregions as possible
   within the project group that included partners from 17 EU countries.
   The selected case study sites include transboundary groundwater bodies,
   EU Pilot River Basins and other important groundwater systems. Some are
   known to interact with associated ecosystems, while others do not. The
   proposed method derives groundwater threshold values based on
   environmental objectives for dependent ecosystems or groundwater
   ``itself{''} using relevant reference criteria such as natural
   background levels, environmental quality standards and drinking water
   standards. Derived groundwater threshold values for dissolved Cl and As
   applying drinking water standards as examples of reference values, are
   compared for all 14 case studies. Additionally, more detailed analyses
   are conducted for the Odense Pilot River Basin and the Vouga River
   Basin, where groundwater threshold values for N and P and Cl, As, Cd,
   Ni, Pb, and Zn, respectively, are derived based on environmental
   objectives and quality standards for groundwater dependent ecosystems.
   Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is operational and may
   be used to protect human health and the environment. Further they show
   that groundwater threshold values derived from environmental objectives
   and environmental quality standards for dependent ecosystems in some
   cases may be significantly lower than drinking water standards, e.g. for
   nitrate. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The slope and aspect of a vegetated surface strongly affects the amount
   of solar radiation intercepted by that surface. Solar radiation is the
   dominant component of the surface energy balance and influences
   ecologically critical factors of microclimate, including near-surface
   temperatures, evaporative demand and soil moisture content. It also
   determines the exposure of vegetation to photosynthetically active and
   ultra-violet wavelengths. Spatial variation in slope and aspect is
   therefore a key determinant of vegetation pattern, species distribution
   and ecosystem processes in many environments. Slope and aspect angle may
   vary considerably over distances of a few metres, and fine-scale
   species' distribution patterns frequently follow these topographic
   patterns. The availability of suitable microclimate at such scales may
   be critical for the response of species distributions to climatic change
   at much larger spatial scales. However, quantifying the relevant
   microclimatic gradients is not straightforward, as the potential
   variation in solar radiation flux under clear-sky conditions is modified
   by local and regional variations in cloud cover, and interacts with
   long-wave radiation exchange, local meteorology and surface
   characteristics.
   We tested simple models of near-surface temperature and potential
   evapotranspiration driven by meteorological data with the incoming solar
   radiation flux adjusted for topography against measurements of
   temperature and soil moisture at two chalk grassland field sites in
   contrasting regional climates of the United Kingdom. We then estimated
   the cumulative distribution function of three key ecological variables
   (monthly temperature sums above 5 and 30 degrees C, plus potential
   evapotranspiration) across areas of complex topography at each site
   using two separate approaches: a spatially explicit and a spatially
   implicit method. The spatially explicit method uses digital elevation
   models of the sites to calculate the solar radiation at each grid cell
   and hence determines the spatial distribution of environmental
   variables. The second, less computationally intensive, method uses
   estimated statistical distributions of slope and aspect within the field
   sites to calculate the proportion of the surface area of each site
   predicted to exceed a given threshold of temperature sum or potential
   evapotranspiration. The spatially implicit model reproduces the range of
   the explicit model reasonably well but is limited by the
   parameterisation of slope and aspect, underlining the importance of
   variation in topography in determining the microclimatic conditions of a
   site. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Salt-affected soils are a major threat to agriculture especially in the
   semiarid regions of the world. The effective management of these soils
   requires adequate understanding of not only how water and, hence,
   solutes are transported within the soil, but also how soil salinity and
   sodicity spatially interact to determine soil structural breakdown. For
   sustainable agricultural production, information on quantitative soil
   quality, such as salinity, is required for effective land management and
   environmental planning. In this study, quantitative methods for mapping
   indicators of soil structural stability, namely salinity and sodicity,
   were developed to assess the effect of these primary indicators on soil
   structural breakdown. The current levels of soil salinity, as measured
   by electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil/water suspension, soil
   sodicity, represented by exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), and
   aggregate stability, were assessed. Remote sensing, geographical
   information system (GIS), and geostatistical techniques-primarily
   regression-kriging and indicator-kriging-were used to spatially predict
   the soil sodicity and salinity. The patterns of salinity (EC) and
   sodicity (ESP > 5\%) were identified. The effect of land use on these
   soil quality indicators was found to be minimal. Co-spatial patterns
   were elucidated between sodic soils (defined by ESP > 5\%) and highly
   probable mechanically dispersive soils predicted from indicator-kriging
   of ASWAT scores. It was established that the incorporation of EC with
   ESP into an objective index, called electrolyte stability index (ESI =
   ESP/EC), gave a good indication of soil dispersion, although the
   threshold ESI value below which effective structural breakdown might
   occur is 0.025, which is twice as small as the expected 0.05. The
   discrepancies between ESI and ASWAT scores suggest that other soil
   factors than salinity and sodicity are affecting soil structural
   breakdown. This calls for further investigation. The study provides
   valuable information in the form of risk zones of soil structural
   breakdown for land management. These zones, with a probability of
   mechanical soil dispersion of > 0.70, require immediate management
   attention with greater monitoring and amelioration techniques,
   particularly gypsum or lime application and/or altered cultivation
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The goals of environmental legislation and associated regulations are to
   protect public health, natural resources, and ecosystems. In this
   context, monitoring programs should provide timely and relevant
   information so that the regulatory community can implement legislation
   in a cost-effective and efficient manner. The Safe Drinking Water Act
   (SDWA) of 1974 attempts to ensure that public water systems (PWSs)
   supply safe water to its consumers. As is the case with many other
   federal environmental statutes, SDWA monitoring has been implemented in
   relatively uniform fashion across the USA. In this three part series, we
   present over 30 years of evidence to demonstrate unique patterns in
   water quality contaminants over space and time, develop alternative
   place-based monitoring approaches that exploit such patterns, and
   evaluate the economic performance of such approaches to current
   monitoring practice. Part III: Place-based (PBA) and current SDWA
   monitoring approaches were implemented on test datasets (1995-2001) from
   19 water systems and evaluated based on the following criteria: percent
   of total detections, percent detections above threshold values (e.g. 20,
   50, 90\% of MCL), and cost. The PBA outperformed the current SDWA
   monitoring requirements in terms of total detections, missed only a
   small proportion of detections below the MCL, and captured all
   detections above 50\% of the MCL. Essentially the same information
   obtained from current compliance monitoring requirements can be gained
   at approximately one-eighth the cost by implementing the PBA. Temporal
   sampling strategies were implemented on test datasets (1995-2001) from
   four water systems and evaluated by the following criteria: parameter
   estimation, percent deviation from ``true{''} 90th, 95th, and 99th
   percentiles, and number of samples versus accuracy of the estimate. Non
   event-based (NEB) strategies were superior in estimating percentiles
   1-50, but underestimated the higher percentiles. Event-based strategies
   were superior in estimating 95th and 99th percentiles, and required
   significantly fewer samples (than NEB strategies) to estimate the
   ``true{''} 95th and 99th percentiles. Incorporation of place-based
   information significantly improves the performance of monitoring and
   temporal sampling strategies in the context of surface-influenced water
   systems in the state of Iowa. Application of similar methods to other
   areas and types of water systems would likely produce similar results.
   Compared to current SDWA monitoring, the place based approach allows for
   cost-effective, enhanced characterization of local contaminants of
   concern.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Species optima or indicator values are frequently used to
   predict environmental variables from species composition. The present
   study focuses on the question whether predictions can be improved by
   using species environmental amplitudes instead of single values
   representing species optima.
   Location: Semi- natural, deciduous hardwood forests of northwestern
   Germany.
   Methods: Based on a data set of 558 releves, species responses (
   presence/absence) to pH were modelled with Huisman-OlffFresco (HOF)
   regression models. Species amplitudes were derived from response curves
   using three different methods. To predict the pH from vegetation, a
   maximum amplitude overlap method was applied. For comparison,
   predictions resulting from several established methods, i. e. maximum
   likelihood/ present and absent species, maximum likelihood/ present
   species only, mean weighted averages and mean Ellenberg indicator values
   were calculated. The predictive success ( squared Pearson's r and root
   mean square error of prediction) was evaluated using an independent data
   set of 151 releves.
   Results: Predictions based upon amplitudes defined by maximum Cohen's
   chi probability threshold yield the best results of all amplitude
   definitions ( R(2) = 0.75, RMSEP = 0.52). Provided there is an even
   distribution of the environmental variable, amplitudes defined by
   predicted probability exceeding prevalence are also suitable (R(2) =
   0.76, RMSEP = 0.55). The prediction success is comparable to maximum
   likelihood ( present species only) and - after rescaling - to mean
   weighted averages. Predicted values show a good linearity to observed pH
   values as opposed to a curvilinear relationship of mean Ellenberg
   indicator values. Transformation or rescaling of the predicted values is
   not required.
   Conclusions: Species amplitudes given by a minimum and maximum boundary
   for each species can be used to efficiently predict environmental
   variables from species composition. The predictive success is superior
   to mean Ellenberg indicator values and comparable to mean indicator
   values based on species weighted averages.}},

Abstract = {{Estuarine sediment contamination is a growing significant ecological
   issue in New Zealand. Methods of assessing toxicity and ecological
   impacts in a cost effective way are currently limited. Further to that
   is a need to develop bioassays that generate data quickly and cost
   effectively and have ecological relevance to the wider community. A
   chronic full life-cycle bioassay to assess the toxicity of New Zealand
   estuarine sediments using the marine harpacticoid copepod Robertsonia
   propinqua has been investigated. Sediment samples were collected from
   the Bay of Plenty region and included two polluted and one reference
   site. Sources of pollutants in the contaminated field sites originated
   from a variety of sources and generally include nutrients, pesticides
   and herbicides and the pollutants zinc, copper, lead and polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Conversely, the reference site was exposed
   to low levels of contaminants due to the relatively undeveloped
   catchment. Adult male and female copepods were exposed to field
   collected sediments for 24 days under flow-through conditions at 21
   degrees C and 12 h L:D cycles. Five endpoints were recorded: male and
   female survival, fecundity (number of gravid females per replicate at
   the end of the test), clutch size per female, number of eggs per sample
   and juvenile survival (number of nauplii and copepodites per replicate
   at the end of the test). Adult mortality was observed in all sediment
   samples but the number of males, gravid females, clutch size per female
   and number of eggs produced were not affected by either the contaminated
   or reference sediment samples. However, the contaminated sediments did
   reduce reproductive output (i.e. nauplii and copepodite production).
   Therefore, we conclude that reproductive endpoints provide a good
   measure of sediment-associated contaminant effects compared with adult
   R. propinqua survivorship. It may be that a change in focus from
   chemical thresholds without ecological relevance or lethal dose
   threshold methods, to more subtle but ecologically significant elements
   of faunal life, such as reproductive success, are a more sensitive and a
   long term ecologically informative method. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Several heavy metals have been shown to have toxic effects
   on the peripheral and central auditory system. Cadmium (Cd2+) is an
   environmental contaminant showing a variety of adverse effects. Given
   the current rate of release into the environment, the amount of Cd2+
   present in the human body and the incidence of Cd2+-related diseases are
   expected to increase.
   OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of this study was to gain, further insights
   into the mechanism of Cd2+-induced ototoxicity.
   METHODS: Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial
   membrane potential (NIMP), cytochrome c (cyt c), phosphorylated
   extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (p-ERK), caspases,
   morphologic change, and functional changes in HEI-OC1 cells, rat
   cochlear ex. plants, and mouse cochlea after Cd2+ exposure were measured
   by flow cytometry, immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis,
   and auditory brainstem response (ABR) recording. Mechanisms underlying
   Cd(2+)ototoxicity were studied using inhibitors of different signaling
   pathways, caspases, and antioxidants.
   RESULTS: Cd2+ exposure caused cell death, ROS generation, MMP loss, cyt
   c release, activation of caspases, ERK activation, apoptosis, and
   finally auditory threshold shift. Cd2+ toxicity interfered with
   inhibitors of cellular signaling pathways, such as ERK and c-jun
   N-terminal kinase, and with caspase inhibitors, especially inhibitors of
   caspase-9 and caspase-3. The antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine and
   ebselen showed a significant protective effect on the Cd2+ toxicity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cd2+ is ototoxic with a complex underlying mechanism.
   However, ROS generation may be the cause of the toxicity, and
   application of antioxidants can prevent the toxic effect.}},

Abstract = {{Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprint data are now
   commonly collected using DNA sequencers. AFLP genotypes are still often
   scored by eye from such data-a time-consuming, error-prone and
   subjective process. We present a semi-automated method of genotyping
   sequencer-collected AFLPs at predefined fragment locations (loci) within
   the fingerprint. Our method uses thresholds of AFLP-polymerase chain
   reaction-product fluorescence intensity (peak height) in order to: (i)
   exclude AFLP loci that are likely to contribute high rates of error to
   data sets, and (ii) determine the AFLP phenotype (fragment presence or
   absence) at the retained loci. Error rate analysis is an integral part
   of this process and is used to determine optimal thresholds that
   minimize genotyping error, while maximizing the numbers of retained
   loci. We show that application of this method to a large AFLP data set
   allows genotype calls that are rapid, objective and repeatable,
   facilitating the extraction of reliable genotype data for molecular
   ecological studies.}},

Abstract = {{When plant cover is measured by the pin-point method the results are
   traditionally reported by the observed mean and the variance of the
   number of hits. However, in order to model plant cover data it would be
   advantageous to have a model that describes the stochastic ecological
   processes. Here a hierarchical stochastic model of zero-inflated
   generalised binomial distributed data is introduced. The model
   specifically represents two important characteristics of the
   distribution of plant species: plant species do not occur everywhere
   possible within their realised niche and the data will consequently be
   zero-inflated, and even if a plant species do occur in the area the
   number of hits typically will be overdispersed relative to the binomial
   distribution due to a non-random distribution of individual plants. The
   stochastic model is applied using different regression models with a
   varying degree of complexity on hierarchical pin-point cover data of 155
   plant species at 10 different habitat types regressed on the measured
   carbon/nitrogen ratio. The plant cover data displayed a considerable
   amount of intra-class positive correlation with an average intra-class
   correlation of 0.31. The degree of intra-class positive correlation
   differed significantly among habitat types, and generally, it may be
   concluded that it is critical to take intra-class correlation into
   account when modelling pin-point cover data. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

   a single change-enhanced image has been used to optimize the binary

Abstract = {{Tracking land cover changes using remotely-sensed data contributes to
   evaluating to what extent human activities impact the environment.
   Recent studies have pointed out some limitations of single-date
   comparisons between years and have emphasized the usefulness of time
   series. However, less effort has hitherto been dedicated to properly
   account for the temporal dependences typifying the successive images of
   a time series. An automated change detection method based on a
   per-object approach and on a probabilistic procedure is proposed here to
   better cope with this issue. This innovative procedure is applied to a
   tropical forest environment using high temporal resolution
   SPOT-VEGETATION time series from 2001 and 2004 in the Brazilian state of
   Rondonia. The principle of the method is to identify the objects that
   most deviate from an unchanged reference defined by objective rules. A
   probabilistic changed-unchanged threshold provides a change map where
   each object is associated with a likelihood of having changed. This
   improvement on a binary diagnostic makes the method relevant to meet the
   requirements of different users, ranging from a comprehensive detection
   of changes to a detection of the most dramatic changes. According to the
   threshold value, overall accuracy indices of up to 91 \% were obtained,
   with errors involving change omissions for the most part. The isolation
   of changes within objects was made possible through a segmentation
   procedure implemented in a temporal context. In addition, the method was
   formulated so as to differentiate between inter- and intra-annual
   vegetation dynamics. These technical peculiarities will likely make this
   analytical framework suitable for detecting changes in environments
   subject to a strongly marked phenology. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study was to assess Korean farmer's exposure level to
   dust in pig buildings and dust emissions by investigating airborne
   concentrations of total and respirable dust. Five main types of pig
   buildings operating currently in Korea were selected. For area air
   sampling, 30 sites per each building type were visited during spring
   (March - May) and autumn (September - November) seasons. For personal
   air sampling, concentrations of total and respirable dust were measured
   for 2-3 hours, during cleaning the pig building before the end of the
   daily shift, by attaching air sampling equipment near to the farmer's
   breathing zone. Measurement were taken for 8 hours, e.g. average daily
   work time (09:00-17:00), at 0.5 m above the floor at three locations on
   the central alley in the pig building. Emission rates of total and
   respirable dust were estimated by multiplying the mean concentration of
   total and respirable dust measured near the air outlet by the mean
   ventilation rate, and expressed either per area or per pig of five
   weight. The ranges of farmer's exposure level to total dust and
   respirable dust in the pig buildings were estimated as 0.6-6.7 mg m(-3)
   and 0.3-3.5 mg m(-3), respectively. The pig buildings operated with a
   deep-litter bed system showed the highest dust level while the naturally
   ventilated pig buildings with slats represented the lowest dust level
   (p<0.05). Emission rates ranged from 35-400 ing h(-1) m(-2) for total
   dust and from 4-40 mg h(-1) m(-2) for respirable dust, respectively,
   indicating a similar pattern for the distribution of exposure level.
   Korean farmers' exposure level to dust in all the pig buildings
   investigated was below the exposure limit value equal in Korea equal to
   10 mg m(-3), while it exceeded the threshold unit values (TLVs)
   established in other developed Countries. In comparison with previous
   studies performed in other countries, mean exposure level in the pig
   buildings of Korea was generally lower for total dust and higher for
   respirable dust based on the area sampling method.}},

Abstract = {{Although the acid sensitivity of many invertebrate species in lakes is
   well known, methods for assessment of lake acidification based on
   macroinvertebrate samples are less developed than for rivers. This
   article analyses a number of existing metrics developed for assessment
   of river acidification, and evaluates their performance for assessment
   of lake acidification. Moreover, new species-based indicators of lake
   acidification were developed and tested. The selected dataset contains
   668 samples on littoral macroinvertebrates from 427 lakes with almost
   60\% of the samples from Sweden and the rest from UK and Norway.
   Flexible, non-parametric regression models were used for explorative
   analyses of the pressure-response relationships. The metrics have been
   assessed according to their response to pH, the degree of non-linearity
   of the response and the influence of humic compounds. Acid-sensitive
   metrics often showed a threshold in response to pH between 5.8 and 6.5.
   Highly acid-tolerant metrics were typically dominant across the whole pH
   range. Humic level had a positive effect for most acid-sensitive
   metrics. Generally, most metrics showed a more non-linear response
   pattern for the humic lakes than for clear lakes. The significant
   relationship between these macroinvertebrate metrics and acidification
   shows that there is a potential for developing further the assessment
   systems for ecological quality of lakes based on these metrics, although
   the metrics explained a low \% of the variation (< 30\%). In order to
   improve the predictive power of the biotic metrics across the acidified
   part of Europe, further harmonization and standardisation of sampling
   effort and taxa identification are needed.}},

   analyses of large pan-European datasets for phytoplankton, macrophytes,
   macroinvertebrates and fish, and indicators and relationships showing
   the impact of eutrophication or acidification on these biological
   elements were constructed. The thresholds identified in many of the
   response curves are well suited for setting ecological status class
   boundaries and can be applied in the intercalibration of classification
   systems. Good indicators for phytoplankton (chrysophytes, cyanobacteria)
   and macrophytes (isoetids and charaphytes) responses to eutrophication
   were identified, and the level of eutrophication pressure needed to
   reach the thresholds for these indicators was quantified. Several
   existing metrics developed for macrophytes had low comparability and
   need further harmonisation to be useful for intercalibration of
   classification systems. For macroinvertebrates, a number of metrics
   developed for rivers turned out to be less useful to describe lake
   responses to eutrophication and acidification, whereas other species
   based indicators were more promising. All the biological elements showed
   different responses in different lake types according to alkalinity and
   humic substances, and also partly according to depth. Better
   harmonisation of monitoring methods is needed to achieve better
   precision in the dose-response curves. Future research should include
   impacts of hydromorphological pressures and climate change, as well as

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with a novel version of the INAR(1) model, a
   non-linear auto-regressive Markov chain on N, with innovations following
   a finite mixture distribution of m >= 1 Poisson laws. For m > 1, the
   stationary marginal probability distribution of the chain is
   overdispersed relative to a Poisson, thus making INAR(1) suitable for
   modeling time series of counts with arbitrary overdispersion. The
   one-step transition probability function of the chain is also a finite
   mixture, of m Poisson-Binomial laws, facilitating likelihood-based
   inference for model parameters. An explicit EM-algorithm is devised for
   inference by maximization of a conditional likelihood. Alternative
   options for inference are discussed along with criteria for selecting
   in. Integer-valued prediction (IP) is developed by a parametric
   bootstrap approach to `coherent' forecasting, and a certain test
   statistic based on predictions is introduced for assessing performance
   of the fitted model. The proposed model is fitted to time series of
   counts of pixels where spatially averaged rain rate exceeds a given

   50 and 80\% RH due to excessive sorption of water, Heating of CMS tubes
   during sampling or dry-purging of CMS tubes post sampling effectively
   reduced water sorption with heating of tubes being preferred due to the
   higher recovery and reproducibility. Tenax tubes had breakthrough of the

   sites in Flanders showing different degrees of heavy metal contamination
   were selected for this purpose. An on-line isotope dilution method in
   combination with size exclusion (SE) high pressure liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) coupled to Inductively Coupled Plasma time-of-flight Mass
   Spectrometry (ICP-TOFMS) was used to study the cytosolic speciation of
   the metals. The distribution of the metals Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn among
   cytosolic fractions displayed strong differences. The cytosolic
   concentration of Cd, Ni and Pb increased proportionally with the total
   liver levels. However, the cytosolic concentrations of Cu and Zn only
   increased above a certain liver tissue threshold level. Cd, Cu and Zn,
   but not Pb and Ni, were largely associated with the MT pool in
   correspondence with the environmental exposure and liver tissue
   concentrations. Most of the Pb and Ni and a considerable fraction of Cu
   and Zn, but not Cd, were associated to High Molecular Weight (HMW)
   fractions. The relative importance of the Cu and Zn in the HMW fraction
   decreased with increasing contamination levels while the MT pool became
   progressively more important. The close relationship between the
   cytosolic metal load and the total MT levels or the metals bound on the
   MT pool indicates that the metals, rather than other stress factors, are
   the major factor determining MT induction. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The applicability of grain-size trend analysis for determining sediment
   transport pathways was investigated on two macrotidal shorefaces of the
   southern North Sea and Dover Strait where sediment transport is strongly
   controlled by well-defined, shore-parallel, tidal currents. Sediment
   transport directions were defined following the Gao and Collins
   (Sedimentary Geology, 80, 47-60) method, using surficial sediment
   samples collected from 0 to 8 m water depths. Grain-size trend analysis
   produced results in relatively good agreement with the directions of
   near-bottom currents measured in the vicinity of the sampling sites in
   some cases, but also yielded more confused patterns of calculated
   transport vectors in others. The best results were obtained when using
   discrete sets of samples collected during a distinct half tide-cycle.
   Comparison of threshold shear velocity for sediment motion with
   estimates of bed shear velocity obtained from near-bottom current data
   recorded simultaneously with sediment sampling indicates that sediment
   transport was most likely occurring when sediment samples were
   collected, suggesting that the grain-size trends observed in the surface
   sediments probably reflect the last transport event. Our results suggest
   that grain-size trend analysis can be efficient for determining the mean
   transport direction of the last sediment transport event when applied to
   small areas and when sampling is limited to the thickness of the active
   layer of sediment remobilisation. This method may be appropriate,
   however, for defining time-averaged residual transport directions when
   applied to larger areas over which progressive variations in surface
   sediment distribution reflect a longer term adjustment to hydraulic
   regime.}},

   The concentrations of HHCB, AHTN, AHMI and ADBI ranged from below
   detection limits to 78.6 mg/kg dry weight. HHCB and AHTN were the two
   predominant polycyclic musks in sludge samples, suggesting the extensive
   use of these two polycyclic musks in Hong Kong. Polycyclic musk levels
   in CEPT sludge were significantly higher than those in SecT and PT
   sludge, suggesting that CEPT sludge has a higher ability to retain
   polycyclic musks. Comparisons to global concentrations revealed that
   HHCB and AHTN concentrations detected in Hong Kong sludge ranked first
   and second respectively. However, the estimated levels of HHCB and AHTN
   in the discharged effluent from sewage treatment plants may pose low

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiologic studies have identified
   organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) as environmental factors potentially
   contributing to the increase in asthma prevalence over the last 25
   years. In support of this hypothesis, we have demonstrated that
   environmentally relevant concentrations of OPs induce airway
   hyperreactivity in guinea pigs.
   OBJECTIVES: Sensitization to allergen is a significant contributing
   factor in asthma, and we have shown that sensitization changes
   virus-induced airway hyperreactivity from an eosinophil-independent
   mechanism to one mediated by eosinophils. Here, we determine whether
   sensitization similarly influences OP-induced airway hyperreactivity.
   METHODS: Nonsensitized and ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs were
   injected subcutaneously with the OP parathion (0.001-1.0 mg/kg).
   Twenty-four hours later, animals were anesthetized and ventilated, and
   bronchoconstriction was measured in response to either vagal stimulation
   or intravenous acetylcholine. Inflammatory cells and
   acetylcholinesterase activity were assessed in tissues collected
   immediately after physiologic measurements.
   RESULTS: Ovalbumin sensitization decreased the threshold dose for
   parathion-induced airway hyperreactivity and exacerbated parathion
   effects on vagally induced bronchoconstriction. Pretreatment with
   antibody to interleukin (IL)-5 prevented parathion-induced
   hyperreactivity in sensitized but not in nonsensitized guinea pigs.
   Parathion did not increase the number of eosinophils in airways or the
   number of eosinophils associated with airway nerves nor did it alter
   eosinophil activation as assessed by major basic protein deposition.
   CONCLUSIONS: Antigen sensitization increases vulnerability to
   parathion-induced airway hyperreactivity and changes the mechanism to
   one that is dependent on IL-5. Because sensitization to allergens is
   characteristic of 50\% of the general population and 80\% of asthmatics
   (including children), these findings have significant implications for
   OP risk assessment, intervention, and treatment strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, known

   five reasons: (1) it ignores the predicted probability values and the
   goodness-of-fit of the model; (2) it summarises the test performance
   over regions of the ROC space in which one would rarely operate; (3) it
   weights omission and commission errors equally; (4) it does not give

Abstract = {{Aim To determine the functional relationships between, and the relative
   importance of, different driver variables (mean annual precipitation,
   soil properties, fire and herbivory) in regulating woody plant cover
   across broad environmental gradients in African savannas.
   Location Savanna grasslands of East, West and Southern Africa.
   Methods The dependence of woody cover on mean annual precipitation
   (MAP), soil properties (texture, nitrogen mineralization potential and
   total phosphorus), fire regimes, and herbivory (grazer, browser + mixed
   feeder, and elephant biomass) was determined for 161 savanna sites
   across Africa using stochastic gradient boosting, a refinement of the
   regression tree analysis technique.
   Results All variables were significant predictors of woody cover,
   collectively explaining 71\% of the variance in our data set. However,
   their relative importance as regulators of woody cover varied. MAP was
   the most important predictor, followed by fire return periods, soil
   characteristics and herbivory regimes. Woody cover showed a strong
   positive dependence on MAP between 200 and 700 mm, but no dependence on
   MAP above this threshold when the effects of other predictors were
   accounted for. Fires served to reduce woody cover below
   rainfall-determined levels. Woody cover showed a complex, non-linear
   relationship with total soil phosphorus, and was negatively correlated
   with clay content. There was a strong negative dependence of woody cover
   on soil nitrogen (N) availability, suggesting that increased
   N-deposition may cause shifts in savannas towards more grassy states.
   Elephants, mixed feeders and browsers had negative effects on woody
   cover. Grazers, on the other hand, depressed woody cover at low biomass,
   but favoured woody vegetation when their biomass exceeded a certain
   threshold.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate complex and contrasting
   relationships between woody cover, rainfall, soil properties and
   disturbance regimes in savannas, and suggest that future environmental
   changes such as altered precipitation regimes, N-enrichment and elevated
   levels of CO2 are likely to have opposing, and potentially interacting,
   influences on the tree-grass balance in savannas.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Low-flow stream chemistry and rainfall event reactions of nested
   catchments in the mesoscale Dreisam catchment in the Black Forest
   Mountains, southwest Germany, were analyzed to investigate how the
   dominant runoff generation processes change with scale. The catchment
   sizes range from a 0.015 km(2) headwater catchment to the 258 km(2)
   Dreisam catchment. Synoptic sampling during low flows was used to
   address the spatial heterogeneity of the investigated tracers. Six
   events were sampled using three different experimental designs with the
   environmental tracers dissolved silica, oxygen-18, deuterium, and
   potassium to investigate event processes at different scales. Results
   are elucidated with respect to the widely noticed Representative
   Elementary Area (REA) concept. Most of the observed differences between
   the catchments could be related to changes in the topography and other
   catchment properties (i.e., soils, geology, land use). The test site
   catchments less than 1-2 km(2) were found to be nonrepresentative of the
   runoff generation in larger catchments due to the topographic structure
   and a reduced number of hydrological response units (HRU) and,
   consequently, generated runoff components. In catchments larger than 40
   km(2) an additional runoff component, the surface runoff from urban
   areas, became increasingly important. However, surprisingly small
   differences in the tracer responses at catchments between 1 and 40 km(2)
   were observed. Although the lower threshold (1-2 km(2)) was similar for
   both methods (low-flow and event investigations), results suggest that
   the thresholds depend on the investigated scale and hydrological
   parameters as well as the catchment properties. Applying microscale
   tracer methods at the mesoscale provided detailed insights into the
   scaling of the dominant runoff processes. The results show that this
   approach is an important component when addressing the scaling behavior
   besides the numerous microscale studies and modeling approaches.
   However, quantitative interpretations are limited owing to inherent
   heterogeneity at this scale.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Does the seed density of invasive species affect establishment
   by native species in a bare ground context (following invasive species
   control efforts), and is it possible to promote transition to a native
   species dominated state by manipulating sowing density of the native
   community?
   Location: Experimental wetland basin in Chanhassen, Minnesota, USA.
   Methods: A mesocosm experiment investigated the influence of Phalaris
   arundinacea (invasive species) propagule pressure on establishment of
   native wet meadow species in the context of a newly restored wetland.
   Mesocosms were sown with P. arundinacea (0, 10, 50, 100, or 500
   seeds/m(2)) and a mix of native species (3000 or 15000 seeds/m(2)).
   Results: When planted at densities > 100 seeds/m(2), P. arundinacea
   increased suppression of native species. Also, high native seed density
   suppressed P. arundinacea biomass production. This effect was more
   pronounced when P. arundinacea seed density was high (> 100 seeds/m(2)),
   but high native seed density (15000 seeds/m(2)) did not suppress
   recruitment of P. arundinacea from seed.
   Conclusions: The transition from post-control bare ground (a common
   result of efforts to control invasive species) to native species
   establishment depends on both native species and invader seed density.
   These results suggest that a threshold of P. arundinacea propagule
   pressure exists, beyond which transition to a native community is less
   likely without management intervention. P. arundinacea can establish in
   the presence of a newly developing native plant community, even at very
   low densities of P. arundinacea seed. Invader control (following initial
   site clearing efforts) is essential to native species establishment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a Belgian case study on the Index of
   Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW). The index is first compiled using
   the standard methodology applied in other international studies. Owing
   to the short period in which Belgium's `traditional' ISEW has recently
   declined, it is not possible to draw any solid conclusion regarding
   Max-Neefs; `threshold hypothesis'. After a brief review of the criticism
   that the ISEW has attracted over the years, the paper then explains and
   discusses the rationale for omitting the `net capital growth' and
   `change in net international investment position' items. It is argued
   that these items do not comply with the theoretical foundation
   underpinning the ISEW. The paper also puts forward new valuation methods
   for several items within the index: the escalation factor in the
   valuation of natural capital depletion is dropped, long-term
   environmental damage is valued using a stock-based approach and
   considerably more government expenditures are considered to be
   non-defensive. The results of the `revised' ISEW show significant
   improvements in sustainable economic welfare over the entire study
   period. These findings are not in line with the `threshold hypothesis'.
   Finally, the paper offers some guidelines for communicating about the
   ISEW - namely that (a) all methodological assumptions should be made
   explicit and (b) all raw (unadjusted) data used should be included in
   any final ISEW report so as to enable the reader to make his or her own
   assessment about the assumptions the researcher has employed. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{Landscape context influences many aspects of songbird ecology during the

   for migrating songbirds, however, has received less attention. In
   particular, landscape context may affect the availability and quality of
   food for refueling during stopovers, which is critical for successful
   migration. We evaluated the influence of woody habitat cover in the
   surroundings of stopover sites at several spatial extents on the hourly
   changes of body mass in two species of European-African forest-dwelling
   songbird migrants (Willow Warbler, Phylloscopus trochilus, and the
   Eurasian Redstart, Phoenicurus phoenicurus). Data were sampled by
   standardized methods from a network of ringing stations throughout
   Europe during the falls of 1994-1996. In both species, hourly body mass
   gain calculated for first captures increased with woody habitat cover.
   We found a similar logarithmic relationship for both species, although
   for Willow Warblers mass gain was more strongly related to the habitat
   cover within 5 km, in contrast to 3 km for Redstarts. For Willow
   Warblers, where sufficient data are available for each year, the
   relationship is consistent over the years. The shape of the relationship
   suggests existence of a threshold of landscape suitability for refueling
   at stopover sites: in sites with less than 10\% of woody habitat cover,
   birds tend to lose body mass or to gain mass at a lower rate.}},

   subset of 22 stations. Strong collinearities were observed between some
   total recoverable or reactive metal concentrations in sediment; two
   principal clusters, including collinear metals, were obtained. The first
   one included metals of mainly geological origin (Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni),
   while the second one included As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn, which likely derive
   mainly from point sources of anthropogenic contamination. Each element
   also showed collinearity between their total recoverable and reactive
   forms (0.65 <= r <= 0.97). We can conclude that both chemical forms are
   equivalent for use in statistical models needed to explain biological
   responses and also in screening risk assessment. However, these
   relationships are not always proportional. Lower availability
   percentages were observed for Cd, Cu and Zn in the highly
   mixed-contaminated area of the Montreal Harbour, even though
   concentrations in sediment were higher. We observed a significant
   correlation (0.50 <= r <= 0.56) between concentrations in chironomids
   and concentrations of both total recoverable and reactive Cr and Pb in
   sediment. Arsenic was an exception, with accumulation by chironomids
   being highly related to reactive sediment concentrations. Finally, we
   observed variable influences of explanatory factors (e.g. sediment grain
   size, Al, Fe, Mn, S, TOC), depending on which metal or metalloid was
   being predicted in chironomids. In this context, it is difficult to
   choose a universal predictive method to explain the bioaccumulation of
   specific metals, and more research is still needed into normalization
   procedures that consider a combination of explanatory factors. (C) 2007

   Summarizing the temporal data (data reduction) will necessarily
   introduce some form of uncertainty which must be taken into account.
   Fuzzy numbers can represent this uncertainty in a conservative way
   without any statistical a priori hypothesis. This method has been
   employed for ocean floor geographical data by Patrikalakis (1995), in
   the interval case, and Anile et al. (2000), for fuzzy numbers, and to

Abstract = {{Global sources of change offer unprecedented challenges to conventional
   river management strategies, which no longer appear capable of credibly
   addressing a trap: the failure of conventional river defense engineering
   to manage rising trends of disordering extreme events, including
   frequency and intensity of floods, droughts, and water stagnation in the
   Hungarian reaches of the Tisza River Basin. Extreme events punctuate
   trends of stagnation or decline in the ecosystems, economies, and
   societies of this river basin that extend back decades, and perhaps,
   centuries. These trends may be the long-term results of defensive
   strategies of the historical river management regime that reflect a
   paradigm dating back to the Industrial Revolution: ``Protect the
   Landscape from the River.{''} Since then all policies have defaulted to
   the imperatives of this paradigm such that it became the convention
   underlying the current river management regime. As an exponent of this
   convention the current river management regimes' methods, concepts,
   infrastructure, and paradigms that reinforce one another in setting the
   basin's development trajectory, have proven resilient to change from
   wars, political, and social upheaval for centuries. Failure to address
   the trap makes the current river management regime's resilience appear
   detrimental to the region's future development prospects and prompts
   demand for transformation to a more adaptive river management regime.
   Starting before transition to democracy, a shadow network has generated
   multiple dialogues in Hungary, informally exploring the roots of this

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Drylands cover 41\% of the terrestrial surface and support > 36\% of the
   world's population. However, the magnitude of dryland degradation is
   unknown at regional and global spatial scales and at 15-30-yr temporal
   scales. Historical archives of > 30 yr of Landsat satellite imagery
   exist and allow local to global monitoring and assessment of a
   landscape's natural resources in response to climatic events and human
   activities. Vegetation indices (VIs), i.e., proxies of vegetation
   characteristics such as phytomass, can be derived from the spectral
   properties of Landsat imagery. A dynamical systems analysis method
   called mean-variance analysis can be used to describe and quantify
   dynamic regimes of VI response to disturbance using characteristics of
   ecological resilience, particularly amplitude and malleability, from a
   change detection perspective. Amplitude is the magnitude of response of
   a VI to a disturbance; malleability is the degree of recovery of a
   resource after a disturbance. Spatially aggregate and spatially explicit
   (image) differencing are methods whereby a VI image or statistic from
   one time period is subtracted from a VI image or statistic from another
   time period. To illustrate this method, we used a time series of Landsat
   imagery from 1972 to 1987 to measure the response of vegetation
   communities that are managed by subsistence agropastoral communities to
   the severe 1982-1984 El Nino-induced drought on the Bolivian Altiplano.
   We found that the entire landscape had decreased vegetation cover,
   increased variance (diagnostic of a regime shift), and thus, increased
   susceptibility to soil erosion during the drought. The wet meadow
   vegetation cover class had the lowest amplitude and thus the most
   resilience relative to other vegetation cover classes. This response
   identified the wet meadow as a key resource, as well as a harbinger of
   climate change for agropastoral communities in areas where drought is an
   endemic stressor.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Understanding the shape of the concentration-response curve
   for particles is important for public health, and lack of such
   understanding was recently cited by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
   (EPA) as a reason for not tightening the standards. Similarly, the delay
   between changes in exposure and changes in health is also important in
   public health decision making. We addressed these issues using an
   extended follow-up of the Harvard Six Cities Study.
   METHODS: Cox proportional hazards models were fit controlling for
   smoking, body mass index, and other covariates. Two approaches were
   used. First, we used penalized splines, which fit a flexible functional
   form to the concentration response to examine its shape, and chose the
   degrees of freedom for the curve based on Akaike's information
   criterion. Because the uncertainties around the resultant curve do not
   reflect the uncertainty in model choice, we also used model averaging as
   an alternative approach, where multiple models are fit explicitly and
   averaged, weighted by their probability of being correct given the data.
   We examined the lag relationship by model averaging across a range of
   unconstrained distributed lag models.
   RESULTS: We found that the concentration-response curve is linear,
   clearly continuing below the current U.S. standard of 15 mu g/m(3), and
   that the effects of changes in exposure on mortality are seen within two
   years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in particle concentrations below U.S. EPA
   standards would increase life expectancy.}},

Abstract = {{Sava River is a transboundary river of supra-regional interest, draining
   95,719 km(2) in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia.
   It is a typical Alpine river, flowing from Julian Alps. On entering
   Croatia, it becomes a typical lowland river. The possible influence of
   sediments of the sub-basins of Savinja, Krka and Kupa rivers on the
   sediments of the main course of Sava River was studied.
   Mineralogical composition was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and
   chemical composition by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy
   (ICP-MS). Two different procedures to identify anomalous geochemical
   data, the box plot method and the median absolute deviation (MAD), were
   used.
   Results obtained by the box plot method showed that anomalous
   concentrations (extremes or outliers) of Zn, Ph, In, Cu, Co, Se, Zr, Cd,
   As, K, Na, Tl, Ba, B, Mn, and Fe are present in sediments of the Celje
   region, as well as of Cr, Ni, S, In, Cu, Mo, Ph in Moste dam (pollution
   traced down to Camping Sobec), and of Hg in Litija-Zagorje mining
   region. The MAD method is more sensitive, and depicts the same polluted
   areas, but with more anomalous values, which are above threshold values
   for toxicity.
   The results of the selected toxic elements, with concentrations limiting
   the quality of freshwater sediments, are particularly discussed. Both
   statistical methods (box plot detection method and MAD method) show two
   anomalous values for Hg in Sava River near Kranj and Zagorje. The
   concentrations are much higher than those causing significant toxic
   effects >>2 ppm. Two locations of Sava River in Croatia (Strelecko and
   Lukavec Posavski) show a very clean environment with respect to trace
   elements, although Sava River passed big cities of Zagreb and Sisak. The
   results clearly indicate self-purification mechanisms of Sava River.
   A similar future sediment study is recommended on middle and lower Sava
   drainage basin, of interest for Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and
   Serbia, to detect possible pollution centers. In the case of significant
   pollution, remediation measures should be applied to improve sediment
   quality and management.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach to population-level assessment was applied in order to
   demonstrate its utility in estimating and managing the risk of zinc in a
   water environment. Much attention has been paid to population-level risk
   assessment, but there have been no attempts to determine a safe
   population-level concentration as an environmental criterion. Based on
   the published results of toxicity tests for various species, we first
   theoretically derived a threshold concentration at which a population
   size is unchanged due to the adverse effects of zinc exposure. To derive
   a zinc concentration that will protect populations in natural
   environments, we adopted the concept of species sensitivity
   distribution. Assuming the threshold concentrations of a set of species
   are log-normally distributed, we calculated the 95\% protection level of
   zinc (PHC5 :population-level hazardous concentration of 5\% of species),
   which is 107 mu g/L. Meanwhile, the 95\% protection criterion (HC5)
   based on conventional individual-level chronic toxicity, was calculated
   to be 14.6 mu g/L. The environmentally safe concentration for a
   population-level endpoint is about 7 times greater than that for an
   individual-level endpoint. The proposed method provides guidance for a
   pragmatic approach to population-level ecological risk assessment and

Abstract = {{The 1989 Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Act (TURA) instituted a
   preventive approach to chemical pollution and wastes: reducing toxic
   chemicals at the source through prevention planning, public reporting of
   chemical input, and fees for chemical use. The act also created the
   Massachusetts Office of Technical Assistance for Toxics Use Reduction
   (OTA), a voluntary program, to make onsite visits to companies that
   request assistance. OTA staff review the use of toxic chemicals at the
   facility, and make recommendations for either using substitutes, or
   using the chemicals more efficiently, Because TURA requires covered
   companies (large quantity toxics users) to report chemical input (what
   they use), output (resulting chemical waste), and a production index, it
   is possible to measure trends in toxics use relative to production, and
   waste byproduct per pound of chemical use input. These are uniquely
   precise measurements of a company's ability to accomplish the form of
   pollution prevention known as toxics use reduction.
   From 1993 to 2002, companies used approximately 500 million pounds (227
   million kg) less toxic chemicals than they were expected to use, based
   on past performance. Those companies that received onsite technical
   assistance visits from OTA made substantially greater improvements in
   TUR performance than those not visited, and as compared to their own
   performance after being visited. They reduced an average of 9.4\% more
   toxics use after being visited than before, and the difference was
   statistically significant. More companies in the visited group made
   progress than companies not visited, and had greater reductions than
   those not visited by nearly all measures.
   The results of two additional studies supported these findings of
   program effectiveness. One study examined companies that dropped out of
   the system, and found that those that were visited employed toxics use
   reduction to achieve below-threshold use amounts more frequently than
   those that were not visited. The other study, an independent research
   project using econometric methods to determine the causative relevance
   of provided assistance, found OTA's service to be an explanatory factor
   associated with significant toxics use and byproduct reductions. (C)

Abstract = {{Many different methods of synthesizing and analyzing environmental

   management action. Control charts, originally developed for industrial
   applications, represent one way of doing this. Control charts indicate
   when a system is going `out of control' by plotting through time some
   measure of a stochastic process with reference to its expected value.
   Control charts can be constructed for many different types of
   indicators, whether univariate or multivariate. Control charts are
   simple to interpret, and can easily be updated whenever additional data
   become available. The relative risks of Type I (i.e., concluding
   meaningful change has occurred when actually it has not) and Type 11
   (i.e., concluding meaningful change has not occurred when in fact it
   has) errors are intuitive and easily adjusted, and one may define a
   threshold for action at any desired level. Control charts may often be
   more informative than traditional statistical analyses such as
   regressions or parameter estimation with confidence intervals. The
   primary challenge in most situations will be determining a stable or

Abstract = {{The dynamics of landscape change are closely linked to the dynamics of
   land tenure-the societal institutions (organizations, rules, fights and
   restrictions) that control the allocation and use of land and its
   associated resources by people. Land tenure occurs over a characteristic
   set of spatial and temporal scales. Understanding the nature of
   variation in land tenure in space and time is an important step towards
   developing a deeper understanding of land tenure change and its impacts
   on societies and ecosystems. In this paper we develop a new method of
   characterizing and exploring spatial and temporal variation in land
   tenure, focusing on the potential for dynamic feedbacks between
   variation in space and variation in time. The primary objective of this
   research is to develop a robust set of methods that can be used to make
   inferences about pattern-process linkages across multiple scales in
   landscapes that contain interlinked social and ecological systems. We
   apply our approach to the analysis of a 30-year data set of land
   ownership in part of Hamilton County (north central Florida) and find
   strong evidence for positive feedbacks between spatial and temporal
   variation. Our results suggest that spatial and temporal variation in
   land tenure interact strongly, raising the interesting possibility that
   strategic purchases of land in ecologically important areas may serve to
   limit habitat fragmentation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.. All rights

Abstract = {{In polluted district of Michalovce in East Slovakia (POLL) and two
   districts with background pollution (BCGR) 2046 adults (834 males and
   1212 females aged 20-75 years) were examined. Serum levels of
   thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3)
   and antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOab) were estimated by
   electrochemiluminiscent assay and also these of 15 polychlorinated
   biphenyl congeners (PCBs), p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, hexachloro benzene (HCB)
   and hexachlorocyclohexane were measured by high resolution gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry. In addition, also dioxins, furans,
   coplanar- and mono-ortho-PCBs as well as selected hydroxylated and
   methylsulphonated PCBs and DDE metabolites were measured by appropriate
   methods based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry principle. In POLL
   significantly higher levels of all organochlorines were found than these
   in BCGR. When pooled values from both areas were stratified in terms of
   PCBs level and treated as continuous variables, positive association of
   PCBs with FT4 and TT3 was found, the latter two being also mutually
   associated. However, within the category of PCBs level <530 ng/g lipid
   (n = 232) the association between PCBs and both the FT4 (p < 0.09) and
   TT3 (p < 0.03) was negative and any association of these was not found
   within the category of PCBs level of 531-1000 ng/g (n 69 1). In
   contrast, in the category of 531-2000 ng/g (n = 1307) positive
   association appeared between PCBs and FT4 (p < 0.001) as well as TT3 (1)
   < 0.05). Highly significant association of PCBs with FT4 (p < 0.001) was
   further found in the categories with PCBs level of 1001-101414 ng/g (n =
   1307) and 2001-101414 (n = 1123), while significant association with TT3
   was observed only in the category of 531-2000 ng/g. Such findings
   suggest possible threshold level in positive effect of PCBs on FT4 and
   TT3 level which seems to be individual and located somewhere around the
   PCBs level of 1000 ng/g. However, highly significant negative
   association of both FT4 and TT3 with TSH was found in each of above
   indicated PCBs categories. Considerable difference in FT4 and TT3 level
   between large groups of subjects with the same range of PCBs level was
   also found suggesting different individual susceptibility to the effects
   of organochlorines. Among a total of 26 cases from POLL with very low
   TSH level (<0.5 mU l(-1)) 13 cases showed very high level of PCBs, FT4
   and TT3, thus supporting a hypothesis on a novel sporadic form of high
   PCBs related peripheral subclinical hyperthyroidism possibly resulting
   from the long-term disruption of equilibrium between bound and free
   thyroxine in plasma by high PCBs level followed by a striking inhibition
   of TSH release from the pituitary. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Domoic acid (DA) is a neurotoxin produced by diatoms of the
   genus Pseudonitzschia that targets the limbic system to induce
   tonic-clonic seizures and memory impairment. In utero DA exposure of
   mice leads to a reduction in seizure threshold to subsequent DA
   exposures in mid-postnatal life, and similar studies have shown
   neurotoxic effects in rats that were delayed until adolescence.
   OBJECTIVE: We used in ovo microinjection of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to
   characterize the effect of embryonic exposure of DA on seizure-inducing
   agents later in life as an alternative species model to screen
   environmental contaminants that might induce a fetal-originating adult
   disease.
   METHODS: Embryos were microinjected within hours of fertilization to DA
   concentrations ranging from 0.12 to 1.26 ng/mg egg weight. Seven days
   later, the larval animals were characterized for sensitivity to the
   chemical convulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), an agent that is
   well-defined in laboratory rodents and, more recently, in zebrafish.
   RESULTS: In ovo DA exposure, most significantly at 0.4 ng/mg, reduces
   the latency time until first PTZ seizure in larval fish and increases
   the severity of seizures as determined by seizure stage and movement
   parameters. The interaction between in ovo DA exposure and PTZ caused
   seizure behaviors to individually asymptomatic doses of PTZ (1.0 and
   1.25 mM) and DA (0.13 and 0.22 ng/mg).
   CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that in ovo exposure to DA reduces
   the threshold to chemically induced seizures in larval fish and
   increases the severity of seizure behavior in a manner that is
   consistent with in utero studies of laboratory rodents.}},

Title = {{Evaluation and application of the RD50 for determining acceptable

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2007}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The RD50 (exposure concentration producing a 50\%
   respiratory rate decrease) test evaluates airborne chemicals for sensory
   irritation and has become an American Society for Testing and Materials
   (ASTM) standard method. Past studies reported good correlations (R-2)
   between RD(50)s and the occupational exposure limits, particularly
   threshold limit values (TLVs).
   OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study was to examine the
   relationship between RD(50)s and human sensory irritation responses in a
   quantitative manner, particularly for chemicals that produce burning
   sensation of the eyes, nose, or throat, based on lowest observed adverse
   effect levels (LOAELs) reported for human subjects.
   METHODS: We compared RD50S with LOAELs and acute reference exposure
   levels (RELs). RELs, developed by the California Environmental
   Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment,
   represent a level at which no adverse effects are anticipated after
   exposure. We collected RD50S from the published literature and evaluated
   them for consistency with ASTM procedures. We identified LOAELs for
   human irritation and found 25 chemicals with a corresponding RD50 in
   mice.
   DISCUSSION: We found the relationship between RD(50)s and LOAELs as log
   RD50 = 1.16 (log LOAEL) + 0.77 with an R-2 value of 0.80. This strong
   correlation supports the use of the RD50 in establishing exposure limits
   for the public. We further identified 16 chemical irritants with both
   RD(50)s and corresponding acute RELs, and calculated the relationship as
   log RD50 = 0.71 (log REL) + 2.55 with an R-2 value of 0.71. This
   relationship could be used to identify health protective values for the
   public to prevent respiratory or sensory irritation.
   CONCLUSION: Consequently, we believe that the RD50 has benefits for use
   in setting protective levels for the health of both workers and the
   general population.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Many species are currently expanding their ranges in response to
   climate change, but the mechanisms underlying these range expansions are
   in many cases poorly understood. In this paper we explore potential
   climatic factors governing the recent establishment of new palm
   populations far to the north of any other viable palm population in the
   world.
   Location Southern Switzerland, Europe, Asia and the world.
   Methods We identified ecological threshold values for the target
   species, Trachycarpus fortunei, based on gridded climate data, altitude
   and distributional records from the native range and applied them to the
   introduced range using local field monitoring and measured
   meteorological data as well as a bioclimatic model.
   Results We identified a strong relationship between minimum winter
   temperatures, influenced by growing season length and the distribution
   of the palm in its native range. Recent climate change strongly
   coincides with the palm's recent spread into southern Switzerland, which
   is in concert with the expansion of the global range of palms across
   various continents.
   Main conclusions Our results strongly suggest that the expansion of
   palms into (semi-)natural forests is driven by changes in winter
   temperature and growing season length and not by delayed population
   expansion. This implies that this rapid expansion is likely to continue
   in the future under a warming climate. Palms in general, and T. fortunei
   in particular, are significant bioindicators across continents for
   present-day climate change and reflect a global signal towards warmer
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape connectivity is critical to species persistence in the face of
   habitat loss and fragmentation. Graph theory is a well-defined method
   for quantifying connectivity that has tremendous potential for ecology,
   but its application has been limited to a small number of conservation
   scenarios, each with a fixed proportion of habitat. Because it is
   important to distinguish changes in habitat configuration from changes
   in habitat area in assessing the potential impacts of fragmentation, we
   investigated two metrics that measure these different influences on
   connectivity. The first metric, graph diameter, has been advocated as a
   useful measure of habitat configuration. We propose a second area-based
   metric that combines information on the amount of connected habitat and
   the amount of habitat in the largest patch. We calculated each metric
   across gradients in habitat area and configuration using multifractal
   neutral landscapes. The results identify critical connectivity
   thresholds as a function of the level of fragmentation and a parallel is
   drawn between the behavior of graph theory metrics and those of
   percolation theory. The combination of the two metrics provides a means
   for targeting sites most at risk of suffering low potential connectivity

Abstract = {{Landscape analysis and delineation of habitat patches should take into
   account organism-specific behavioral and perceptual responses to
   landscape structure because different organisms perceive and respond to
   landscape features over different ranges of spatial scales. The commonly
   used methods for delineating habitat based on rules of contiguity do not
   account for organism-specific responses to landscape patch structure and
   have undesirable properties, such as being dependent on the scale of
   base map used for analysis. This paper presents an improved patch
   delineation algorithm, ``PatchMorph,{''} which can delineate patches
   across a range of spatial scales based on three organism-specific
   thresholds: (1) land cover density threshold, (2) habitat gap maximum
   thickness (gap threshold), and (3) habitat patch minimum thickness (spur
   threshold). This algorithm was tested on an ``idealized{''} landscape
   with landscape gaps and spurs of known size, and delineated patches as
   expected. It was then applied to delineate patches from a neutral random
   fractal landscape, which showed that as the input gap and spur thickness
   thresholds were increased, the number of patches decreased from 59 (low
   thresholds) patches to 1 (high thresholds). The algorithm was then
   applied to model western yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus
   occidentalis) nesting habitat patches based on spur and gap thresholds
   specific to this organism. Both these analyses showed that fewer patches
   were delineated by PatchMorph than by rules of contiguity, and those
   patches were larger, had smoother edges, and had fewer gaps within the
   patches. This algorithm has many applications beyond those presented in
   this paper, including habitat suitability analysis, spatially explicit
   population modeling, and habitat connectivity analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In water-limited environments of the intermountain region of North
   America, summer precipitation may play a role in the structure and
   function of aridland communities and ecosystems. This study examined the
   potential reliance on summer precipitation of two widespread, coexisting
   woody species in the southwestern United States, Pinus edulis Englmn.
   (Colorado pinon) and Juniperus osteosperma (Torr) Little (Utah juniper).
   The current distributions of P. edulis and J. osteosperma are highly
   suggestive of different dependencies on summer rainfall. We hypothesized
   that P. edulis was dependent on summer precipitation, utilizing summer
   precipitation even during extremely dry summers, whereas J. osteosperma
   was not dependent, using summer precipitation only when amounts were
   above some minimum threshold. Using sap flux and stable isotopic methods
   to assess seasonal water sources and water use efficiency, we examined
   the response of these two species to seasonal variations in moisture at
   a site located near the northern limits of the North American monsoon.
   Both sap flux and isotopic results indicated that P. edulis was
   responsive to summer rain, while J. osteosperma was not. Following
   summer rain events, sap flux density increased in P. edulis for several
   days, but not in J. osteosperma. Isotopic evidence indicated that P.
   edulis took up summer-derived moisture to a greater extent than J.
   osteosperma. Values of the natural abundance stable isotope ratio of
   carbon of leaf soluble carbohydrates increased over the summer for P.
   edulis, indicative of assimilation at higher water use efficiency, but
   were invariant for J. osteosperma. Our results supported the hypothesis
   that P. edulis and J. osteosperma are differentially sensitive to summer
   precipitation and are discussed in the light of potential changes in the
   seasonality of precipitation associated with climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Development projects that impact wetlands commonly require compensatory
   mitigation, usually through creation or restoration of wetlands on or
   off the project site. Over the last decade, federal support has
   increased for third-party off-site mitigation methods. At the same time,
   regulators have lowered the minimum impact size that triggers the
   requirement for compensatory mitigation. Few studies have examined the
   aggregate impact of individual wetland mitigation projects. No previous
   study has compared the choice of mitigation method by regulatory agency
   or development size. We analyze 1058 locally and federally permitted
   wetland mitigation transactions in the Chicago region between 1993 and
   2004. We show that decreasing mitigation threshold. have had striking
   effects on the methods and spatial distribution of wetland mitigation.
   In particular, the observed increase in mitigation bank use is driven
   largely by the needs of the smallest impacts. Conversely, throughout the
   time period studied, large developments have rarely used mitigation
   banking, and have been relatively unaffected by changing regulatory
   focus and banking industry growth. We surmise that small developments
   lack the scale economies necessary for feasible permittee responsible
   mitigation. Finally, we compare the rates at which compensation required
   by both county and federal regulators is performed across major
   watershed boundaries. We show that local regulations prohibiting
   cross-county mitigation lead to higher levels of cross-watershed
   mitigation than federal regulations without cross-county prohibitions.
   Our data suggest that local control over wetland mitigation may
   prioritize administrative boundaries over hydrologic function in the
   matter of selecting compensation sites.}},

Abstract = {{The destruction of arsenical shells from the 1914/18 war in the vicinity
   of Verdun (France) during the 1920s resulted in a locally limited but
   severe soil contamination by arsenic and heavy metals. At the study
   site, the main part of the contaminant inventory occurs in the upper 20
   cm of the topsoil which is essentially composed of combustion residues.
   Besides, some Cu (c(max) = 16,877 mg/kg) and Pb (c(max)=26,398 mg/kg) in
   this layer, As (c(max)=175,907 mg/kg) and Zn (c(max) = 133,237 mg/kg)
   were detected in very high concentrations. The mobilities of Cu, Mn, Pb
   and Zn in the soil system were derived from ammonium nitrate eluates.
   They are strongly influenced by the soil pH and can be described by
   quadratic regression curves from which threshold pH values were
   calculated. Below these values more than 10\% of the element content was
   available as mobile species. Within the examined pH range, this method
   could not be adopted for arsenic, because the mobility of As was only
   slightly controlled by the soil pH. In the heavily contaminated topsoil,
   Cu and Pb were fixed by the moderately acidic soil pH which varied from
   4.8 to 5.8. No migration to the underlying horizons occurred. A
   different behavior was observed for As and Zn. The calculated threshold
   pH of Zn was 5.5, so certain amount of this element was transferred to
   the subsoil and the leachate (c(max) = 350 mu g/l). However, a major
   dispersion of Zn was prevented by a rise of the soil pH in the
   carbonate-containing subsoil. Elevated concentrations of As were found
   in all soil horizons up to a depth of 2 m and also in the leachate
   (c(max) = 23 77 mu g/l). Contrary to Cu, Pb and Zn the mobility of As
   evidently was less affected by the subsoil.
   Regarding organic contaminants, nitroaromatic explosives were detected
   only in minor concentrations in the soil (c(max.) = 14.7 mg/kg) and the
   leachate (c(max.)= 13.5 mu g/l). No aromatic organoarsenicals were
   detected in the soil and the leachate samples.
   The main hazard of the site is the severe arsenic contamination and the
   transfer of this carcinogen by leachate, surface runoff and probably by
   wind. Nevertheless, some studies on the effects of the contaminant
   inventory on the local vegetation revealed that ammonium nitrate
   elutable zinc is responsible for the spatial distribution of some
   tolerant plant species and not arsenic.
   Previously undetected buried munitions from the former delaboration
   facility can be an other source of environmental contaminants. This is
   supported by elevated concentrations of chlorate (c(max).=71 mg/l) and
   perchlorate (c(max.)=0.8 mg/l) detected in the leachate samples.

   population communities described by piecewise smooth models (known as
   Filippov systems). Models of this kind are often used to describe
   populations with selective switching between alternative habitats or
   diets or to mimic the evolution of an exploited resource where
   harvesting is forbidden when the resource is below a prescribed
   threshold. The analysis is carried out by performing the bifurcation
   analysis of the model with respect to two parameters. A relatively
   simple method, called the puzzle method, is proposed to construct the
   complete bifurcation diagram step-by-step. The method is illustrated
   through four examples concerning the exploitation and protection of

Abstract = {{We integrated basic concepts from fisheries science and toxicological
   risk assessment to form a potential method for setting screening-level,
   risk-based, site-specific water quality objectives for temperature. In
   summary, the proposed approach: (a) uses temperature impacts upon
   specific growth as a measure of chronic (cumulative) temperature
   effects; (b) explicitly incorporates the consequences of both magnitude
   and cumulative duration of exposures; (c) adjusts the result for local
   watershed conditions, reducing the likelihood that naturally warm
   systems are identified as thermally polluted while helping to ensure
   that naturally cool systems are closely monitored for ecologically
   harmful changes in thermal regime; and (d) expresses the net result both
   graphically and as a risk quotient, RQ, closely analogous to that used
   in toxicological risk assessments. The latter yields a site-specific,
   risk-based water quality objective and may serve as a straightforward
   decision rule for environmental managers. The method was applied to
   historical data from a small British Columbia stream subject to
   increasing urban development pressures. We also illustrate how the
   technique might be used to explore potential climatic change impacts,
   using coupled general circulation model predictions in conjunction with
   empirical downscaling. Overall, the method and results are presented as
   an introduction and illustration of concept, intended as a step toward
   the development of a logistically feasible risk-based approach to
   establishing screening-level, site-specific water temperature
   objectives, and monitoring compliance, in the context of large-scale,
   many-site, environmental monitoring networks. With further work, the
   technique offers potential to fill the gap between the temperature
   threshold-based targets typically specified in regulatory guidelines,
   which may be hydroecologically unrealistic, and detailed biophysical
   modelling, which typically is logistically infeasible in a day-to-day
   environmental monitoring and management context.}},

   significant noise exposure and smoking history were recruited to

   different frequencies (250 to 8,000 Hz) of better ear were measured in
   an audiometric booth by using the ascending method in 2 dB steps before
   each exposure condition. The test was also carried out after exposure to

   an audiometric test on all subjects at post-exposure times of 2, 20, 40,
   60, 80 and 120 min, respectively. It was found that TTS depended mainly
   on the exposed noise dose and was enhanced by workload and heat stress.
   The TTS recovery time is dependent upon the magnitude of the initial

Abstract = {{Aim To provide a quantitative spatial analysis of the riverscape
   (open-water bodies and their surrounding areas) of the Western Amazonian
   lowlands using a consistent surface of remotely sensed imagery. Taking
   into account the essential significance of fluvial environments for the
   Amazonian biota, we propose that an enhanced understanding of the
   Amazonian riverscape will provide new insight for biogeographical
   studies in the region and contribute to the understanding of these
   megadiverse tropical lowlands.
   Location An area of 2.2 million km(2) covering the Western Amazonian
   lowlands of the Andean foreland region, i.e. the upper reaches of the
   Amazon river system. Areas in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil
   and Bolivia between longitudes 83 degrees W and 65 degrees W and
   latitudes 5 degrees N and 12 degrees S are included.
   Methods A mosaic of 120 Landsat TM satellite images was created with
   100-m resolution, and water areas of over I ha in size or c. 60 m in
   width were extracted using a simple ratio threshold applicable to a
   large set of data. With this method, 99.1\% of the water areas present
   in 30-m imagery were mapped with images with 100-m resolution. Water
   pixels of distinct river segments were assigned to river classes on the
   basis of their channel properties, and islands and lakes were
   distinguished separately and classified. Measures of water patterns such
   as structure, composition, richness and remoteness were provided for
   various spatial units. Riverine corridors were computed from the
   open-water mask by outer limits of active channels and floodplain lakes.
   Analytical results are shown as both thematic maps and statistics.
   Results A total of 1.1\% of Western Amazonia is covered by open-water
   bodies over 1 ha in size or 60 m in width. River-bound waters comprise
   98\% of the total water surface. Whilst isolated lakes are scarce,
   river-bound oxbow and backchannel lakes are plentiful, comprising 17.5\%
   of all waters. They are particularly frequent along meandering channels,
   which dominate both in area and length. The riverine corridors including
   active channels and floodplain lakes cover 17\% of the land area. The
   average distance from any point of land to the nearest water is 12 km.
   Geographically speaking, the distribution of waters is uneven across the
   region, and the detailed characteristics of the riverscape are
   geographically highly variable. Three major, fluvially distinct regions
   can be identified: central Western Amazonia, the south, and the
   nortb-east. The proportional surface areas of the riverine corridors,
   numbers of lakes, sizes of islands and their distributions depend
   largely on the types and sizes of the rivers.
   Main conclusions Our results support the notion of Western Amazonia as a
   dynamic, highly fluvial environment, highlighting and quantifying
   considerable internal variation within the region in terms of fluvial
   patterns and the processes that they reflect and control.
   Biogeographically, the variety of types of fluvial environments and
   their characteristics are important constituents of what influences the
   distribution of species and dynamics of terrestrial habitats. Spatially
   consistent riverscape data can serve as a consistent and scalable source
   of relevant information for other biogeographical approaches in the
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To test statistical models used to predict species distributions
   under different shapes of occurrence-environment relationship. We
   addressed three questions: (1) Is there a statistical technique that has
   a consistently higher predictive ability than others for all kinds of
   relationships? (2) How does species prevalence influence the relative
   performance of models? (3) When an automated stepwise selection
   procedure is used, does it improve predictive modelling, and are the
   relevant variables being selected?
   Location We used environmental data from a real landscape, the state of
   California, and simulated species distributions within this landscape.
   Methods Eighteen artificial species were generated, which varied in
   their occurrence response to the environmental gradients considered
   (random, linear, Gaussian, threshold or mixed), in the interaction of
   those factors (no interaction vs. multiplicative), and on their
   prevalence (50\% vs. 5\%). The landscape was then randomly sampled with
   a large (n = 2000) or small (n = 150) sample size, and the predictive
   ability of each statistical approach was assessed by comparing the true
   and predicted distributions using five different indexes of performance
   (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve, Kappa,
   correlation between true and predictive probability of occurrence,
   sensitivity and specificity). We compared generalized additive models
   (GAM) with and without flexible degrees of freedom, logistic regressions
   (general linear models, GLM) with and without variable selection,
   classification trees, and the genetic algorithm for rule-set production
   (GARP).
   Results Species with threshold and mixed responses, additive
   environmental effects, and high prevalence generated better predictions
   than did other species for all statistical models. In general, GAM
   outperforms all other strategies, although differences with GLM are
   usually not significant. The two variable-selection strategies presented
   here did not discriminate successfully between truly causal factors and
   correlated environmental variables.
   Main conclusions Based on our analyses, we recommend the use of GAM or
   GLM over classification trees or GARP, and the specification of any
   suspected interaction terms between predictors. An expert-based variable
   selection procedure was preferable to the automated procedures used
   here. Finally, for low-prevalence species, variability in model
   performance is both very high and sample-dependent. This suggests that
   distribution models for species with low prevalence can be improved
   through targeted sampling.}},

Abstract = {{Mathematical morphology encompasses methods for characterizing

   This paper reports a neutral model analysis of patterns in the absence
   of a structuring ecological process, to help set standards for comparing
   and interpreting patterns identified by mathematical morphology on real
   land-cover maps. We considered six structural classes (core, perforated,
   edge, connector, branch, and patch) on randomly generated binary
   (forest, non-forest) maps in which the percent occupancy (P) of forest
   varied from 1\% to 99\%. The maps were dominated by the patch class for
   low P, by the branch and connector classes for intermediate P, and by
   the edge, perforated, and core classes for high P. Two types of pattern
   phase changes were signaled by abrupt transitions among the six
   structural classes, at critical P thresholds that were indicated by
   increased variance among maps for the same P. A phase change from maps
   dominated by the patch class to maps dominated by the branch and
   connector classes was related to the existence of a percolating cluster
   of forest, and the P threshold varied depending on the co-existence of
   the core class. A second phase change from the edge class to the
   perforated class was related to the existence of a percolating cluster
   of non-core (including non-forest) and represents a change of context
   from exterior to interior. Our results appear to be the first
   demonstration of multiple phase changes controlling different aspects of
   landscape pattern on random neutral maps. Potential applications of the
   results are illustrated by an analysis of ten real forest maps.}},

Abstract = {{This study quantified and evaluated the greenhouse gas emissions of
   farmland soils at a watershed scale using parameters available at a
   regional scale. The estimation was based on field monitoring data in the
   Ikushunbetsu River Watershed, Hokkaido, Japan. Simple regression models
   were created for carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane emissions
   associated with six major agricultural land uses, and forest as an
   alternative land use to farmland. An eco-balance method involves
   conducting an analysis on the basis of farmland surplus nitrogen (N) and
   global warming potential (GWP). Uncertainties associating the
   estimations were estimated using Mote Carlo simulation. The eco-balance
   is the analysis of the relationship between production and environmental
   load. In this study, production and environmental load were compared by
   changing each of the land use combinations by 10\%. Farmland surplus N
   was lowest for soybean with 8.2 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), followed by paddy
   rice. The highest value was recorded for vegetables with 99.8 kg N
   ha(-1) year(-1). The weighted mean of total farmland based on the land
   use proportion was 44 +/- 33.8 kg N ha-1 year(-1). The calculated GWP
   was 7.3 Mg CO2 eq ha(-1) year(-1) for paddy rice and 0.1 to 6.8 Mg CO2
   eq ha(-1) year(-1) for upland crops. The weighted mean of the total
   farmland area was 4.0 +/- 3.4 Mg CO2 eq ha(-1) year(-1). The eco-balance
   analysis showed that there were 59 combinations out of 8008 combinations
   able to reduce GWP more than 6\%, but less than 7\%, than the value in
   2005. Among them, in 30 combinations, farmland surplus N became less
   than the value in 2005; production was reduced compared with the value
   in 2005 in 27 combinations. Soybean occupied 20-80\% in the seven
   combinations where production was increased compared with 2005, while
   keeping farmland surplus N below the value in 2005. The estimation of
   greenhouse gases in this study exhibited high uncertainty because of
   variability in management and errors in evaluation procedures.
   Quantification of the data variability is set at maximum, which
   comprises the measured values in this area. Based on the quantification
   of the uncertainty, more efficient quantification methods can be
   established to clarify mitigation potential. This type of quantification
   and comparison between production and emission enables decision makers
   to set some threshold values that allow a compromise between production
   and environmental load.}},

Abstract = {{Metal sludge from industrial wastewater treatment plants was mixed with
   mining residues to be recycled into lightweight aggregate (LWA) through
   sintering at different temperatures. The physical properties of the LWA
   thus obtained were examined by scanning electron microscopy analyzer
   (SEM) coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX). The
   sequential extraction method combined with inductively coupled plasma
   atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was employed to determine the
   concentration and distribution of hazardous toxic elements in the metal
   sludge-based artificial LWA. The results show that the leaching
   concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, and Pb present in the non-sintered raw
   aggregate pellets reached 7.4, 68.0, 96.0, and 61.4 mg/l, respectively,
   far exceeding the regulatory threshold. Sintering at 1 150 degrees C for
   15 ruin results in stronger chemical bonds being formed between the
   elements. Hence, after the first three steps of sequential extraction,
   the concentrations of Cr, Cu, and Pb reached 2.69, 1.50, and 1. 88 mg/1
   at 1150 degrees C, while the final residues had total concentrations of
   96.1, 88.4, and 60.6 mg/kg, respectively, with Cd undetected in both
   phases. The concentration levels fell within the regulatory threshold,
   indicating that the LWA fabricated from recycled metal sludge contains
   elements that are toxic and hazardous but not leached. Having no harmful
   effect on the environment, the metal sludge-based artificial LWA is not
   only safe but also practical with good physical properties. (C) 2006

Volume = {{43}},

Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{{[}1] A large number of models in hydrology and climate sciences rely on
   multiple linear regression to explain the link between key variables.
   The relationship in the physical world may experiment sudden changes
   because of climatic, environmental, or anthropogenic perturbations. To
   deal with this issue, a Bayesian method of multiple changepoint
   detection in multiple linear regression is proposed in this paper. It is
   an adaptation of the recursion-based multiple changepoint method of
   Fearnhead (2005, 2006) to the classical multiple linear model. A new
   class of priors for the parameters of the multiple linear model is
   introduced, and useful formulas are derived that permit straightforward
   computation of the posterior distribution of the changepoints. The
   proposed method is numerically efficient and does not involve time
   consuming Monte-Carlo Markov Chain simulation as opposed to other
   Bayesian changepoint methods. It allows fast and straightforward
   simulation of the probability of each possible number of changepoints as
   well as the posterior probability distribution of each changepoint
   conditional on the number of changes. The approach is validated on
   simulated data sets and then compared to the methodology of Seidou et
   al. (2006) on two practical problems, as follows: (1) the changepoint
   detection in the multiple linear relationship between mean basin scale
   precipitation at different periods of the year and the summer-autumn
   flood peaks of the Broadback River located in Northern Quebec, Canada;
   and (b) the detection of trend variations in the streamflows of the
   Ogoki River located in the province of Ontario, Canada.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Environmental asbestos pollution can cause malignant
   mesothelioma, but few studies have involved dose-response analyses with
   detailed information on occupational, domestic, and environmental
   exposures.
   OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we examined the spatial variation of
   mesothelioma risk in an area with high levels of asbestos pollution from
   art industrial plant, adjusting for occupational and domestic exposures.
   METHODS: This population-based case-control study included 103 incident
   cases of mesothelioma and 272 controls in 1987-1993 in the area around
   Casale Monferrato, Italy, where an important asbestos cement plant had
   been active for decades. Information collected included lifelong
   occupational and residential histories. Mesothelioma risk. was estimated
   through logistic regression and a mixed additive-multiplicative model in
   which an additive scale was assumed for the risk associated with both
   residential distance from the plant and occupational exposures. The
   adjusted excess risk gradient by residential distance was modeled as an
   exponential decay with a threshold.
   RESULTS: Residents at the location of the asbestos cement factory had a
   relative risk for mesothelioma of 10.5 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI),
   3.8-50.1), adjusted for occupational and domestic exposures. Risk
   decreased rapidly with increasing distance from the factory, but at
   10-km the risk was still 60\% of its value at the source. The relative
   risk for occupational exposure was 6.0 (95\% CI, 2.9-13.0), but this
   increased to 27.5 (95\% CI, 7.8-.153.4) when adjusted for residential
   distance.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study provides strong evidence that asbestos pollution
   from an industrial source greatly increases mesothelioma risk.
   Furthermore, relative risks from occupational exposure were
   underestimated and were markedly increased when adjusted for residential
   distance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Ballooning is the main dispersal mode in small spiders, by
   which individuals are carried by wind currents as spheres attached to
   thin silk threads. It involves a typical and unique pre-dispersal
   `tiptoe' behaviour that can easily be observed under laboratory
   conditions.
   Hypotheses: Is the ballooning behaviour of a saltmarsh-inhabiting spider
   heritable? Do heritability estimates differ under two different
   environmental conditions (wind velocity)?
   Organism: Second-instar offspring from Pardosa purbeckensis (Lycosidae;
   Araneae).
   Site of experiments: Parents were collected in a large and a small
   saltmarsh. Offspring were tested for behavioural variation under
   standardized laboratory experiments.
   Methods: Ballooning motivation (tiptoe behaviour) was assessed at two
   wind velocities in wind tunnels. We conducted a quantitative (half-sib)
   genetic analysis of ballooning motivation and applied threshold models
   to estimate heritabilities under both wind conditions.
   Results: Heritability estimates were 0. 17 (standard error = 0.07) at
   low wind velocities and 0.42 (standard error= 0.21) at high wind
   velocities. Because of the absence of a genetic correlation among the
   two wind environments, independent selection on dispersal motivation

Abstract = {{Nonpoint-source pollution and water body eutrophication have become
   increasing concerns for scientists and policymakers. Nitrogen and
   phosphorus affect environmental pollution, especially lake
   eutrophication. To assess the environmental risk of soil total nitrogen
   (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) pollution, a typical ecological unit of
   Dongting Lake plain was selected as the experimental site. To verify the
   stationary of the data, a moving windows technique was adopted. Our
   results showed that Box-Cox transformation achieved normality in the
   data set and dampened the effect of outliers. The best theoretical model
   for semivariogram of TN and TP was a spherical model. The ordinary
   kriging estimates of TN and TP. concentrations were mapped. The
   integrative comparisons of semivariogram parameters with different
   trends to the kriging prediction errors of TN and TP indicated that the
   two-order trend is preferable. Kriging SDs provided valuable information
   that will increase the accuracy of TN and TP mapping. The probability
   kriging method is useful to assess the risk of N and P pollution by
   providing the conditional probability of N and P concentrations
   exceeding the threshold concentrations of 3.2 and 1.05 g/kg,
   respectively. The probability distribution of TN and TP at different
   levels will be helpful to conduct risk assessment, optimize
   fertilization, and control the pollution of N and F.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the ecotoxicological hazard potential of 42 pharmaceuticals
   from 22 therapeutic groups, including metabolites formed in humans. We
   treated each parent drug and its metabolites as a mixture of similarly
   acting compounds. If physicochemical or effect literature data were
   missing, we estimated these with quantitative structure-activity
   relationships (QSAR). Additionally, we estimated micropollutant removal
   efficiency of urine source separation using pharmaceutical information.
   On average, 50\% of a parent drug was metabolized, and 70\% was excreted
   with urine, albeit with large variations among drugs. Metabolism reduced
   the toxic potential of all but eight drugs. The subsequently modeled
   risk quotient was mostly below the threshold of one. However, ibuprofen
   and its metabolites in a mixture could pose an ecotoxicologal risk; and
   possibly also acetylsalicylic acid, bezafibrate, carbamazepine,
   diclofenac, fenofibrate, and paracetamol. Lipophilicity and sale
   quantities of parent drugs alone were insufficient to estimate their
   ecotoxicological risk. Urine separation could decrease the
   ecotoxicological risk of some, but not all drugs. The estimated risk
   quotients were equal in urine and feces, again with large variations
   among compounds. Because of scientific limitations of the model and
   inconsistent literature data the results are somewhat uncertain.
   However, this new approach allows first tier screening of single drugs,
   thus supporting decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological patterns are difficult to extract directly from vegetation
   data. The respective surveys provide a high number of interrelated
   species occurrence variables. Since often only a limited number of
   ecological gradients determine species distributions, the data might be
   represented by much fewer but effectively independent variables. This
   can be achieved by reducing the dimensionality of the data. Conventional
   methods are either limited to linear feature extraction (e.g., principal
   component analysis, and Classical Multidimensional Scaling, CMDS) or
   require a priori assumptions on the intrinsic data dimensionality (e.g.,
   Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling, NMDS, and self organized maps, SOM).
   In this study we explored the potential of Isometric Feature Mapping
   (Isomap). This new method of dimensionality reduction is a nonlinear
   generalization of CMDS. Isomap is based on a nonlinear geodesic
   inter-point distance matrix. Estimating geodesic distances requires one
   free threshold parameter, which defines linear geometry to be preserved
   in the global nonlinear distance structure. We compared Isomap to its
   linear (CMDS) and nonmetric NMDS) equivalents. Furthermore, the use of
   geodesic distances allowed also extending NMDS to a version that we
   called NMDS-G. In addition we investigated a supervised Isomap valiant
   (S-Isomap) and showed that all these techniques are interpretable within
   a single methodical framework.
   As an example we investigated seven plots (subdivided in 456 subplots)
   in different secondary tropical montane forests with 773 species of
   vascular plants. A key problem for the study of tropical vegetation data
   is the heterogeneous small scale variability implying large ranges of
   beta-diversity. The CMDS and NMDS methods did not reduce the data
   dimensionality reasonably. On the contrary, Isomap, explained 95\% of
   the data variance in the first five dimensions and provided ecologically
   interpretable visualizations; NMDS-G yielded similar results. The main
   shortcoming of the latter was the high computational cost and the
   requirement to predefine the dimension of the embedding space. The
   S-Isomap learning scheme did not improve the Isomap variant for an
   optimal threshold parameter but substantially improved the nonoptimal
   solutions.
   We conclude that Isomap as a new ordination method allows effective
   representations of high dimensional vegetation data sets. The method is
   promising since it does not require a priori assumptions, and is
   computationally highly effective.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{389-394}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Questions: Density dependence is thought to restrict exponential growth
   as well as give rise to size structure in populations. Size hierarchy in
   trees from tropical dry deciduous forests is studied to ask (1) whether
   nature of competition is symmetric or asymmetric and (2) what is the
   self thinning trajectory under a natural gradient of tree density.
   Location: Western India.
   Methods: Density was measured as the number of trees in 10-m radius
   circular plots (n = 96) and size was measured at DBH. Size variation was
   evaluated by the Gini coefficient (n = 1239 trees).
   Results: Size inequality between neighbours decreased with density but
   in a non-linear manner. In the backdrop of existing theory this
   indirectly suggests that competitive interactions may be symmetric over
   a `depletive' resource such as below-ground water (rather than a
   `pre-emptive' resource such as light), which is very plausible in a
   semi-arid environment. The self thinning coefficient derived from the
   relationship between stem diameter and density (y approximate to -1/4),
   is higher than expected from existing models of allometric plant growth
   (y approximate to -1/3) which are based on above-ground interactions
   alone. Seen in conjunction, these results suggest that above-ground
   structures, such as stem size, do not adequately represent the outcome
   of competitive interactions when below-ground resources, such as water,
   may be more important under semi-arid conditions.
   Conclusions: The non-linear relationship between size inequality and
   density indicates that there exists a density threshold beyond which
   investment in above-ground biomass becomes sluggish in semi-arid,
   deciduous forests. Since current allometric models do not incorporate
   below-ground biomass for trees, these data suggest that a more
   comprehensive allometric growth model may have higher predictive power
   and wider applicability.}},

Abstract = {{Based on analysis of water crisis during rapid urbanization especially
   in arid and semi-arid areas around the world, the concept of Water
   Resources Constraint Force (WRCF) is presented. The method utilized to
   identify the existence of WRCF is also introduced. After a logarithmic
   relationship model between urbanization level and total water
   utilization is established, the method to measure the WRCF on
   urbanization is also obtained. A case study of the Hexi Corridor, a
   typical arid area in NW China is presented. The results indicate that
   when the population, economic and urban scales approach or exceed the
   water resources carrying capacity, or the utilization of water resources
   approaches or exceeds the threshold of natural water resources, the
   water resources system significantly slows down the development of
   socio-economic systems, including the urbanization process. Furthermore,
   where the scarcer water resources are, the larger water resources
   constraint intensity (WRCI) is. In the Hexi Corridor, the WRCI is the
   largest in the Shiyang River Basin, in the eastern part, and where water
   resources are the scarcest. The WRCI in the middle and western part of
   the Hexi Corridor is relatively smaller because of relatively more water
   resources. Subsequently, areas within the Hexi Corridor should take a
   range of different measures to lessen the WRCF on urbanization according
   to their specific water resources constraint types: (1) Areas of the
   very strong constraint type should take emergency measures to resolve
   their water problems, including transferring water from other river
   basins, limiting the population, economic and urban scales, innovating
   in institution, policy and technology of water utilization, and
   strengthening water resources planning and management in the whole river
   basin; (2) areas of the less strong constraint type should avoid
   traditional methods of water utilization during the process of
   urbanization and industrialization in areas of the very strong
   constraint type. They should adjust the urbanization pattern and
   construct an intensive water resources utilization system, so that total
   water utilization can realize zero or negative growth and
   water-ecology-economy system can realize harmonic and sustainable
   development. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{663-673}},

Abstract = {{Questions: How will density-dependent and costly dispersal evolve in
   populations subject to local density regulation and environmental
   stochasticity? What type of density response will evolve, a strong
   threshold type response or a soft response gradually increasing
   dispersal?
   Method: An individual-based model including density dependence,
   environmental fluctuations, and population variation was used to
   simulate evolution of dispersal behaviour.
   Key assumptions and variables: Individuals can assess the instantaneous
   difference between habitat densities and base their dispersal behaviour
   thereon. However, future density and thus future quality of a chosen
   habitat patch remain uncertain due to behavioural variation and density
   fluctuations. Local density regulation was given by the Beverton-Holt
   map, affected by stochastic environmental forcing. An individual's
   dispersal decision is a sigmoid function of the density ratio between
   patch densities. The half-saturation point and steepness of the
   dispersal reaction norm were allowed to evolve.
   Conclusions: Conditional dispersal evolves from a state of random
   behaviour, yet we do not observe threshold dispersal as the evolutionary
   endpoint (as found in previous models). Among a heterogeneous set of
   dispersal strategies, the most successful respond softly to density
   differences but require a large density advantage to trigger emigration.
   Although threshold dispersal might be evolutionarily stable, we propose
   that such an endpoint may not be attainable if the evolutionary
   trajectory becomes less affected by selection and more by drift. The
   variability in dispersal behaviour within populations leads to
   unpredictability in the potential benefit of dispersal and hence may
   select for conservative emigration criteria. Other evolving life-history
   traits, such as phenological traits, subject to density- and
   frequency-dependent effects may show similar evolutionary patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The vertical sea temperature (VST) in the 0-40 in depth range for bigeye
   tuna (Thunnus obesus) inhabitation affects production of the spawning
   eggs. We then incorporate this VST along with regime shift into the
   original Ricker spawner-recruit (SR) model with two extended methods,
   i.e., the regime SR model and the fuzzy logic SR model. The three models
   are compared and evaluated using the bigeye tuna (T. obesus) SR data in
   the Indian Ocean from 1960 to 2001 obtained from the age-specific
   production model analyses.
   In the preliminary data analyses, we searched the specific range of the
   VST in 0-40m that would increase activities of spawners. Spawners are
   defined as the female fish with the gonad index (GI) > 3.1. Available
   gonad and depth-specific sea temperature data were used for the
   analyses. As a result, it was found that the higher average VST values
   in the 27.5-30.5 degrees C range produced higher GI values. Using its
   mean of 28.43 degrees C as a threshold value, we classified the SR data
   into two temperature regimes (cool or warm). Then, we applied the bigeye
   tuna SR data to three models. Based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC)
   and T 2 (correlation coefficient) values, it was resulted that the best
   model was the fuzzy, then the regime and the traditional Ricker model as
   the last.
   One of the essential problems discovered in the SR model analyses is
   that the time series of the SR data frequently followed the trajectories
   of the loops or the spirals instead of the original SR model curve. Such
   phenomena implied that the SR data made only apparent fitness to the SR
   model in many cases because the SR data could not actually satisfy the
   assumptions behind (the density-dependent process under the same
   environmental conditions). In our study, such loop was also observed in
   the original SR data, but after separated into two regimes, the loops
   were almost disappeared in each regime. This concluded that the bigeye
   tuna SR data in the Indian Ocean followed the density-dependent process
   in each homogenous environment (cool or warm regime) and the Fuzzy logic
   incorporating these two regimes was considered to the most appropriate
   method. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The District of Columbia (DC) Department of Health, under a
   grant from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
   established an Environmental Public Health Tracking Program. As part of
   this program, the goals of this contextual pilot study are to quantify
   short-term associations between daily pediatric emergency department
   (ED) visits and admissions for asthma exacerbations with ozone and
   particulate concentrations, and broader associations with socioeconomic
   status and age group.
   Methods: Data included daily counts of de-identified asthma-related
   pediatric ED visits for DC residents and daily ozone and particulate
   concentrations during 2001 - 2004. Daily temperature, mold, and pollen
   measurements were also obtained. After a cubic spline was applied to
   control for long-term seasonal trends in the ED data, a Poisson
   regression analysis was applied to the time series of daily counts for
   selected age groups.
   Results: Associations between pediatric asthma ED visits and outdoor
   ozone concentrations were significant and strongest for the 5 - 12
   year-old age group, for which a 0.01-ppm increase in ozone concentration
   indicated a mean 3.2\% increase in daily ED visits and a mean 8.3\%
   increase in daily ED admissions. However, the 1 - 4 yr old age group had
   the highest rate of asthma-related ED visits. For 1 - 17 yr olds, the
   rates of both asthma-related ED visits and admissions increased
   logarithmically with the percentage of children living below the poverty
   threshold, slowing when this percentage exceeded 30\%.
   Conclusion: Significant associations were found between ozone
   concentrations and asthm-arelated ED visits, especially for 5 - 12 year
   olds. The result that the most significant ozone associations were not
   seen in the age group (1 - 4 yrs) with the highest rate of
   asthma-related ED visits may be related to the clinical difficulty in
   accurately diagnosing asthma among this age group. We observed real
   increases in relative risk of asthma ED visits for children living in
   higher poverty zip codes versus other zip codes, as well as similar
   logarithmic relationships for visits and admissions, which implies ED
   over-utilization may not be a factor. These results could suggest
   designs for future epidemiological studies that include more information
   on individual exposures and other risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental processes frequently exhibit threshold-type behavior, e.
   g., the initiation of fluxes such as snowmelt, recharge, and quick flow.
   Incorporating such thresholds into hydrological models introduces
   discontinuities into the objective functions used in model calibration,
   making parameter estimation unnecessarily more difficult. Moreover, this
   study shows that model thresholds can produce spurious multimodality in
   least squares objective functions even if the underlying model is near
   linear in its parameters. In contrast, smoothing the model with respect
   to its parameters and inputs yields differentiable objective functions
   and, in some cases, can also improve its macroscale characteristics by
   removing spurious secondary optima. This simplifies model calibration
   and sensitivity analysis by reducing the complexity of objective
   functions and permitting the use of powerful derivative-based analysis
   methods such as Newton-type optimization and Hessian-based uncertainty
   assessment. This paper details smoothing strategies for several classes
   of thresholds and discontinuities commonly found in hydrological models,
   including step and angle discontinuities in the constitutive functions
   and flux constraints arising from conservation laws in the governing
   differential equations. The smoothing algorithms and their parameters
   are selected to ensure infinite differentiability of the model and its
   objective functions while preserving the macroscale behavior of the
   original governing equations. The improvements in the structure of the
   model and its objective functions are illustrated empirically for a
   degree-day-based snow model. The smoothing techniques are general and
   can be applied to other models with thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the effects of using a segmentation method to
   identify change-points or edges in vegetation. it identifies coherence
   (spatial or temporal) in place of unconstrained clustering. The
   segmentation method involves change-point detection along a sequence of
   observations so that each cluster formed is composed of adjacent
   samples; this is a form of constrained clustering. The protocol
   identifies one or more models, one for each section identified, and the
   quality of each is assessed using a minimum message length criterion,
   which provides a rational basis for selecting an appropriate model.
   Although the segmentation is less efficient than clustering, it does
   provide other information because it incorporates textural similarity as
   well as homogeneity. In addition it can be useful in determining various
   scales of variation that may apply to the data, providing a general
   method of small-scale pattern analysis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {{Aim Spatial patterns of phylogenetic diversity (PD) aid our ability to
   discern diversification rate mechanisms underlying hypotheses for the
   large-scale distribution of biodiversity. We develop a predictive
   framework for the way in which spatial patterns of PD vary with those of
   species richness, depending on the balance between speciation and
   extinction rates. Within this framework, diversification processes
   thought to underlie the productive energy, ambient energy, topographic
   variability and habitat variety hypotheses predict that gradients of
   increase in species richness will be associated with: (1) decreasing
   extinction rates where driven by productive energy, hence increasing
   relative PD (i.e. PD controlling for species richness, or PDrel); (2) a
   similar positive relationship between ambient energy and PDrel; (3)
   increasing speciation rates where driven by topographic variability,
   hence decreasing PDrel; and (4) no consistent relationship between PDrel
   and habitat variety when driven by the latter. We test these predictions
   using distributional data on parrots.
   Location Neotropical, Afrotropical, Indo-Malayan and Australasian
   realms.
   Methods Spatial models were used to test the predictions.
   Results Globally, a positive association between productive energy and
   PDrel confirms prediction (1). However, within realms, hump-shaped
   relationships suggest the importance of decreasing extinction rates up
   to a threshold level of productive energy, and the increasing importance
   of speciation rates thereafter. Ambient energy is positively associated
   with PDrel in Australasia, Indo-Malaya, and globally, supporting
   prediction (2). However, this is driven by the coincidence of highest
   PDrel in areas of high ambient energy and intermediate productive energy
   (i.e. in seasonal tropical environments), which may be characterized by
   relatively low speciation and extinction rates. In the Neotropics,
   increasing topographic variability is associated with decreasing PDrel
   and increasing species richness, suggesting an increasing gradient of
   speciation, supporting prediction (3). Elsewhere, the signal of this
   mechanism may be obscured by collinearities with energy gradients. The
   lack of an overall relationship between habitat diversity and PDrel
   confirms prediction (4).
   Main conclusions Spatial patterns of PDrel in relation to environmental
   gradients may be sensitive to collinearities among those gradients.
   Nevertheless, patterns emerge which have implications for the relative
   importance of speciation and extinction processes in generating
   latitudinal diversity gradients.}},

Abstract = {{Many populations have a negative impact on their habitat, or upon other
   species in the environment, if their numbers become too large. For this
   reason they are often managed using some form of control. The objective
   is to keep numbers at a sustainable level, while ensuring survival of
   the population. Here we present models that allow population management
   programs to be assessed. Two common control regimes will be considered:
   reduction and suppression. Under the suppression regime the population
   is maintained close to a particular threshold through near continuous
   control, while under the reduction regime, control begins once the
   population reaches a certain threshold and continues until it falls
   below a lower pre-defined level. We discuss how to best choose the
   control parameters, and we provide tools that allow population managers
   to select reduction levels and control rates. Additional tools will be
   provided to assess the effect of different control regimes, in terms of
   population persistence and cost. In particular we consider the effects
   of each regime on the probability of extinction and the expected time to
   extinction, and compare the control methods in terms of the expected
   total cost of each regime over the life of the population. The
   usefulness of our results will be illustrated with reference to the

Abstract = {{Delaware's Inland Bays comprise a large estuarine system with a
   restricted access to the Atlantic Ocean (Indian River Inlet). As part of
   a local oyster stock enhancement and restoration effort, we conducted a
   survey for the protozoan pathogen Perkinsus marinus (Dermo) in oysters
   from a newly established reef. Using standardized methods for the
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the non-transcribed
   spacer (NTS) region, we were surprised to find no detectable titers of
   this pathogen in the 30 oysters sampled in the first year of the
   project. The detection threshold of the PCR coupled with
   chemiluminescent detection was 30 fg P. marinus NTS DNA. We were able to
   detect a trace presence of this pathogen in a few hard clams (Mercenaria
   mercenaria) from the same locale, indicating that a Perkinsus sp. was
   present in the Inland Bay system. Subsequent monitoring of the reef
   system using a fluid thioglycollate assay over 3 yr revealed no
   epizootic outbreaks of this pathogen within the planted oyster
   population. Two large mortality episodes that did appear in the oyster
   population were attributable to abiotic conditions and not pathogen
   exposure. This study emphasizes that all potential sources of mortality
   in the environment are important to consider when designing oyster
   seeding projects. In the Delaware Inland Bays, P. marinus does not
   appear to have a large enough oyster host population to become a
   significant disease threat at present. Because of the low parasite
   incidence levels in the Inland Bay system in 2000, the James Farm oyster
   reef restoration project presents an ideal model system to follow the
   population dynamics between an oyster-host population and a latent or

Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{325-340}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Question: Are seed mass and shape related to persistence in the soil
   seed bank among 54 species of the Israeli flora?
   Search method: Persistence was determined by soil seed bank
   investigations in which the fraction of non-germinated viable seeds was
   regarded as the persistent soil seed bank. When seedling emergence had
   ceased but before new seeds were shed, all soil from the upper 5 cm of
   120 quadrats was removed to the laboratory. At that time, the seeds
   sampled were those from previous seed rains.
   Data description: Plant species with persistent and transient seeds were
   widely scattered across the range of seed mass or dimension and
   variances. A significant relationship was found between seed mass (or
   dimension) and seed persistence with persistent seeds tending to have
   larger mass. However, no significant relationship was found between seed
   shape and seed persistence. Species with persistent seeds had
   significantly higher seed mass than those with transient seeds
   (one-tailed t-test = 1.68, n = 48, P = 0.007), but there was no
   significant difference in shape between them (one-tailed t-test = 1.68,
   n = 48, P = 0.076; t-test = 1.68, n = 45, P = 0.124). Species with
   persistent seeds yielded significantly higher seed dimensions than those
   with transient seeds (one-tailed t-test = 1.95, n = 48, P = 0.029). In
   this study, there was no threshold in seed mass (or dimension) and shape
   that distinguished transient from persistent seeds.
   Conclusions: Species with persistent seeds have significantly larger
   seeds than species with transient seeds. However, species with small
   and/or round persistent seeds were relatively common. The underlying
   mechanism proposed for the observed pattern is a high proportion of
   large-seeded, persistent species with hard seed coat dormancy and
   abundant litter on the surface of the soil. Data from all eight floras
   studied to date suggest that significant differences in climate may
   determine diverse patterns in the relationships between seed mass and
   shape and persistence. Small and compact seeds are likely to occur in
   soil seed banks in humid climates, whereas large-seeded species with
   persistent seed banks are more likely to be abundant in arid climates.
   In addition, the importance of the spatial scale of investigations (or
   the range of habitats) is emphasized for studying the relationships
   between seed mass and shape and persistence.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional approaches to pollution prevention in South American
   countries have traditionally relied on scientists identifying
   potentially harmful substances and practices, and advising regulators
   concerning exposures and effects. Since the 1990s scientific knowledge
   and skills have contributed to the creation of pollution control
   legislation. However the extent, to which the legislation is effectively
   applied, is determined by government policies. To be effective,
   strategies for environmental protection must be firmly supported by
   political commitment. Sediment is recognized worldwide as a major
   repository for persistent contaminants in aquatic ecosystems.
   Contaminant dynamics promote changes in the overlying water quality, as
   well as in porewater and can affect the biota even though the overlying
   water may meet water quality criteria. It is recognized that traditional
   water quality-based controls are not enough to protect the aquatic
   environments in which sediment quality assessment is also required.
   Although chemical analysis of sediment provides information, which may
   allow for the estimation of potential biological effects, contaminant
   concentrations are not accurate predictors of biological responses.
   Sediment Quality Values can only be derived from a database of
   biological effects verfied for different organisms by a variety of
   methods that show the relationship between effects and contaminants.
   Given the difficulties in establishing this database, Brazil, like other
   countries in South America, still does not have Sediment Quality
   Criteria (SQC) despite the existence of quality criteria for water
   Although effluents are often controlled according to normalized
   standards, high levels of contamination in reservoirs, rivers, estuaries
   and coastal areas have been found; consequently sediments are receiving
   greater attention in South America. The principles and techniques
   globally accepted for sediment toxicity assessment are already in use in
   many South American countries, in an attempt to solve localized problems
   of environmental contamination. Most of the countries have chosen local
   test-species according to required criteria, and have already
   standardized protocols to establish the relationship between
   contamination and toxicity. Several integrative approaches for sediment
   quality evaluation such as; Apparent Effects Threshold (AET),
   Equilibrium Partitioning (EqP) and Sediment Quality Triad (SQT) are also
   being applied to hotspots to promote political measures for conservation
   and remediation.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades, the size at which Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus
   spp. attains maturity has decreased in many populations, whereas the age
   at maturity has increased. Both fisheries-induced evolution and
   environmentally-induced phenotypic plasticity could contribute to the
   changing age and size at maturity of Pacific salmon. We evaluated the
   potential for genetic changes in the maturation schedule of Japanese
   chum salmon using the probabilistic maturation reaction norm (PMRN)
   method. We found that the recent decrease in size at maturity, and
   increase in age at maturity, of Japanese chum salmon can be largely
   attributed to a phenotypic response to a reduced growth rate, but that
   fisheries-induced evolution should not be ruled out. Recent claims
   concerning fisheries-induced evolution of the maturation schedule are
   based on the decline in the age-specific body size at which the
   probability of maturing is 50\%, a feature of PMRNs. However, the PMRN
   could change with changing environmental conditions. Therefore, a
   genetic change cannot be diagnosed only by the PMRN method.}},

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory flume experiments were carried out, to measure the effect of
   biota on erodibility of mudflat sediments. The experiments sought to
   reproduce the environment of the lower mudflat at Hythe, Southampton
   Water, Southern England; this is characterised by fine grain-size and a
   surface layer of very fluid mud. Natural sediments were used to produce
   settled beds in the Lab Carousel, an annular flume of 2 m diameter. The
   following bed conditions were investigated diatom biofilms; the addition
   of cockles (Cerastoderma edule); and abiotic sediment, obtained by the
   addition of sodium hypochlorite. The erosion threshold (tau(crit),
   calculated with the TKE method) was in the range 0.02-0.20 Pa.
   Bioconsolidation increased tau(crit) considerably: compared to the
   abiotic sediment experiment, tau(crit) was 5-10 times higher depending
   on the biofilm development. The relationship between tau(crit) and water
   content of sediment (the best proxy for sediment compaction) was as
   good, or better than between tau(crit) and chlorophyll a (proxy for
   biofilm development). When cockles were introduced, tau(crit) was
   significantly lower (reduction by 50-75\% compared with the diatom
   biofilm experiments), reflecting the surface disturbance by the
   bivalves. The biofilm erosion was characterised by a patchy pattern: the
   bed surface stayed mainly uneroded and erosion was visible only on a few
   elongated patches commencing at some weakness points of the biofilm,
   then progressing downstream. The results illustrate the importance of
   the surface heterogeneity: the irregularities of a natural bed (weak
   points of the biofilm, bioturbations, microrelief, larger roughness
   elements like shells or algae, etc.) have a determinant effect on the
   erodibility of biofilms. Such characteristics may have more influence
   than biofilm strength, because the erosion starts from the weaker areas.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and quantifying the behaviour of extreme wind speeds has
   important applications for design in civil engineering. As in the
   extremal analysis of any environmental process, estimates are often
   required of the probability of events that are rarer than those already
   recorded. Consequently, research has focused on the development of
   techniques that make optimal use of the available data. One such
   approach lies in threshold methods, which, unlike the more traditional
   annual maxima approach to the modelling of extremes, takes into
   consideration all extreme events, extreme in the sense that they exceed
   some high threshold. However, the implications of using all extremes in
   an analysis include problems of temporal dependence and
   non-stationarity. Several pragmatic ways of circumventing the problem of
   temporal dependence have been developed, though these often include the
   deletion of many extreme observations, for example, filter out a set of
   independent extremes. This paper looks at another approach to
   inference-one which explicitly models the temporal dependence of the
   process and so can use information on all extremes-and investigates the
   appropriateness of assumptions of short-term temporal dependence for
   wind speeds. We also examine the success of such methods at estimating
   some extreme events commonly studied for wind-speed data. Throughout
   this paper extreme wind speeds are analysed within a Bayesian framework,
   which can be argued to be particularly advantageous for extreme value
   analyses. For example, the objective of an extreme value analysis is
   usually an estimate of the probability of future events reaching extreme
   levels-something which is handled quite naturally in a Bayesian analysis
   through predictive distributions. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The presence of byssinosis, an occupational disease found among cotton
   mill workers, has been well documented in different parts of the world.
   The disease develops due to exposure to environmental cotton dust.
   Evidence suggests that the causative agent for the disease is
   gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and their endotoxins present on the cotton
   fibers. An investigation was carried out in a gin house in western
   India. Environmental dust samples were collected by vertical elutriator
   (VE). Airborne dust concentrations were very high in the working
   environment: 2.11 mg/m(3) in ginning and 0.95 mg/m(3) in the press
   department (p < 0.05), which was higher than the threshold limit value
   collected by VE (0.2 mg/m(3)), and higher than the permissible exposure
   limit for respirable dust (0.5 mg/m(3) for nontextile industries using
   cotton). In the office control site, the dust concentration was 0.31
   mg/m(3). The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's cotton dust
   standard permissible exposure limit for respirable dust is 0.2 mg/m(3)
   in yarn manufacturing, 0.75 mg/m(3) in slashing and weaving, and 0.5
   mg/m(3) in nontextile industries using cotton. These samples also showed
   high concentrations of airborne endotoxin (p < 0.001) in ginning and
   pressing (2.77 and 1.52 mu g/m(3)) compared with the office control site
   (0.009 mu g/m(3) measured by Limulus amoebocyte lysate technique). Total
   enumeration of airborne GNB was carried out qualitatively by the petri
   plate exposure method and quantitatively by an Andersen 6-stage viable
   sampler and VE. GNB were recovered in quite high numbers. Among all the
   GNB, Enterobacter agglomerans were the dominant bacterial flora. Results
   indicate that gin workers are occupationally exposed to airborne GNB and
   endotoxins, and require masks.}},

Abstract = {{Question: What is the relationship between soil fertility and plant
   species richness in the `fertile islands' occurring beneath two species
   of legume (Cercidium praecox and Prosopis laevigata)?
   Location: Tehuacan-Cuicatlan region, central Mexico.
   Methods: Plant richness was measured in three micro-environments (below
   canopies of C. praecox, below canopies of P. laevigata and in areas
   without canopies). The concentration of soil nutrients (C, N and P), C
   and N in the microbiota, and processes of ecosystem functioning (net C
   mineralization rate and N mineralization) were measured. The
   relationship between soil variables and plant richness were assessed
   with ANCOVAs.
   Results: Soil nutrients and species richness increases markedly under
   fertility islands. There were higher concentrations of C and N in the
   soil, faster rates of C mineralization, and higher species richness
   under P laevigata canopies. The relationship between soil fertility and
   species richness was always positive except for total N, ammonium and
   net C mineralization rate under C. praecox, and for available P under P.
   laevigata.
   Conclusions: The sign of the relationship between soil fertility and
   species richness varies according to the nutrient and the
   micro-environment. Positive relationships could result from between
   species complementarity and facilitation. Negative relationships could
   be explained by a specific limitation threshold for some soil resources
   (P and N for plants and C for the soil rnicrobiota) which eliminate the
   possibilities of between species complementarity and facilitation above
   that threshold. As in all observational Studies, these relationships
   should be considered only correlational.}},

Abstract = {{Models predicting species spatial distribution are increasingly applied
   to wildlife management issues, emphasising the need for reliable methods
   to evaluate the accuracy of their predictions. As many available
   datasets (e.g. museums, herbariums, atlas) do not provide reliable
   information about species absences, several presence-only based analyses
   have been developed. However, methods to evaluate the accuracy of their
   predictions are few and have never been validated. The aim of this paper
   is to compare existing and new presenceonly evaluators to usual
   presence/absence measures.
   We use a reliable, diverse, presence/absence dataset of 114 plant
   species to test how common presence/absence indices (Kappa, MaxKappa,
   AUC, adjusted D-2) compare to presenceonly measures (AVI, CVI, Boyce
   index) for evaluating generalised linear models (GLM). Moreover we
   propose a new, threshold-independent evaluator, which we call
   ``continuous Boyce index{''}. All indices were implemented in the
   B10MAPPER software.
   We show that the presence-only evaluators are fairly correlated (p >
   0.7) to the presence/absence ones. The Boyce indices are closer to AUC
   than to MaxKappa and are fairly insensitive to species prevalence. In
   addition, the Boyce indices provide predicted-toexpected ratio curves
   that offer further insights into the model quality: robustness, habitat
   suitability resolution and deviation from randomness. This information
   helps reclassifying predicted maps into meaningful habitat suitability
   classes. The continuous Boyce index is thus both a complement to usual
   evaluation of presence/absence models and a reliable measure of
   presence-only based predictions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {{The Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) has been calculated for
   many countries, but rarely at the local level. This paper shows how the
   index has been calculated for the Province of Siena, Central Italy. The
   whole procedure is illustrated step by step, including the search for
   the most suitable and precise methods to obtain reliable values for each
   item composing the index. Application of ISEW at a very local level was
   found to be feasible. The most general difficulty encountered was the
   lack of an adequate institutionalised source of statistical information
   to support the construction of indicators other than purely economic or
   demographic ones. This is mainly due to the still low interest for a
   sustainable management of natural resources and land on the part of
   local authorities, and the related willingness to invest money and human
   resources on environmental research. The ISEW gives a more realistic
   representation of the well-being of the population than GDP, since it
   includes environmental and social items not considered in conventional
   national accounting. Furthermore, in Italy, the principle of
   administrative decentralization has been implemented in recent years to
   such an extent that the central government devolved part of its power to
   Regions, Provinces and Municipalities. Consequently, local authorities
   are called to allocate more resources to pursue their policies towards
   sustainability, an issue which modem electoral campaigns are often based
   on. The results for the Province of Siena show that there is a large gap
   between local GDP and ISEW (about 37\% of GDP). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Aim Using a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM), we assessed the
   independent and co-varying effects of temperature, precipitation and
   atmospheric CO2 on nonlinear (threshold) responses in carbon-based
   processes, and evaluated whether these underlying process thresholds
   translate to the ecosystem-scale.
   Location Amazon Basin, South America.
   Methods The Lund-Potsdam-Jena model (LPJ) was employed to determine
   responses in net primary production (NPP), heterotrophic respiration
   (R-H), vegetation carbon (C-V), soil carbon (C-S), and plant functional
   type (PFT) composition to variations in temperature (+/- 9 degrees C
   relative to the control), precipitation (up to 80\% reduction in
   rainfall relative to the control) and atmospheric CO2 (+/- 100 p. p. m.
   v. relative to the control).
   Results Our modelling experiments show that increases in temperature
   result in lower and steeper NPP and R-H curves, indicating a thermal
   threshold at current temperature conditions. Under a combination of
   temperature and precipitation change, C-V responds more to
   precipitation, while C-S closely follows temperature gradients.
   Ecosystem thresholds, measured in terms of PFT composition stability,
   are surprisingly few. Simulations indicate an ecosystem threshold
   occurring at 80\% reduction in rainfall; however, due to modelling
   limitations, this threshold is likely to occur at earlier drought stress
   conditions. Further empirical research on abiotic stress tolerance
   levels in tropical ecosystems must be performed in order to refine PFT
   descriptions used in DGVMs.
   Main conclusion In evaluating simulation scenarios that promote major
   changes in PFT assemblage, we conclude that the `natural' Amazonian rain
   forest is resilient to environmental change, particularly to decreases
   in temperature and precipitation. Determining to what extent
   anthropogenic pressures have altered this resiliency is of utmost
   importance in predicting the future fate of the Amazon Basin.}},

Abstract = {{The growing concern of the possible impact of natural disasters and
   extreme events on the environment has recently created new demands for
   information from, and assessment by, environmental engineers and
   climatologists. Mediterranean river basins encompass a diverse range of
   valley and floodplain environments and are affected by many different
   processes, such as hydroclimate, land-use, catchment geology, and
   relief. The objective of this paper is to develop a methodology for
   exploratory rainstorms data analysis and uncertainty estimation in
   regional hydrogeomorphological frequency analysis (HFA). A general
   framework is proposed for designing spatial variability of rainstorms
   with assigned return periods (T) inducing multiple damaging
   hydrogeomorphological events in the Campania region, south Italy. To
   this end, the analysis of precipitation, involving means techniques of
   regional HFA and geostatistical theory integrated approaches, is a
   subject of great interest. However, the hydrogeomorphological
   consequences depend on complex interactions between extreme
   precipitation and torrential characteristics of the landscape. In
   Mediterranean environments, climatic fluctuations in hydrological
   regime, especially those exceeding rain thresholds for an acceptable
   range of flexibility, can be the main causes of relevant
   hydrogeomorphological impacts. An algorithm for the characterization of
   this impact termed with the acronym DRHI (Design Rainstorms Hazard
   Index) in this paper is presented first. Next, the continuous DRHI data
   are converted at each location using a binary variable indicator
   transform based on critical thresholds. In the third step, the expansion
   of DRHI-soft information from point to landscapes were assessed
   geostatistically using the records of 70 rain stations of the Department
   of Civil Protection established by Regional Monitoring Networks. In this
   way, threshold values for extreme hydrogeomorphological impacts were
   selected based on geographical distribution patterns of precipitation
   maxima with a duration of 3 h for a return period of 10, 20, and 50
   years. Moreover, the map-based method provides the identification where
   future infill sampling should be focused in support of more precise
   characterization.}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{201-207}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background, Aims, Scope. A number of biotests are available for the
   characterisation of solid matters such as soil or sediment. Among these,
   bacterial biotests using single test species often analyse the toxicity
   of water-soluble contaminants in aquatic extracts, but there is also a
   need for a fast and inexpensive bacterial solid-contact test. In this
   study, a solid contact test with added bacteria (Arthrobacter
   globiformis) was optimised (through miniaturization) for the development
   of a test kit with conserved bacteria. As in other tests, the results
   can be influenced by natural soil factors, often masking anthropogenic
   impacts. For this reason, a further goal of this study was the
   investigation of the influence of natural soil characteristics on the
   result of the solid contact test. The project is part of the joint
   research project `Optimization of ecotoxicological test methods for
   routine use' (abbreviated as `ERNTE'-Forschungsvorhaben: 0330305).
   Method. This method is based on an existing German standard (DIN 38412 L
   48) using Artbrobacter globiformi for testing whole soils and sediments.
   The test principle is the measurement of the dehydrogenase activity of
   the test organism A. globiformis after an incubation time of two hours
   with the solid material. To attain the miniaturization in microplates,
   dye measurement was changed from spectrophotometrical determination of
   the substrate resazurine to the fluorimetric measurement of the product
   resorufin. A second step towards optimisation was the use of
   freeze-dried bacteria. Seven selected uncontaminated soils were tested
   in order to determine the influence of natural soil characteristics on
   the results of the solid contact test with A. globiformis. Freshly
   spiked and polluted field soils were analysed in order to obtain
   information about the sensitivity of the test.
   Results. It is possible to perform the contact test in microplates. The
   fluorimetric dye measurement can be carried out in the presence of the
   solid material, so the work-intensive step of centrifugation and
   filtration is no longer necessary. The measurement in the optimised
   contact test is based on the kinetics of the enzyme reaction. The
   investigation showed that conserved bacteria have the same activity and
   sensitivity as cultivated bacteria.
   Discussion. The study of the uncontaminated soils demonstrated the
   influence of various soil characteristics on the results of the solid
   contact test. This information is the basis for the selection of the
   control and reference soils and is crucial for setting the threshold
   value in toxicity testing. The investigation of freshly spiked and
   contaminated soils showed a different sensitivity dependent on the kind
   of the contamination.
   Conclusions. The solid contact test was successfully optimised using
   microplates, whereas now less than six hours are necessary for the
   analysis. The optimised test is rapid and sensitive, requiring small
   samples and no stock culture of the bacteria A. globiformis if using
   freeze-dried bacteria. In this study, the effect of natural soil factors
   such as pH-value was shown. This information is used to define the
   threshold value for toxicity. Therefore, the optimised contact test can
   be used for an efficient assessment of soil or soil substrates. Further
   studies will clear up if this optimisation is also valid for aquatic
   sediments and waste.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. Due to its short analysis time, the
   test is suitable for screening different kinds of solid matter and can
   be used for on-site analysis. The optimised contact test with
   freeze-dried bacteria as part of a battery of tests is appropriate for
   the assessment of contaminated soils, sediments and waste.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Computational requirements often limit the assessment of uncertainty in
   complex environmental models. Monte Carlo-based techniques such as
   generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) and Bayesian
   uncertainty assessment are limited in applicability because of their
   heavy computational demands. This paper presents a computationally
   efficient method that combines automatic calibration using
   function-approximation-based global optimization with importance
   weighting for assessing parametric uncertainty in model outputs for
   computationally expensive models. We call this method automatic
   calibration and uncertainty assessment using response surfaces (ACUARS).
   The bias introduced during optimization because of oversampling of high
   goodness of fit regions of the parameter space is corrected using a
   multidimensional cell-declustering technique. The proposed method is
   applied to two hypothetical examples in enhanced bioremediation of
   chlorinated ethenes in groundwater that differ in computational
   requirements and the number of parameters that were calibrated. The
   results from the simpler example in which uncertainty of three model
   parameters in model outputs was considered showed that for a given
   acceptability threshold and a given number of permissible model
   simulations, ACUARS finds many more representative parameter sets than
   GLUE. GLUE produced only half the number of acceptable parameter sets
   for uncertainty assessment, even after 10 times as many simulations as
   ACUARS was performed for GLUE. Further, the median output of ACUARS
   predicted the true value of the outputs more closely than GLUE. For a
   more complicated numerical example, where noisy data were used for
   calibration of seven model parameters, GLUE required 2400 simulations to
   find 31 acceptable parameter sets, while ACUARS found 46 acceptable
   parameter sets in only 300 simulations for a moderately stringent
   threshold. This enabled a more accurate estimate of uncertainty by
   providing closer estimates of the true outputs.}},

Abstract = {{Climate can have complex effects on demographic rates and the endogenous
   feedback structure regulating mammal populations, and this can create
   problems for predictive modelling. In northern and Alpine environments,
   weather appears to influence ungulate population growth rates mainly
   during years of high population density, suggesting the possibility of
   nonlinear interactions between the 2 variables. Threshold models have
   been employed to account for these nonlinearities. For example, in the
   case of Alpine ibex Capra ibex in the Gran Paradiso National Park of
   Italy, stronger density dependence is assumed to occur after snowfall
   exceeds 1.54 m. In this paper we use more objective nonparametric
   methods to evaluate the form of the functional relationships governing
   the dynamics of this ibex population. No evidence was found for a
   threshold effect in the data. Instead we uncovered a non-additive and
   nonlinear interaction between climate and population density. The
   resulting models predict ibex numbers as well or better than previous
   threshold models despite requiring fewer parameters, and also conform
   well to traditional ecological concepts. We conclude with several
   lessons for those who wish to predict the effects of climate change on

Abstract = {{A large-scale, strategic-level method has been developed to facilitate
   dialogue with policymakers on future coastal land-use management, in the
   context of climate change and the implications of sea-level rise for

   explored through their influence on patterns of flooding and consequent
   landscape change. The method is based upon a series of transition rules
   linking frequency of inundation by the sea to changes in land use and
   land cover at key threshold values. A high-resolution digital elevation
   model derived from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR)
   provides the topographic information required for relating sea-level
   rise to tidal and flood frequency limits. The rule-based approach allows
   a rapid evaluation of multiple policy options and critical assumptions
   can be made more transparent and responsive to end-users than with
   conventional modelling approaches. A case study example is provided from
   the North Norfolk coast in eastern England, where the results imply that

Title = {{Effect thresholds and `adequate control' of risks - The fatal flaws in
   the EU Council's position on authorisation within REACH}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{425-431}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background. Preparation of the new European REACH (Registration,
   Evaluation and Authorisation of CHemicals) regulation on chemicals has
   reached a critical stage. Depending on how key elements of the
   legislative proposal are finalised, especially that on authorisation of
   uses of `substances of very high concern', REACH could either provide an
   effective measure to drive innovation towards cleaner and safer
   alternatives, or instead lead to further avoidable chemical exposures on
   the basis of demonstrated `adequate control' of risks. Given that some
   key indicators of human and wildlife reproductive health continue to
   decline in parts of Europe, while evidence for chemical exposure as a
   contributory factor grows, it will clearly be vital to get the
   legislation right.
   Goal and Scope. Whereas there is now a consensus between the European
   Parliament and Council of the European Union that uses of persistent,
   bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) and very persistent and very
   bioaccumulative (vPvB) substances should only be permitted when no safer
   alternatives are available, major differences remain regarding the
   manner in which other `substances of very high concern' (including
   substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction
   (CMRs) and endocrine disruptors) are addressed. This paper examines
   those differences in more detail and proposes some ways forward.
   Methods. Using case studies of specific chemicals as examples, the paper
   critically evaluates the concepts of `effect thresholds' and `adequate
   control' of risks, which underpin the Council's proposal for many CMRs
   and endocrine disruptors.
   Results. The subjectivity and uncertainties inherent in the threshold
   approach proposed by the Council, as illustrated by these case examples,
   bring its ability to ensure a high level of protection for the
   environment and human health into question: i. the nature and extent of
   toxic effects recorded depend on many different factors, including the
   type of test and conditions selected, the organisms exposed, the timing
   of exposure and precisely which effects are measured and over what
   timeframe. ii. doses considerably below `no effect levels' for survival
   could nevertheless be causing significant impairment to health and/or
   reproductive success. iii. chemicals present in mixtures at levels below
   established thresholds for effects may, in combination, induce
   significant toxicological responses.
   Discussion. Under the Council's current proposal, companies will be
   granted authorisations for some uses of CMRs and endocrine disruptors,
   even if safer alternatives without these properties are already on the
   market. The high level of evidence required for identification of
   substances as being of equivalent concern represents an additional
   weakness in the Council approach.
   Conclusions. Instead, a requirement (along the lines of the Parliament's
   proposals) to address the availability of alternatives in all cases, to
   use them when available and to initiate their development when not,
   represents a more robust, defensible and protective approach to the
   management of `substances of very high concern'. The possibility for
   authorisation of essential uses would remain, while all avoidable uses
   and exposures would progressively be prevented and sustainable
   innovation supported.
   Perspectives. In the long run, this can only lead to a more sustainable
   future for the chemical industry in Europe, as well as delivering
   benefits of increased protection for our environment and health for
   generations to come.}},

Title = {{Effects of locally rare taxa on the precision and sensitivity of RIVPACS
   bioassessment of freshwaters}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1924-1940}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. An overall aim in freshwater bioassessment is to use biological
   methods, metrics and forms of indices which are precise, in that they
   give repeatable results between replicate samples, but which are also
   sensitive to changes in environmental impacts and stresses. Here we
   studied the effects of excluding taxa with site-specific River
   Invertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS)-type model
   expected probabilities less than (or equal to) a threshold P-t (0.0,
   0.1, 0.2,...,0.9) on the value, precision and power to detect biological
   effects of environmental stress using the observed to expected ratios
   (O/E) of biotic indices used to assess the ecological status of U.K.
   river sites.
   2. Amongst the 614 high quality GB RIVPACS reference sites, excluding
   taxa with low expected probabilities of occurrence gave less total
   variation (i.e. lower SD) in the estimates O/E for number of taxa
   (O/E-TAXA) and the average score per taxon (O/E-ASPT).
   3. A separate analysis of a replicated sampling study of sites from a
   wide range of physical types and qualities revealed that sampling
   variances in O/E for reference condition sites decreased as more locally
   rare taxa were excluded (but only up to P-t = 0.5 for O/E-ASPT).
   However, for moderately impacted and poor quality sites, estimates of
   both O/E-TAXA and O/E-ASPT based on all (P-t = 0.0) or most taxa (i.e.
   P-t <= 0.3) had lower sampling variances and were more precise.
   4. Within a very large independent set of test sites with a wide range
   of perceived levels of environmental stress, increasing the threshold
   P-t led to systematic compression of the realised O/E scale towards
   unity. Specifically, with increasing threshold, O/E values > 1 are on
   average reduced, while O/E values < 1 have a tendency to be higher and
   closer to unity (with the exception of O/E-ASPT for the most severely
   stressed sites).
   5. Accuracy and statistical power to detect environmental stress
   (measured by the percentage of stressed sites with O/E below the lower
   10-percentile value for reference sites) was very similar using O/E-TAXA
   for P-t up to 0.7. Using O/E-ASPT, power to detect overall general
   stress decreased slowly as P-t was increased; the rate of fall in power
   was slightly faster when restricted to sites subject to moderate or
   severe stress from organic inputs.
   6. Taxa which are more sensitive to (organic) stresses {[}i.e. have high
   Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) scores] tend to be naturally
   less widespread (i.e. amongst reference sites) and thus were found to
   have considerably lower average site-specific expected probabilities;
   this may explain why the use of higher thresholds P-t can exclude more
   such sensitive taxa and lead to underestimation of the extent of
   impacts.
   7. The standard U.K. RIVPACS sampling and sample processing procedures
   aim to identify all taxa within a sample. This may lead to a longer
   distribution tail of rarer (low probability) taxa than sampling methods
   based on a fixed count subsample and influence the practical effects of
   excluding rare taxa with low expected probabilities from bioassessments.}},

Title = {{Effect of sampling density on the measurement of stream condition
   indicators in two lowland Australian streams}},
Journal = {{RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{853-869}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{There is widespread application of indicators to the assessment of
   environmental condition of streams. These indicators are intended for
   use by managers in making various comparative and absolute assessments
   and often have a role in resource allocation and performance assessment.
   Therefore, the problem of formally defining confidence in the results is
   important but difficult because the sampling strategies used are
   commonly based on a compromise between the requirements of statistical
   rigour and the pragmatic issues of access and resources. It is rare to
   see this compromise explicitly considered and consequently there is
   seldom quantification of the uncertainty that could affect the
   confidence a manager has in an indicator.
   In this paper, we present a method for quantitatively assessing the
   tradeoffs between sampling density and uncertainty in meeting various
   monitoring objectives. Assessments using judgement-based representative
   reaches are shown to be unreliable; instead a sampling approach is
   recommended based on the random selection of measuring sites. A detailed
   dataset was collected along two streams in Victoria, Australia, and the
   effect of sampling density was assessed by subsampling from this dataset
   with precision related to the number of sites assessed per reach length
   and the intensity of the sampling at each site.
   The sampling scheme to achieve a given precision is shown to depend on
   the monitoring objective. In particular, three objectives were
   considered: (1) making a baseline assessment of current condition; (2)
   change detection; and (3) detection of a critical threshold in
   condition. Change detection is shown to be more demanding than assessing
   baseline condition with additional sampling effort required to achieve
   the same precision. Sampling to detect a critical threshold depends on
   nominating acceptable values of Type I and 11 error and the size of the
   effect to be detected. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Life cycle tools within Ford of Europe's Product Sustainability Index -
   Case study ford S-MAX \& Ford Galaxy}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{315-322}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Goal, Scope and Background. Sustainability is a well recognised goal
   which is difficult to manage due to its complexity. As part of a series
   of sustainability management tools, a Product Sustainability Index (PSI)
   is translating the sustainability aspects to the organization of vehicle
   product development of Ford of Europe, thus allocating ownership and
   responsibility to that function. PSI is limiting the scope to those key
   environmental, social and economic characteristics of passenger vehicles
   that are controllable by the product development organisation.
   Materials and Methods. The PSI considers environmental, economic and
   social aspects based on externally reviewed life cycle environmental and
   cost aspects (Life Cycle Assessment, Cost of ownership / Life Cycle
   Costing), externally certified aspects (allergy-tested interior) and
   related aspects as sustainable materials, safety, mobility capability
   and noise. After the kick-off of their product development in 2002, the
   new Ford S-MAX and Ford Galaxy are serving as a pilot for this tool.
   These products are launched in Europe in 2006. The tracking of PSI
   performance has been done by engineers of the Vehicle Integration
   department within the product development organization. The method has
   been translated in an easy spreadsheet tool. Engineers have been trained
   within one hour trainings. The application of PSI by vehicle integration
   followed the principle to reduce the need for any incremental time or
   additional data to a minimum. PSI is adopted to the existing
   decision-making process. End of 2005, an internal expert conducted a
   Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) study for
   verification purposes using commercial software. This study and the PSI
   have been scrutinized by an external review panel according to ISO 14040
   and, by taking into consideration the on-going SETAC, work in the field
   of LCC.
   Results. The results of the Life Cycle based indicators of PSI as
   calculated by non-experts are fully in line with those of the more
   detailed expert study. The difference is below 2\%. The new Ford Galaxy
   and Ford S-MAX shows significantly improved performance regarding the
   life cycle air quality, use of sustainable materials, restricted
   substances and safety compared to the previous model Galaxy. The
   affordability (Life Cycle Cost of Ownership) has also been improved when
   looking at the same engine types. Looking at gasoline versus diesel
   options, the detailed study shows under what conditions the diesel
   options are environmentally preferable and less costly (mileage, fuel
   prices, etc.).
   Discussion. The robustness of results has been verified in various ways.
   Based also on Sensitivity and Monte-Carlo Analysis, case study-specific
   requirements have been deduced defining criteria for a significant
   environmental improvement between the various vehicles. Only if the
   differences of LCIA results between two vehicles are larger than a
   certain threshold are the above-mentioned results robust. Conclusions.
   In general terms, an approach has been implemented and externally
   reviewed that allows non-experts to manage key environmental, social and
   economic aspects in the product development, also on a vehicle level.
   This allows mainstream functions to take ownership of sustainability and
   assigns accountability to those who can really decide on changes
   affecting the sustainability performance. In the case of Ford S-MAX and
   Galaxy, indicators from all three dimensions of sustainability
   (environment, social and economic) have been improved compared to the
   old Ford Galaxy.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. Based on this positive experience, it
   is recommended to make, in large or multinational organizations, the
   core business functions directly responsible and accountable for
   managing their own part of environmental, social and economic aspects of
   sustainability. Staff functions should be limited to starting the
   process with methodological and training support and making sure that
   the contributions of the different main functions fit together.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to compare the effects of different
   farming methods on bird communities. In particular, the study surveyed
   the frequency and number of bird species, the number of individuals and
   bird diversity (Shannon index) found in organic (o, non use of synthetic
   pesticides), integrated (i, reduced use of pesticides on the basis of
   the economic threshold) and conventional (c, conventional use of
   pesticides) orchards. A simplified version of the mapping method was
   applied, from May to June 1998, to 60 fruit farms (15o, 19 i, 26c), over
   a total of 483 ha. Twenty-six bird species were observed (19o, 17i,
   18c). Granivorous species were the most abundant and unaffected by
   pesticide management. Insectivorous species were less abundant in
   general, but more frequent on o and i farms (chi-square test, p < 0.05).
   Bird diversity was greater in o and i farm management than in c (Tukey
   test, respectively, p = 0.001 and 0.004). There was a non-significant
   trend for bird density to be higher in o/i than c orchards (ANOVA, F
   (2.57) = 2.76, p = 0.07). The results confirm the positive effects of
   (o) and (i) agriculture on bird communities, including some species of
   special interest for nature conservation. These effects could be
   attributed mostly to the different pest management and secondarily to
   some aspects of environmental differentiation (type of orchard, type of
   farm, age and height of trees, and increased presence of hedgerows and
   woodlots). Surprisingly no correlation was observed between hedgerows
   and woodlots and bird diversity (Pearson test, R = 0.0019).}},

Pages = {{367-375}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a simple genetic model is integrated with an established
   method from landscape ecology to investigate the effect of habitat
   geometry and availability on genetic drift. Previous ecological
   modelling has identified a sharp threshold in habitat availability for
   species' persistence, beyond which the species rapidly becomes extinct.
   This study demonstrates the existence of a similar threshold for
   fixation time of selectively neutral genotypes by genetic drift, the
   location of which is determined by habitat shape and spatial correlation
   of habitat loss. Time to fixation is greater for habitats if they are
   long and thin rather than square. Despite reductions in population size
   due to habitat loss, fixation time remains relatively constant until a
   pre-threshold value, beyond which there is often a substantial increase
   in time to fixation. Further habitat loss results in the percolation
   threshold being reached and beyond this point the time to fixation
   decreases very rapidly. This study reveals a complex relationship
   between habitat availability, habitat geometry and the process of
   genetic drift. Possible implications of our results for conservation are
   discussed. Further work is required to improve our understanding of the
   interaction between evolutionary, ecological and landscape processes.}},

Abstract = {{According to the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, economic
   growth and the reduction of environmental degradation are compatible

   increasing returns to pollution abatement, where the abatement

   fall as more abatement is undertaken. This study tests the hypothesis
   that there are increasing returns to abating pollution. Empirical

Abstract = {{Windblown dust can have significant impacts on local air pollution
   levels, and in cases such as dust from Africa or Asia, can have global
   impacts on our environment. Models to estimate particulate matter
   emissions from windblown dust are generally based on the local wind
   speed, the threshold wind speed to initiate erosion, and the soil
   texture of a given surface. However, precipitation, soil crusting, and
   soil disturbance can dramatically change the threshold wind speed and
   erosion potential of a surface, making modeling difficult. A low-cost
   sampling and analysis method was developed to account for these surface
   changes in a wind erosion model. Windblown dust emissions measured as
   PM10 (particulate matter less than a nominal 10 mu m aerodynamic
   diameter) have been found to be generally proportional to sand flux
   (also known as saltation flux). In this study, a model was used to
   estimate sand flux using the relationship Q = ApG/g, where Q is
   horizontal sand flux, A is a surface erosion potential factor, p is air
   density, g is the gravitational constant, and G = integral
   u({*})(u({*})(2) - u({*}t)(2)) dt, where u({*}) is friction velocity and
   u({*}t) is the threshold friction velocity of the surface. The variable
   A in the model was derived by comparing the measured sand flux for a
   given period and area to G for the same period. Sand flux was monitored
   at Owens Lake, CA using low-cost Cox Sand Catchers (CSCs) for monthly
   measurements, and more expensive electronic sensors (Sensits) to measure
   hourly flux rates and u({*}t). Monitors were spaced 1 km apart at 114
   sites, covering one clay and three sand-dominated soil areas. Good model
   results relied primarily on the erosion potential A, which could be
   determined from CSC measurements and wind speed data. Annual values for
   A were found to range from 1.3 to 3.5 in the three sand areas. The value
   of A was an order of magnitude lower (0.2) in the less erodible clay
   area. Previous studies showed similar values for A of 0.7 and 2.9 for a
   sandy site at Owens Lake, and 1.1 for a site in the Chihuahuan desert in
   New Mexico. The model performed well using annual values for A and
   better with monthly values, with R-2 ranging from 0.74 to 0.87 for
   hourly sand flux rates in the four study areas. Monthly changes in A
   accounted for temporal surface changes, such as precipitation and
   surface crusting in the model predictions. This study demonstrated that
   low-cost periodic sand flux sampling using CSCs can provide a practical
   method to determine values for A in a simple wind erosion model, and
   that this model can provide good hourly and monthly estimates of sand
   flux rates in windblown dust areas. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Rapid detection of toxic agents in the indoor environment is essential

   importance of a systems approach for properly evaluating such tradeoffs,
   using data from tracer gas experiments conducted in a three-floor
   building at the Dugway Proving Grounds, Utah. We explore how well a
   Bayesian interpretation approach can characterize an indoor release
   using threshold sensor data. We use this approach to assess the effects
   of various sensor characteristics, such as response time, threshold
   level, and accuracy, on overall system performance. The system
   performance is evaluated in terms of the time needed to characterize the

   Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) was quite toxic to enchytracids, with
   significant effects on reproduction detected already at the 10 mg kg(-1)
   exposure level (EC10 = 2.7 mg kg(-1)). In contrast, decabromodiphenyl
   ether (DeBDE) was not toxic at all, and short-chain chloroparaffins

Abstract = {{Recycling of construction and demolition waste contributes decisively to
   the saving of natural mineral resources. In Germany, processed mineral
   construction and demolition waste from structural engineering is used
   nearly exclusively in civil engineering (earthwork and road construction
   sector) as open-loop recycling. Due to the planned stricter limit values
   for the protection of soil and water, however, this recycling path in
   civil engineering may no longer be applicable in the future. According
   to some new guidelines and standards adopted recently, recycled
   aggregates may also be used for concrete production in the structural
   engineering sector (closed-loop recycling). Wastes from the structural
   engineering sector can thus be kept in a closed cycle, and their
   disposal on a landfill can be avoided. The present report focuses on the
   determination of maximum waste volumes that may be handled by this new
   recycling option. Potential adverse effects on the saving of resources
   and climate protection have been analysed. For this purpose, materials
   flow analysis and ecobalancing methods have been used.}},

Abstract = {{Phenological observations of flowering date, budding date or senescence
   provide very valuable time series. They hold out the prospect for
   relating plant growth to environmental and climatic factors and hence
   for engendering a better understanding of plant physiology under natural
   conditions. The statistical establishment of associations between time
   series of phenological data and climatic factors provides a means of
   aiding forecasts of the biological impacts of future climatic change.
   However, it must be kept in mind that plant growth and behaviour vary
   spatially as well as temporally. Environmental, climatic and genetic
   diversity can give rise to spatially structured variation on a range of
   scales. The variations extend from large-scale geographical (clinal)
   trends, through medium-scale population and sub-population fluctuations,
   to micro-scale differentiation among neighbouring plants, where
   spatially close individuals are found to be genetically more alike than
   those some distance apart. We developed spatio-temporal phenological
   models that allow observations from multiple locations to be analysed
   simultaneously. We applied the models to the first-flowering dates of
   Prunus padus and Tilia cordata from localities as far apart as Norway
   and the Caucasus. Our growing-degree-day approach yielded a good fit to
   the available phenological data and yet involved only a small number of
   model parameters. It indicated that plants should display different
   sensitivities to temperature change according to their geographical
   location and the time of year at which they flower. For spring-flowering
   plants, we found strong temperature sensitivities for islands and
   archipelagos with oceanic climates, and low sensitivities in the

Abstract = {{Aim, Scope and Background. The environmental and energy parameters of
   Photovoltaic systems play a very important role when compared to
   conventional power systems. In the present paper, a typical PV-system is
   analyzed to its elements and an assessment of the material and energy
   requirements during the production procedures is attempted. An LCA is
   being performed on the system of production of photovoltaics.
   Main Features. A complete and accurate identification and quantification
   of air emissions, water effluents, and other life-cycle outputs is
   performed. The emissions analysis is extended to the production of the
   primary energy carriers. This allows having a complete picture of the
   life cycle of all the PV-components described in the present study.
   Methods and Tools. In order to obtain concrete results from this study,
   the specific working tool used is the Eco-Indicator `95 as being
   reliable and has been widely applied within LCA community A process that
   relates inventory information with relevant concerns about natural
   resource usage and potential effects of environmental loadings is
   attempted.
   Conlusions. The analysis of all previous impact categories has shown
   that large-scale PV-systems have many advantages in comparison with a
   conventional power system (e.g. diesel power station) in electricity
   production. As a matter of fact, PV-systems become part of the
   environment and the ecosystems from the moment of their installation.
   Burdens are released from the PV-systems only during their manufacturing
   procedures.
   Recommendation. Technological improvements need to be done in the
   manufacture of BOS-components which consume during their life cycle
   almost equal amounts of energy as the photovoltaic modules.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Aim To propose a new approach to the small island effect (SIE) and a
   simple mathematical procedure for the estimation of its upper limit. The
   main feature of the SIE is that below an upper size threshold an
   increase of species number with increase of area in small islands is not
   observed.
   Location Species richness patterns from different taxa and insular
   systems are analysed.
   Methods Sixteen different data sets from 12 studies are analysed. Path
   analysis was used for the estimation of the upper limit of the SIE. We
   studied each data set in order to detect whether there was a certain
   island size under which the direct effects of area were eliminated. This
   detection was carried out through the sequential exclusion of islands
   from the largest to the smallest. For the cases where an SIE was
   detected, a log-log plot of species number against area is presented.
   The relationships between habitat diversity, species number and area are
   studied within the limits of the SIE. In previous studies only area was
   used for the detection of the SIE, whereas we also encompass habitat
   diversity, a parameter with well documented influence on species
   richness, especially at small scales.
   Results An SIE was detected in six out of the 16 studied cases. The
   upper limit of the SIE varies, depending on the characteristics of the
   taxon and the archipelago under study. In general, the values of the
   upper limit of the SIE calculated according to the approach undertaken
   in our study differ from the values calculated in previous studies.
   Main conclusions Although the classical species-area models have been
   used to estimate the upper limit of the SIE, we propose that the
   detection of this phenomenon should be undertaken independently from the
   species-area relationship, so that the net effects of area are
   calculated excluding the surrogate action of area on other variables,
   such as environmental heterogeneity. The SIE appears when and where area
   ceases to influence species richness directly. There are two distinct
   SIE patterns: (1) the classical SIE where both the direct and indirect
   effects of area are eliminated and (2) the cryptic SIE where area
   affects species richness indirectly. Our approach offers the opportunity
   of studying the different factors influencing biodiversity on small
   scales more accurately. The SIE cannot be considered a general pattern
   with fixed behaviour that can be described by the same model for
   different island groups and taxa. The SIE should be recognized as a
   genuine but idiosyncratic phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{There is an urgent need for the development and implementation of modern
   statistical methodology for long-term risk assessment of extreme
   hydrological hazards in the Caribbean. Notwithstanding the inevitable
   scarcity of data relating to extreme events, recent results and
   approaches call into question standard methods of estimation of the
   risks of environmental catastrophes that are currently adopted.
   Estimation of extreme hazards is often based on the Gumbel model and on
   crude methods for estimating predictive probabilities. In both cases the
   result is often a remarkable underestimation of the predicted
   probabilities for disasters of large magnitude. Simplifications do not
   stop here: assumptions of data homogeneity and temporal independence are
   usually made regardless of potential inconsistencies with genuine
   process behaviour and the fact that results may be sensitive to such
   mis-specifications. These issues are of particular relevance for the
   Caribbean, given its exposure to diverse meteorological climate
   conditions.
   In this article we present an examination of predictive methodologies
   for the assessment of long-term risks of hydrological hazards, with
   particular focus on applications to rainfall and flooding, motivated by
   three data sets from the Caribbean region. Consideration is given to
   classical and Bayesian methods of inference for annual maxima and daily
   peaks-over-threshold models. We also examine situations where data
   non-homogeneity is compromised by an unknown seasonal structure, and the
   situation in which the process under examination has a physical upper
   limit. We highlight the fact that standard Gumbel analyses routinely
   assign near-zero probability to subsequently observed disasters, and
   that for San Juan, Puerto Rico, standard 100-year predicted rainfall
   estimates may be routinely underestimated by a factor of two.}},

   limits and to determine the statistical values of DEHP concentrations in
   Japanese surface waters. The No-Observed-Effect-Concentration
   (NOECwater) of DEHP for aquatic life of 77 mu g/L was determined giving
   equal importance to both physical effects probably caused by undissolved
   DEHP and to the intrinsic toxicity potentially caused by DEHP. The
   NOECsediment of 615,000 mu g/kg was determined by the Equilibrium
   Partitioning (EqP) theory, conservatively assuming a threshold effect
   level in the water column as the water solubility of 3 mu g/L. The

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{64-71}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Goal, Scope and background. Methodologies based on life cycle assessment
   have been developed to calculate the environmental impact of dwellings.
   Human health damages due to exposure of occupants to substances and
   noise emitted by road traffic are not included in these methodologies.
   In this study, a methodology has been developed to calculate damages to
   human health of occupants caused by substances and noise emitted by
   neighbourhood car traffic. The goal of this study is to assess the
   influence of the location of the dwelling on the health of the
   occupants, compared to the damage to human health associated with the
   rest of the life cycle of that dwelling.
   Methods. Fate, exposure and human health effects were addressed in the
   calculation procedure. The methodology takes into account road traffic
   noise and four hazardous substances emitted by cars. Chemical fate
   factors were calculated with an outdoor exposure model for traffic
   pollutants, air entrance rates and indoor intake fractions. Fate factors
   for noise were based on noise levels generated by traffic. Effect
   factors for substances were based on unit risk factors and extrapolated
   dose-effect relationships. Effect factors for noise were based on linear
   relationships between noise level changes and health effects, while
   taking into account threshold values for noise levels for negative
   impacts. Damage factors were calculated on the basis of disability
   adjusted life years (DALYs). Human health damage scores for changes in
   traffic situations have been calculated for differences in three traffic
   scenarios in residential areas and for the Dutch reference dwellings.
   Results and Discussion. For the Dutch reference dwelling and the traffic
   situations considered and taking into account noise, particulate matter
   (PM10), sulphur dioxide, benzene and benzo{[}a]pyrene, communication
   disturbances and sleep disturbances due to noise and health effects of
   PM10 appear to be dominant in the total damage to human health of
   occupants caused by neighbourhood car traffic. A sensitivity analysis
   has shown that a reduction of the car and truck density and of the
   distance of the facade of the dwellings to the road axis has the largest
   positive effect on the human health of the occupants, and that a
   decrease of speed by traffic impediments has only a marginal or even a
   negative effect. Differences in overall indoor health damage due to
   different traffic scenarios may be 1.5 to 2 times higher than the total
   health damage associated with the dwelling life cycle.
   Conclusion. Within the limitations of this study, damages to human
   health of occupants due to indoor exposure to road traffic noise and
   pollutants appear to be in the same order of magnitude when compared
   with damages associated with the life cycle of dwellings. This
   emphasizes the importance to include the location of dwellings in the
   life cycle assessment of the dwelling.}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{72-80}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background, Aims and Scope. In the life cycle of a product, emissions
   take place at many different locations. The location of the source and
   its surrounding conditions influence the fate of the emitted pollutant
   and the subsequent exposure it causes. This source of variation is
   normally neglected in Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), although it
   is well known that the impacts predicted by site-generic LCIA in some
   cases differ significantly from the actual impacts. Environmental
   impacts of photochemical ozone (ground-level ozone) depend on parameters
   with a considerable geographical variability (like emission patterns and
   population densities). A spatially differentiated characterisation model
   thus seems relevant.
   Methods and Results. The European RAINS model is applied for calculation
   of site-dependent characterisation factors for Non-Methane Volatile
   Organic Compounds (NMVOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) for 41 countries or
   regions within Europe, and compatible characterisation factors for
   carbon monoxide (CO) are developed based on expert judgement. These
   factors are presented for three emission years (1990, 1995 and 2010),
   and they address human health impacts and vegetation impacts in two
   separate impacts categories, derived from AOT40 and AOT60 values
   respectively. Compatible site-generic chatacterisation factors for
   NMVOC, NOx, CO and methane (CH4) are calculated as emission-weighted
   European averages to be applied on emissions for which the location is
   unknown. The site-generic and site-dependent characterisation factors
   are part of the EDIP2003 LCIA methodology. The factors are applied in a
   specific case study, and it is demonstrated how the inclusion of spatial
   differentiation may alter the results of the photochemical ozone
   characterisation of life cycle impact assessment.
   Discussion and Conclusions. Compared to traditional midpoint
   characterisation modelling, this novel approach is spatially resolved
   and comprises a larger part of the cause-effect chain including exposure
   assessment and exceeding of threshold values. This positions it closer
   to endpoint modelling and makes the results easier to interpret. In
   addition, the developed model allows inclusion of the contributions from
   NO., which are neglected when applying the traditional approaches based
   on Photochemical Ozone Creation Potentials (POCPs). The variation in
   site-dependent characterisation factors is far larger than the variation
   in POCP factors. It thus seems more important to represent the spatially
   determined variation in exposure than the difference in POCP among the
   substances.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Do non-equilibrium (cycles or chaos) population dynamics
   chance evolutionary behaviour when compared with equilibrium dynamics?
   Mathematical methods: The theory of adaptive dynamics is applied to a
   discrete ecological model with an explicit trade-off between
   reproduction and survival. Simulation techniques are compared with the
   theoretical findings.
   Key assumptions: Mutations in life-history parameters are assumed to be
   small. A separation of the ecological and evolutionary time scales is
   assumed. There is a feedback loop between the environment and its
   inhabitants.
   Conclusions: With equilibrium population dynamics the shape of the
   trade-off can be used to characterize the evolutionary behaviour.
   Trade-offs with accelerating costs produce a continuously stable
   strategy (CSS). Trade-offs with decelerating costs produce a

Abstract = {{Aims To describe the pattern of mean body size of native mammals in
   Europe, and to investigate its relationships with environmental
   predictors related to four hypotheses: (1) dispersal; (2) heat
   conservation; (3) heat dissipation; and (4) resource availability.
   Location Continental western Europe and Great Britain.
   Methods We used range maps to estimate the mean body size (average log
   mass) of mammals in 386 cells of 12,100 km(2) each. Environmental
   conditions in each cell were quantified using nine historical, climatic
   and primary production variables. We attempted to tease apart the
   effects of these variables using correlation, multiple regression and
   spatial autocorrelation analyses.
   Results In the part of the continent covered by ice during the
   Pleistocene, body mass decreases southwards, and annual average
   temperature explains 73\% of the variance in body size, consistent with
   the heat-conservation hypothesis. However, in warmer, non-glaciated
   areas the best predictor is an estimate of seasonality in plant
   production, but it explains only 18\% of the variance. Carnivores,
   omnivores and herbivores show similar relationships, but the pattern for
   herbivores is substantially weaker than for the other groups.
   Main conclusions Overall, the relationship between mean body size and
   temperature is non-linear, being strong in cold environments but
   virtually disappearing above a temperature threshold.}},

Title = {{A new LCA methodology of technology evolution (TE-LCA) and its
   application to the production of ammonia (1950-2000)}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{98-105}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Goal, Scope and Background. This paper presents a new LCA method of
   technology evolution (TE-LCA), and its application to the production of
   ammonia, the second largest chemical product in the world, over the last
   fifty years. The TE-LCA of a chemical process is the procedure in which
   historical information on a process, mainly the evolution of technical
   parameters, is translated by simulation to mass and energy balances as a
   function of time. These mass and energy balances are then transformed
   into environmental impact indicators using common LCA approaches.
   Finally, the evolution of environmental impact resulting from the
   investigated process can be related to its technical and other, i.e.
   legislative, developments.
   Methods. The technological evolution of the production of ammonia was
   compiled according to three basic Sources of information: patents,
   publications and industry data. From these sources in a first step, the
   major technological advances of the process were identified as a
   function of time delivering different process variants that were
   modelled using the simulation software Aspen Plus (R). In a second step,
   the evolution of environmental regulations is studied. For those energy
   related emissions that were regulated, e.g. SOx and NOx, it was assumed
   that threshold values defined in legislation were realized immediately.
   The aggregation of both steps allows the calculation of the emissions
   resulting from the production (cradle to gate view) of the investigated
   chemical as a function of time.
   Results and Discussion. The application of the TE-LCA to the production
   of ammonia revealed when and to which extent technological and
   legislative developments resulted in the reduction of energy related
   emissions in the production of this chemical compound. Overall, the
   reduction of emissions from ammonia production was highly influenced by
   the technological development and only to a lower extent by
   environmental regulations.
   Conclusion. The results obtained from the TE-LCA method is useful to
   reveal how the environmental performance of a process developed in the
   past and to identify the reasons for this development. The investigated
   case Study of ammonia production shows that investment in technological
   development also paid off in terms of being ahead of tightened
   environmental legislation that might bear potential cost consequences
   such as carbon dioxide tax.
   Outlook. The presented method can be easily extended by including an
   economic analysis, which provides additional information on why certain
   technological developments were enforced and which the economic
   consequences of changes in environmental legislation were. The new
   methodology has to be applied to additional case studies, i.e. to other
   chemical sectors than basic chemicals and to other branches than
   chemicals. In other chemical sectors, toxic emissions from the
   production process might have to be considered and trade-offs between
   these and the overall energy consumption might result.}},

Abstract = {{A fuzzy rule based cloud classification scheme is proposed to estimate
   the cloud cover from satellite imagery. METEOSAT-5 images are classified
   into three classes: cloudy, partially cloudy, and clear sky. Five
   features, which measure the temporal and spatial properties of visible
   (VIS) and infrared (IR) images of METEOSAT-5, are used for this. The
   proposed classifier finds out a few human understandable rules (fuzzy
   rules) using exploratory data analysis. A novel attribute of the system
   is that it analyzes the behavior of misclassifications during training
   (i.e., typical mistakes) to extract a few more rules which are augmented
   to the initial rule base to improve its performance. The scheme is
   tested on images other than the training image(s) and the performance is
   found to be quite satisfactory. A post-processing scheme is also
   developed, which utilizes experts' knowledge to generate additional
   rules to account for coastal region, sunglint areas, and snow-covered
   Himalayan region. This improves the performance of the system further.
   Finally, the classification results are compared with multispectral
   threshold tests, surface synoptic observations, and total cloud cover
   (tcdc) of reanalysis data produced by National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction (NCEP) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).
   The high accuracy achieved by the proposed method may be attributed to
   (1) better design philosophy of classifiers; (2) good choice for the
   feature vectors; (3) accurate labeling of training data; and (4)
   exploitation of experts' knowledge. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Question: Large variation in the similarity between seed bank and
   standing vegetation generally occurs along environmental gradients. We
   asked: 1. How is seed bank-vegetation similarity in Mediterranean
   semi-arid annual plant communities related to variation in primary
   productivity; 2. How is this productivity-similarity relationship
   affected by exclusion from grazing.
   Location: Mediterranean, semi-arid rangeland in the Northern Negev
   desert, Israel.
   Methods: Density of seeds and plants, and species composition of the
   seed bank and vegetation were compared in grazed and ungrazed subplots,
   in four neighbouring topographic sites differing in productivity. Seed
   bank samples were collected in autumn, just before the rainy season, and
   vegetation samples in the following spring, at peak above-ground
   biomass, when net primary productivity was assessed.
   Results: Quantitative and qualitative similarities between seed bank and
   the vegetation (Sorensen index values) varied between 0.14-0.61 and
   0.40-0.68. Quantitative similarity and productivity were positively and
   linearly related within the low productivity range (up to 160 g.m(-2)),
   in both grazed and ungrazed subplots. In contrast, at higher
   productivity levels (up to 500 g.m(-2)), similarity decreased slightly
   with productivity in the ungrazed subplots, but no trend Occurred in the
   grazed subplots. At low productivity, grazing did not affect similarity,
   while at higher productivity grazing prevented the reduction in
   similarity with increasing productivity.
   Conclusion: seed bank - vegetation similarity, with and without grazing,
   is positively related to productivity up to a threshold range, above
   which soil resource availability is no longer the factor limiting plant
   density. Above this range grazing prevents a reduction in similarity
   with increasing productivity, by diminishing vegetation cover and litter
   accumulation that constrain germination, seedling emergence and plant
   survival.}},

Title = {{Including mixtures in the determination of water quality criteria for

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{426-435}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring programs throughout America and Europe have demonstrated the
   common occurrence of herbicides in surface water. Nevertheless, mixtures
   are rarely taken into account in water quality regulation. Taking
   mixtures into account is only feasible if the water quality criteria
   (WGC) of the single compounds are derived by a common and consistent
   methodology, which overcomes differences in data quality without
   settling on the lowest common denominator but making best use of all
   available data. In this paper, we present a method of defining a risk
   quotient for mixtures of herbicides with a similar mode of action
   (RQ(m)). Consistent and comparable WGC are defined for single herbicides
   as a basis for the calculation of the RQ(m) Derived from the
   concentration addition model, the RQ(m) can be expressed as the sum of
   the ratios of the measured environmental concentration and the WQC for
   each herbicide. The RQ(m) should be less than one to ensure an
   acceptable risk to aquatic life. This approach has the advantage of
   being easy to calculate and communicate, and is proposed as a
   replacement for the current limit of 0.1 mu g/L for herbicides in
   Switzerland. We illustrate the proposed approach on the example of five
   commonly applied herbicides (atrazine, simazine, terbuthylazine,
   isoproturon, and diuron). Their risk profile, i.e., the RQ(m) as a
   function of time for one exemplary river, clearly shows that the single
   compounds rarely exceeded their individual WGC. However,the contribution
   of peaks of different seasonally applied herbicides, whose application
   periods partially overlap, together with the continuously emitted
   herbicides from nonagricultural use, results in the exceedance of the
   RG(m) threshold value of one upon several occasions.}},

Abstract = {{Cladosporium is one of the most common airborne molds found in indoor
   and outdoor environments. Cladosporium spores are important
   aeroallergens, and prolonged exposure to elevated spore concentrations
   can provoke chronic allergy and asthma. To accurately quantify the
   levels of Cladosporium in indoor and outdoor environments, two real-time
   PCR systems were developed in this study. The two real-time PCR systems
   are highly specific and sensitive for Cladosporium detection even in a
   high background of other fungal DNAs. These methods were employed to
   quantify Cladosporium in aerosols of five different indoor environments.
   The investigation revealed a high spore concentration of Cladosporium
   (10(7) m(-3)) in a cow barn that accounted for 28-44\% of the airborne
   fungal propagules. In a countryside house that uses firewood for heating
   and in a paper and pulp factory, Cladosporium was detected at 10(4)
   spores m(-3), which accounted for 2-6\% of the fungal propagules in the
   aerosols. The concentrations of Cladosporium in these three indoor
   environments far exceeded the medical borderline level (3000 spores
   m(-3)). In a power station and a fruit and vegetable storage,
   Cladosporitan was found to be a minor component in the aerosols,
   accounted for 0.01-0.1\% of the total fungal propagules. These results
   showed that monitoring Cladosporium in indoor environments is more
   important than in outdoor environments from the public health point of
   view. Cladosporium may not be the dominant fungi in some indoor
   environments, but its concentration could still be exceeding the
   threshold value for clinical significance. The methods developed in this
   study could facilitate accurate detection and quantification of
   Cladosporium for public health related risk assessment.}},

Abstract = {{The phosphorus (P) index is the preferred method of implementing P-based
   nutrient management plans in Pennsylvania. The P index is a field level
   risk assessment tool that quantifies P source and transport factors to
   determine if management changes are necessary to avoid off-site
   transport of P to surface waters. It is important for conservation
   officials to understand the effect P restrictions will have on farms and
   farming communities. This study applied the P index to 276 fields on 13
   farms in two Pennsylvania counties, Lancaster and Snyder, which were
   previously identified as having the potential to face severe
   restrictions under P-based nutrient management. Of all soil samples, 18
   percent exceeded the 200 ppm environmental soil P threshold which
   triggers full assessment under the P index. Lancaster County had
   significantly greater soil P test levels compared to Snyder County.
   Trends of increased soil P test and increased P restriction were
   observed as animal density increased. Additionally, soil P levels on
   land with animal concentration areas exhibited significantly greater
   soil P, compared to cropland and pastures. Preliminary screening based
   on soil test P levels and proximity to water, indicated that full P
   index assessment was required for 46 percent of the fields in Lancaster
   County and 19 percent of the fields in Snyder County. This indicates
   that Lancaster will face greater nutrient management planning costs.
   After applying the full P index, Lancaster and Snyder Counties had 31
   and 12 percent of the fields P restricted, respectively. Four highly
   impacted farms were closely examined to determine the feasibility of
   complying with P restrictions. Two farms were able to comply with
   on-farm options, and two required a solution that would require moving P
   offsite. Farms studied were representative of localities where animal
   agriculture is a critical part of the economy. The large proportion of
   fields restricted under the P index-20 percent of all fields
   studied-indicates that technical and financial assistance may be
   required to allow these operations to remain economically viable.
   Additionally, conservation officials need to be mindful of the need for
   long-term solutions that address the fundamental problem of regional
   nutrient surpluses.}},

Abstract = {{Predictive models of the spatial distribution and abundance of species
   based on habitat characteristics are finding increasing use in
   management and conservation. The European badger attracts interest as a
   model species both for conservation reasons and because of the important
   role the species is playing in understanding carnivore sociality. We
   developed a statistical habitat model based on presence/absence data on
   badger setts. To maximise the utility of the model in management, we
   limited the choice of model variables to those that had a clear basis in
   badger ecology and that could be obtained on a nation-wide digital
   format. We extrapolated the habitat model to a region in Denmark and
   developed a threshold-independent sett distribution algorithm to
   estimate sett densities. The habitat model was simpler than previously
   published models of badger sett habitat selection, but nevertheless had
   a predictive ability in excess of 80\% judged against independent data.
   The sett distribution algorithm was able to simultaneously reproduce
   several observed patterns of sett density and distribution over the
   probability gradient. It thus represents a significant improvement over
   threshold-dependent methods used to discriminate between suitable and
   unsuitable habitat predicted by presence/absence regression models. Our
   approach demonstrates that a model of badger sett habitat suitability
   with high predictive power can be obtained using easily accessible
   map-variables and presence/absence data. This is a prerequisite for
   using habitat models as predictive tools over large areas. The use of a
   simple sett distribution algorithm circumvents the common problem of
   subjectively fixing a threshold to discriminate between suitable and
   unsuitable habitat. In conjunction the models presented here constitute
   an important contribution to the management of the badger in Denmark
   and, upon further validation, possibly to similar regions in Northern
   Europe.}},

   use of perchloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) in dry
   cleaning and metal degreasing. The results show that, in applications
   such as metal degreasing and dry cleaning, long-term (steady-state)
   concentrations at the workplace are up to 6 orders of magnitude higher
   than ambient air levels. Legal threshold values may be exceeded,
   depending on machine technology, size, and surrounding working
   conditions. The impact from workplace exposure to the total
   human-toxicity potential of the complete life cycle of PCE and TCE
   (including use, production, and disposal) is accordingly high. We
   therefore conclude that occupational health effects need to be
   considered in LCA to prevent overlooking key environmental-health
   impacts in LCA.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to analyze the contamination potential associated with
   the reactive transport of nitrate-N and ammonium-N in the Choushui River
   alluvial fan, Taiwan and to evaluate a risk region in developing a
   groundwater protection policy in 2021. In this area, ail aquifer redox
   sequence provided a good understanding of the spatial distributions of
   nitrate-N and ammonium-N and of aerobic and anaerobic environments.
   Equiprobable hydraulic conductivity (K) fields reproduced by
   geostatistical methods characterized the spatial uncertainty of
   contaminant transport in the heterogeneous aquifer. Nitrogen
   contamination potential fronts for high and low threshold concentrations
   based on a 95\% risk probability were used to assess different levels of
   risk. The simulated result reveals that the spatial uncertainty of
   highly heterogeneous K fields governs the contamination potential
   assessment of the nitrogen compounds along the regional flow directions.
   The contamination potential of nitrate-N is more uncertain than that for
   ammonium-N. The high nitrate-N concentrations (>= 3 mg/L) are prevalent
   in the aerobic environment. The low concentration nitrate-N Plumes (0.5
   - 3 mg/L) gradually migrate to the mid-fan area and to a maximum
   distance of 15 km from the aerobic region. The nitrate-N plumes pose a
   potential human health risk in the aerobic and anaerobic environments.
   The ammonium-N plumes remain stably confined to the distal-fan and
   partial mid-fan areas. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of fractals in ecology is currently pervasive over many areas.
   However, very few studies have linked fractal properties of landscapes

   that lacunarity (a measure of the landscape texture) is a well suited
   ecologically scaled landscape index that can be explicitly incorporated
   in metapopulation models such as the classical Levins equation. I show
   that the average lacunarity of an aggregated landscape is linearly
   correlated to the habitat that a species with local spatial processed
   information may perceive. Lacunarity is a computationally feasible index
   to measure, and is related to the metapopulation capacity of landscapes.
   A general approach to multiftactal landscapes has been conceived, and
   some analytical results for self-similar landscapes are outlined,
   including the specific effect of landscape heterogeneity, decoupled from
   that of contagion by dispersal. Spatially explicit simulations show

Abstract = {{Restoration of streams degraded by urbanization has usually been
   attempted by enhancement of instream habitat or riparian zones. Such
   restoration approaches are unlikely to substantially improve instrearn
   ecological condition because they do not match the scale of the
   degrading process. Recent studies of urban impacts on streams in
   Melbourne, Australia, on water chemistry, algal biomass and assemblage
   composition of diatoms and invertebrates, suggested that the primary
   degrading process to streams in many urban areas is effective
   imperviousness (EI), the proportion of a catchment covered by impervious
   surfaces directly connected to the stream by stormwater drainage pipes.
   The direct connection of impervious surfaces to streams means that even
   small rainfall events can produce sufficient surface runoff to cause
   frequent disturbance through regular delivery of water and pollutants;
   where impervious surfaces are not directly connected to streams, small
   rainfall events are intercepted and infiltrated. We, therefore,
   identified use of alternative drainage methods, which maintain a
   near-natural frequency of surface runoff from the catchment, as the best
   approach to stream restoration in urban catchments and then used models
   of relationships between 14 ecological indicators and EI to determine
   restoration objectives. Ecological condition, as indicated by
   concentrations of water-quality variables, algal biomass, and several
   measures of diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblage composition,
   declined with increasing El until a threshold was reached (EI =
   0.01-0.14), beyond which no further degradation was observed. We showed,
   in a sample catchment, that it is possible to redesign the drainage
   system to reduce El to a level at which the models predict detectable
   improvement in most ecological indicators. Distributed, low-impact
   design measures are required that intercept rainfall from small events
   and then facilitate its infiltration, evaporation, transpiration, or
   storage for later in-house use.}},

Abstract = {{Biological metrics are increasingly employed by regulatory agencies to
   assess ecosystem condition for the purposes of conservation,
   restoration, mitigation and creation. While indices of biotic integrity
   (IBI) have been shown to correspond strongly with anthropogenic
   disturbance, they are time consuming and expensive to implement and
   require advanced taxonomic knowledge. Regulatory implementation
   frequently necessitates simplified indicators of community composition
   that do not excessively sacrifice ecological specificity. Detailed
   observations of vegetative community composition and structure in
   isolated depressional herbaceous (n = 75) and forested (n = 118)
   wetlands were undertaken to identify integrative biotic metrics of
   community condition. Habitat-specific wetland condition indices (WCI)
   composed of five to six relativized biotic metrics (\% non-native plant
   species, \% tolerant and \% sensitive plant species,
   perennial-to-annual/biennial ratio, mean floristic quality, species
   hydric status) were previously developed. From these quantitative
   indices of condition, classification (CT) and regression tree (RT)

   class for both systems and misclassified sites tended to fall near
   categorical threshold values. High validation specificity was observed
   for severely degraded sites (89\% for both systems) and minimally

Abstract = {{In recent years, nitrate (NO3) contamination of groundwater has become a
   growing concern for people in rural areas in North China Plain (NCP)
   where groundwater is used as drinking water. The objective of this study
   was to evaluate groundwater resource level, to determine groundwater
   quality and to assess the risk of NO3 pollution in groundwater in Quzhou
   County in the NCP. Ordinary Kriging (OK) method was used to analyze the
   spatial variability of shallow groundwater level, groundwater electrical
   conductivity (EC) and NO3-N concentrations, and Indictor Kriging (IK)
   method was used to analyze the data with NO3-N concentrations equal or
   greater than the groundwater NO3 pollution threshold (20 mg L-1). The
   results indicated that groundwater level averaged 9.81 m, a level 6 m
   lower than in 1990. The spatial correlation distances for groundwater
   level, EC and NO3-N concentration were 21.93, 2.19 and 3.55 km,
   respectively. The contour map showed that shallow groundwater level
   areas extended from north to south across the County. Groundwater EC was
   above 3 dS m(-1) in the most part of the northern county. Groundwater
   NO3 pollution (NO3 -N >= 20 mg L-1) mainly occurred in the County Seat
   areas due to wastewater irrigation and excessive fertilizer leaching
   from agricultural fields. At Henantuang town, besides suburban of the
   County Seat, groundwater was also contaminated by NO3 shown by the map
   generated using the IK method, which was not reflected in the map
   generated using the OK method. The map generated using the OK method
   could not reflect correctly the groundwater NO3 pollution status. The IK
   method is useful to assess the risk of NO3 Pollution by giving the
   conditional probability of NO3 concentration exceeding the threshold
   value. It is suggested that risk assessment of NO3 pollution is useful
   for better managing groundwater resource, preventing soil salinization

Abstract = {{This paper discusses two model-based geostatistical methods for spatial

   a Poisson distribution, while the second method assumes a log-Nortnal
   distribution. First, these methods were compared using an extensive data
   set covering the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Second, the focus was
   placed on only the Netherlands, where only a small data set was used.
   Bayesian techniques were used for parameter estimation and
   interpolation. Parameter estimates are comparable due to the log-link in
   both models. Incorporating data from adjacent countries improves
   parameter estimation. The Poisson model predicts more accurately
   (maximum kriging standard deviation of 2.16 compared to 2.69) but shows
   smoother surfaces than the log-Normal model. The log-Normal approach
   ensures a better representation of the observations and gives more
   realistic patterns (an RMSE of 2.26 compared to 2.44). Model-based
   geostatistical procedures are useful to interpolate limited data sets of

Abstract = {{The determination of predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) and
   sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) of toxic chemicals in marine sediment
   is extremely important in ecological risk assessment. However, current
   methods of deriving sediment PNECs or threshold effect levels (TELs) are
   primarily based on laboratory ecotoxicity bioassays that may not be
   ecologically and environmentally relevant. This study explores the
   possibility of utilizing field data of benthic communities and
   contaminant loadings concurrently measured in sediment samples collected
   from the Norwegian continental shelf to derive SQGs. This unique dataset
   contains abundance data for ca. 2200 benthic species measured at over
   4200 sampling stations, along with co-occurring concentration data for >
   25 chemical species. Using barium, cadmium, and total polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as examples, this paper describes a novel
   approach that makes use of the above data set for constructing
   field-based species sensitivity distributions (f-SSDs). Field-based SQGs

   field-data-derived criteria appear to be more environmentally relevant

   field-data-derived SQGs can be used as site-specific guidelines or

Abstract = {{This paper describes an approach for conducting spatial uncertainty
   analysis of spatial population models, and illustrates the ecological
   consequences of spatial uncertainty for landscapes with different
   properties. Spatial population models typically simulate birth, death,
   and migration on an input map that describes habitat. Typically, only a
   single ``reference{''} map is available, but we can imagine that a
   collection of other, slightly different, maps could be drawn to
   represent a particular species' habitat. As a first approximation, our
   approach assumes that spatial uncertainty (i.e., the variation among
   values assigned to a location by such a collection of maps) is
   constrained by characteristics of the reference map, regardless of how
   the map was produced. Our approach produces lower levels of uncertainty
   than afternative methods used in landscape ecology because we condition
   our alternative landscapes on local properties of the reference map.
   Simulated spatial uncertainty was higher near the borders of patches.
   Consequently, average uncertainty was highest for reference maps with
   equal proportions of suitable and unsuitable habitat, and no spatial
   autocorrelation. We used two population viability models to evaluate the
   ecological consequences of spatial uncertainty for landscapes with
   different properties. Spatial uncertainty produced larger variation
   among predictions of a spatially explicit model than those of a
   spatially implicit model. Spatially explicit model predictions of final
   female population size varied most among landscapes with enough
   clustered habitat to allow persistence. In contrast, predictions of
   population growth rate varied most among landscapes with only enough
   clustered habitat to support a small population, i.e., near a spatially
   mediated extinction threshold. We conclude that spatial uncertainty has
   the greatest effect on persistence when the amount and arrangement of
   suitable habitat are such that habitat capacity is near the minimum
   required for persistence. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   estimation of population size for populations with prominent nesting
   structures (i.e., bald eagle nests). In the context of a bald eagle
   population, the number of nests in a list frame corresponds to a
   ``pre-marked'' sample of nests, and an area frame corresponds to a set
   of transect strips that could be regularly monitored. Unlike previous
   methods based on dual frame methodology using the screening estimator

   Statistics, 5, 245-256, 1998a; Survey Methodology, 24( 1), 79-88,

   (i.e., all the nests in the sampled sites do not need to be seen). One
   may use line transect sampling to estimate the probability of detection
   in a sampled area. Combining information from list and area frames
   provides more efficient estimators than those obtained by using data
   from only one frame. We derive an estimator for detection probability
   and generalize the screening estimator. A simulation study is carried
   out to compare the performance of the Chapman modi. cation of the
   Lincoln-Petersen estimator to the screening estimator. Simulation
   results show that although the Chapman estimator is generally less
   precise than the screening estimator, the latter can be severely biased
   in presence of uncertain detection. The screening estimator outperforms
   the Chapman estimator in terms of mean squared error when detection
   probability is near 1 wheareas the Chapman estimator outperforms the
   screening estimator when detection probability is lower than a certain
   threshold value depending on particular scenarios.}},

   the sandy fraction, Cr and Co were also below this limit. Cd, Ni, Cu and
   Zn exceeded the threshold values in some of the batch experiments

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The concept of body mass dynamics can be viewed as part of life history
   theory, but its potential has remained largely untapped due to a lack of
   analytical methodology. We therefore propose a method, called
   contribution analysis, which enables us to decompose a change in body
   mass into contributions associated with variations in individual egg
   mass, clutch size, and standard somatic mass (somatic mass adjusted to
   body length). The advantage of contribution analysis is that various
   contributions are expressed in the same units (units of mass) and show
   the amount of resources committed to changes in the individual traits,
   while the traits themselves are measured in different units and thus
   incomparable on their own. The method is tuned to study zooplankton, and
   is applied to examine body mass dynamics in Daphnia galeata. We found
   that when recovering from a poor-resource environment just above the
   threshold food concentration, Daphnia primarily increase their standard
   somatic mass, that is, restore body condition. When the trophic
   environment improves further but remains below the incipient limiting
   level, resources are invested equally to enhance body condition and
   reproduction in terms of clutch size. Finally, when food is no longer a
   limiting factor, almost all resources are committed to increase clutch
   size. While individual egg mass also varies, it never attracts more
   resources than the shift in the most prioritized trait. We suggest that
   the significance of this shift in resource allocation priorities is to
   keep an adult female alive in a poor environment and thus to allow her
   to retain her reproductive potential for better conditions in the
   future. Contribution analysis of body mass dynamics may allow us to
   detect flexible allocation strategies in a changing natural environment.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{{[}1] Methods for obtaining estimates of seepage into drifts and tunnels
   excavated in unsaturated fractured rocks are of interest for engineering
   and environmental applications. For uniform porous media a tunnel
   surface may present a capillary barrier promoting water diversion around
   the opening through the porous matrix, hence reducing seepage into the
   opening. The presence of fractures intersecting the opening complicates
   flow behavior and presents a challenge to seepage prediction. We present
   a simple and physically based model for seepage estimation that
   preserves key physical processes associated with fracture flow, while
   avoiding complexity of detailed fracture network characterization. The
   processes of film and capillary-driven flows are combined with a
   geometrically tractable representation of the dual-continuum fractured
   rock with two disparate populations of matrix pores and fracture
   apertures. The large disparity in capillary forces between matrix and
   fractures rules out matrix seepage based on Philip's theory. We obtain
   estimates of seepage fraction for a given percolation flux from
   consideration of the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture domain only.
   Similar to previous studies, the new model shows existence of a
   percolation threshold for onset of seepage. The new model also exhibits
   a steep increase in seepage with increase in percolation flux that
   reflects the role of fracture film flow. In addition to consideration of
   physically based flow processes, computations for the proposed
   analytical model can be performed with common spreadsheet software,
   which is a distinct advantage over numerical equivalent porous media
   approaches that require a powerful computational environment, excessive
   computation time, and thorough characterization of the fracture domain.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{It is increasingly important to be able to monitor and maintain the
   quality of estuaries for overwintering shorebirds. Bird numbers alone
   are not sufficient to indicate quality nor, as recent research shows,
   can it be assumed that site quality is being maintained simply because
   there is enough food to meet the birds' physiological demands; i.e., the
   amount of food available per bird in autumn needs to be greater than the
   amount eaten. But how much greater? We used a simple individuals-based
   and behaviour-based model to explore the factors that affect the
   relationship between overwinter mortality and the amount of food
   available per bird in autumn (the food:bird ratio). The aims were to
   explore how the natural history characteristics of a shorebird species
   affected the shape of this relationship, in order to identify
   characteristics of the system that should be included in any monitoring
   programme of site quality. In all cases there was a minimum threshold
   food:bird ratio above which mortality did not vary and below which
   mortality increased steadily. The amount of food per bird required at
   the threshold varied from one to six times the amount actually consumed
   by each bird during winter, depending on the amount of realism included
   in the model. The minimum threshold ratio was most strongly influenced
   by the shape of the relationship between intake rate and prey density -
   the functional response - and, when interference competition occurred,
   by the distribution of the birds' main food supply. Simulations with
   realistic spatial distributions of prey predicted that the minimum
   required amount of food per bird would be between two and five times the
   amount actually consumed. The threshold approach could provide a simple
   method of monitoring estuary quality based on food supply and bird
   numbers. It also provides a potentially clearly-defined and unambiguous
   measure of the carrying capacity of a site. If applied to a sufficient
   number of real estuaries, general guidelines for maintaining estuary
   quality based on estuary characteristics, food supply and bird species
   might be established. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of Cd trophic transfer from benthic diatoms to the
   Prosobranch mud snail Hydrobia ulvae was described experimentally in
   microcosms using Cd contaminated microalgae (0.71, 3.63 and 8.54 mu g Cd
   mg Chl a(-1)). The depurated mud snails (2 ind. cm(-2)) were allowed to
   feed on the stable Cd pre-contaminated benthic diatoms at the
   concentration of 2 mg Chl a dm(-3) to ensure that the algal food
   availability was not a limiting factor. Weight-specific ingestion rate
   (IR) and assimilation efficiency (AE) were calculated by an indirect
   mass-balance method on the basis of metal residues in the snail tissues,
   and metal loss (efflux rate, Delta e) was estimated for the time
   intervals when a decrease or no change in the tissue metal
   concentrations occurred.
   A similar pattern of consumption was observed in all experiments:
   ingestion was rapid over the first 4 h, followed by slower ingestion
   period (between 4 and 16 h). The feeding behaviour of H. ulvae was not
   affected by the different diatom Cd concentrations. An analogous
   two-phasic pattern was observed in the tissue Cd concentration changes.
   Net accumulation of Cd in the snails was observed for the two highest
   exposures, indicating that the Cd threshold concentration in food above
   which metal is retained in the body, lies between 0.71 and 3.63 mu g Cd
   mg Chl a(-1). The respective 16-h AEs were 0.024\% and 0.004\%
   potentially due to rapid gut-passage of microalgae and/or diminished
   nutritional value of the food. The efflux rates, calculated for the last
   12 h of exposure, were positively related to the concentration of Cd in
   the snail tissues and microalgae. This study demonstrated that trophic
   transfer should be considered as a source of Cd accumulation in snails
   and the ability of H. ulvae to enhance their rate of Cd elimination in
   response to elevated metal concentrations in the ambient environment is
   relevant for models predicting metal bioaccumulation and toxicity in
   coastal and estuarine systems. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {{Many ecological time series describe population dynamics. Indirectly,
   these data also provide information about the vital rates (e.g., birth
   rates, mortality rates) underlying these dynamics, but extracting this
   information from the data can be difficult. Here, we present a method
   for estimating fluctuating vital rates from ecological time series by
   using a model to re-code information in observed dynamics into
   information about unobserved vital rates. This model construction
   differs from most current models by replacing strong assumptions about
   the functional relationships dictating population dynamics with more
   conservative assumptions about how vital rates change with time. Thus,
   this method is a tool for analyzing time-series data that avoids strong
   assumptions about the mechanisms driving population dynamics.
   Our work is motivated by studying the biological control of pea aphids
   in alfalfa in south-central Wisconsin. Pea aphid populations are
   consistently held below economic threshold, although the source of this
   regulation is unclear. Here, we analyze monitoring data to understand
   the role that a specialist parasitoid plays in aphid biocontrol. Our
   modeling methodology allows us to estimate the vital rates that
   determine aphid dynamics (in particular, parasitism) without making
   arbitrary assumptions about the relationship between parasitism and
   aphid or parasitoid density. We find that, while parasitism depresses
   aphid population growth rate substantially, declines in aphid Population
   growth rates do not coincide with increases in parasitism. Therefore,
   parasitism cannot be responsible for the density-dependent regulation of
   aphid populations observed in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of sea turtles spend part of their life cycle gathered in

   mixed-stock analysis to mitochondrial DNA samples from rookeries and
   mixed populations to estimate the contributions of different rookeries
   to the mixed stock. These methods are limited by the amount of genetic
   overlap between rookeries and fail to incorporate ecological covariates
   such as rookery size and location within major ocean currents that are
   strongly suspected to affect rookery contributions. A new hierarchical
   Bayesian model for rookery contributions incorporates these covariates
   (and potentially others) to draw stronger conclusions from existing

   cases,: it can accurately estimate turtle origins even when turtles come
   from rookeries with high degrees of genetic overlap., Applying the model
   to more complex simulations shows that it performs well in a wide range

   Location Western United States.
   Method We used an ecological envelope approach that was based on seven
   bioclimatic factors, two topographic factors, and two edaphic factors.
   Multivariate factor analysis was then used to reduce the envelope to two
   dimensions. The relative density of habitat and protected areas were
   identified in each part of the envelope based on the current climate and
   potential future climate. We used this information to identify gaps in

   Results Although the protected areas occurred in all parts of the
   envelope, most existed in colder and drier areas. This was true for both
   the current climate and potential future climate.
   Main conclusion To protect more of the ecological envelope, future
   conservation efforts would be most effective in western Oregon,

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Many disease resistance traits in plants have a polygenic background and
   the disease phenotypes are modified by environmental factors. As a
   consequence, the phenotypic values usually show a quantitative
   variation. The phenotypes of such disease traits, however, are often
   measured in discrete but ordered categories. These traits are called
   ordinal traits. In terms of disease resistance, they are called
   quantitative resistance traits, as opposed to qualitative resistance
   traits, and are controlled by the quantitative resistance loci (QRL).
   Classical quantitative trait locus mapping methods are not optimal for
   ordinal trait analysis because the assumption of normal distribution is
   violated. Methods for mapping binary trait loci are not suitable either
   because there are more than two categories in ordinal traits. We
   developed a maximum likelihood method to map these QRL. The method is
   implemented via a multicycle expectation-conditional-maximization (ECM)
   algorithm under the threshold model, where we can estimate both the QRL
   effects and the thresholds that link the disease liability and the

Pages = {{135-140}},
Abstract = {{The influence of low-level noise has not been widely noticed. This paper
   discovered that low-level and low frequency noise(A-weighted equivalent
   level L-eq < 45 dB) causes higher probability of subjective annoyance.
   The fuzzy mathematic principle was applied to deal with the threshold
   level of subjective annoyance from noise in this study; there is
   preferable relationship between the indoor noise and noise annoyance at
   low frequency noise level. Study indicated at the same centered noise
   level, the change of annoyance probability is mainly caused by the
   change of the frequency spectrum characteristic of the indoor noise.
   Under low noise level environment, without change of the medium-low
   frequency noise, the slight increase of medium-high frequency noise
   level with the help of noise sheltering effect can significantly reduce
   the noise annoyance. This discovery brings a new resolution on how to
   improve the environmental quality of working or living places. A noise
   control model is given in this study according to the acoustic analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Mahalanobis Distance (D(2)) Statistic is a multivariate statistical
   method that has been used to model habitars occupied by wildlife and

   probability values, represents the similarity of a given set of values
   with those of an optimum habitat configuration defined exclusively by
   sites where the species of interest is known to occur. Typically, all
   principal components with nonzero eigenvalues are used to calculate D(2)
   values. We partitioned D(2) into contributions from individual principal
   components (PCs) and selected PCs corresponding to relatively invariant
   aspects of the environment across all Use Sites to formulate D(2)(k).
   Partitioned Malialanobis D(2)(k) represents the similarity of a given

   confirmed timber rattlesnake hibernacula on the Madison County Wildlife
   Management Area in northwest Arkansas, USA, using slope, aspect,
   elevation, and 11 physical soil attributes. We retained 4 of 15
   principal components in D(2)(k = 4) calculations, and minimum habitat
   requirements corresponded to a combination of moderate Slope, South to

   bootstrap and cross-validation techniques to examine the stability of
   the correlation matrix and the effect of each site on overall D(2)(k)
   values. The D(2)(k = 4) model specifically highlighted habitats similar
   to known rattlesnake hibernacula. We present a method to translate the
   probability surface into a qualitative data layer useful in making
   management decisions by examining the cumulative distributions of the
   percentages of (1) hibernacula correctly classified and (2) the study
   area predicted. We selected the probability threshold that maximized the
   predictive gain by including the greatest number of hibernacula in the
   smallest area. The probability threshold 0.2 captured 82\% of the known
   hibernacula in 25\% of the 5,666-ha study area. Partitioned Malialanobis

Abstract = {{Wide-scale and sudden shifts in several biological and environmental
   systems of NW Europe have been reported in recent years, and attributed
   to a range of factors, both climatic and anthropogenic. To examine
   whether there is any evidence of coinciding region-wide environmental
   shifts, we gathered existing long-term data series on a wide range of
   physical and biological parameters from the 1960s to the present and,
   following the methods of a similar recent study on North Pacific regime
   shifts, we analysed the data using principal component analysis and
   regime shift analysis to identify the extent and timing of regime shifts
   in NW Europe. The end-point of a regime (i.e. the year) was determined
   using a sliding window in regime shift analysis. Additionally we applied
   chronological clustering to the (1) combined data, (2) biological data
   and (3) environmental data. In all 3 cases, the same regimes were
   identified. Our results indicate that substantial regime shifts occurred
   in the marine ecosystem in 1979 and 1988 and perhaps also in 1998,
   although results were less clear-cut in the latter case. These regime
   shifts were most evident among the biological data series, but they
   appeared to have been triggered by earlier shifts in a number of
   environmental factors. Salinity and weather conditions played an
   important role in the 1979 shift, while in the 1988 shift, temperature
   and weather conditions were the predominant factors. Our results confirm
   those of the North Pacific study, with concomitant changes in physical
   and biological indices. This indicates a shift in climate-ocean

Abstract = {{The current state of the world's fisheries resources requires further
   investigation into the means and methods for sustainable use of fish
   stocks. In this study, I assess the performance of different harvesting
   strategies on a population model developed for Norwegian spring spawning
   herring Clupea harengus, a stock historically known as one of the
   largest and most valuable fish stocks in the world. This stock is
   further characterized by strong long-term fluctuations in stock size,
   which considerably complicate successful population management. The
   results support the use of threshold strategies, where harvesting is
   only allowed if the population size of the target population is above a
   predetermined threshold. Threshold strategies are beneficial for
   maintaining spawning biomass, yield, and prevention of population
   collapse. The downside of a threshold approach is the fisheries
   moratoria associated with low stock size. To overcome this, I introduce
   a precautionary strategy including 2 thresholds for reducing the
   likelihood and length of moratoria, such that if the population size
   decreases below an upper threshold, the harvest ratio is decreased in
   order to achieve fast recovery to the target population size. I also
   test the effect of changing the timing of fish entering the harvestable
   stock by means of age-selective harvesting. I show that allowing
   reproduction, preferably more than once, before the fish become
   vulnerable to harvesting increases the spawning biomass and yield, and
   decreases the variability in yield and the risk of stock collapse.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting species occurrence using a modelling approach based on a
   geographic information system (GIS) represents a new methodological tool
   which can be used to endorse conservation policies, on condition that
   models are tested for reliability.
   Habitat suitability models are often used to predict species occurrence
   through the modelling of proper environmental variables. A major
   constraint in building large-scale models of species distribution is the
   availability of data and therefore the deductive approach is adopted.
   This approach is suitable for bio-diversity assessment as it can be
   applied to a great number of species, it does however require
   statistical validation, both to test the accuracy of the input
   information and to deal with presence data (often affected by high
   spatial and temporal variability).
   Available data are, in the large majority, represented by a small sample
   collected without an ad hoc sampling design and without information on
   species absence. Reliable information on absence is not easily obtained
   with animal species due to elusive behaviour, poorly accessible habitats
   and their activity patterns. Therefore, absence data are to be
   considered ambiguous. Hence the need to develop statistical tools to
   deal with presence-only data. Moreover, presence data are rarely
   geo-referenced with high precision. Often information on species
   presence is spatially degraded as referred to polygon within which the
   exact species location cannot be recovered. Consequently, the validation
   procedure should statistically consider this uncertainty.
   In this paper we suggest that a compositional procedure be used when
   presence-only data are affected by strong spatial and temporal
   variability, and that a multinomial (based) procedure be used when
   presence-only data are geo-referenced with high precision during an ad
   hoc field survey. The two procedures have been tested on a large number
   of deductive models built to represent the distribution of vertebrate
   species in Italy. Results show that both procedures allow the assessment
   of the calibration properties of the models. The reliability of the two
   methods is confirmed by a model rejection pattern, determined by
   ecological factors, scale issues, spatial accuracy and sample size. Both
   procedures have a wide range of applications being threshold
   independent. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Samples of un-weathered CCA-treated wood were tested using a variety of

   characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), synthetic precipitation
   leaching procedure (SPLP), extraction procedure toxicity method (EPTOX),
   waste extraction test (WET), multiple extraction procedure (MEP), and
   modifications of these procedures which utilized actual MSW landfill
   leachates, a construction and demolition (C\&D) debris leachate, and a
   concrete enhanced leachate. Additional experiments were conducted to
   assess factors affecting leaching, such as particle size, pH, and
   leaching contact time. Results from the regulatory leaching tests
   provided similar results with the exception of the WET, which extracted
   greater quantities of metals. Experiments conducted using actual MSW
   leachate, C\&D debris leachate, and concrete enhanced leachate provided
   results that were within the same order of magnitude as results obtained

   decreasing particle size and at pH extremes. All three metals leached
   above the drinking water standards thus possibly posing a potential risk

Abstract = {{Understanding how climate can interact with other factors in determining
   patterns of species abundance is a persistent challenge in ecology.
   Recent research has suggested that the dynamics exhibited by some
   populations may be a non-additive function of climate, with climate
   affecting population growth more strongly at high density than at low
   density. However, we lack methodologies to adequately explain patterns
   in population growth generated as a result of interactions between
   intrinsic factors and extrinsic climatic variation in non-linear
   systems. We present a novel method (the Functional Coefficient Threshold
   Auto-Regressive (FCTAR) method) that can identify interacting influences
   of climate and density on population dynamics from time-series data. We
   demonstrate its use on count data on the size of the Soay sheep
   population, which is known to exhibit dynamics generated by nonlinear
   and non-additive interactions between density and climate, living on
   Hirta in the St Kilda archipelago. The FCTAR method suggests that
   climate fluctuations can drive the Soay sheep population between
   different dynamical regimes-from stable population size through limit

Abstract = {{Three different risk assessment procedures are described that aim to

   first-tier approach, based on standard toxicity tests and the

   Distribution (SSD) approach, based on laboratory tests with a wider
   array of species and the application of a statistical model to calculate
   the HC(x) (the Hazardous Concentration for x\% of the species), and (3)
   the model ecosystem approach, based on the evaluation of
   treatment-related effects in field enclosures. A comparison of the risk
   assessment procedures reveals that the first-tier approach is the most
   conservative for metamitron and metribuzin, and that HC(5) values (and
   even HC(10) values) based on acute EC(50) values of algae and aquatic
   vascular plants may be used to derive maximum permissible concentrations
   for single applications. For both compounds these HC(5) values were very
   similar to the ecological threshold concentrations in the enclosure
   studies. In contrast to model ecosystem experiments, however, HC(x)
   values based on lab toxicity tests do not provide information on the
   recovery potential of sensitive endpoints and on indirect effects, which
   may be important for regulatory decision-making. In the enclosure study,

   estimate sea-ice melt and freeze onset dates: (1) the melt onset
   database derived from SSM/I passive microwave brightness temperatures
   (T(b)s) using Drobot and Anderson's {[}J. Geophys. Res. 106 (2001)
   24033] Advanced Horizontal Range Algorithm (AHRA) and distributed by the
   National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC); (2) the International Arctic
   Buoy Program/Polar Exchange at the Sea (IABP/POLES) surface air
   temperatures (SATs); (3) an elaborated version of the AHRA that uses
   IABP/POLES to avoid anomalous results (Passive Microwave and Surface
   Temperature Analysis {[}PMSTA]); (4) another elaborated version of the
   AHRA that uses T-b valiance to avoid anomalous results (Mean Differences
   and Standard Deviation Analysis {[}MDSDA]); (5) Smith's {[}J. Geophys.
   Res. 103 (1998) 27753] vertically polarized Tb algorithm for estimating
   melt onset in multiyear (MY) ice (SSM/I 19V-37V); and (6) analyses of
   concurrent backscattering cross section (sigma(o)) and brightness
   temperature (Tb) from OKEAN-01 satellite series. Melt onset and freeze
   onset maps were created and compared to understand how the estimates
   vary between different satellite instruments and methods over different
   Arctic sea-ice regions. Comparisons were made to evaluate relative
   sensitivities among the methods to slight adjustments of the Tb
   calibration coefficients and algorithm threshold values. Compared to the
   PMSTA method, the AHRA method tended to estimate significantly earlier
   melt dates, likely caused by the AHRA's susceptibility to prematurely
   identify melt onset conditions. In contrast, the IABP/POLES surface air
   temperature data tended to estimate later melt and earlier freeze in all
   but perennial ice. The MDSDA method was least sensitive to small
   adjustments of the SMMR-SSM/I inter-satellite calibration coefficients.
   Differences among methods varied by latitude. Freeze onset dates among
   methods were most disparate in southern latitudes, and tended to
   converge northward. Surface air temperatures (IABP/POLES) indicated
   freeze onset well before the MDSDA method, especially in southern
   peripheral seas, while PMSTA freeze estimates were generally
   intermediate. Surface air temperature data estimated latest melt onset
   dates in southern latitudes, but earliest melt onset in northern
   latitudes. The PMSTA estimated earliest melt onset dates in southern
   regions, and converged with the MDSDA northward. Because sea-ice melt
   and freeze are dynamical transitional processes, differences among these
   methods are associated with differing sensitivities to changing stages
   of environmental and physical development. These studies contribute to
   the growing body of documentation about the levels of disparity obtained
   when Arctic seasonal transition parameters are estimated using various
   types of microwave data and algorithms. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Ecological, coastal, and civil engineering techniques were integrated to
   obtain a structurally sound, ecologically beneficial engineering
   restoration method for preserving the shoreline at Loyola Beach, Kleberg
   County, Texas. The erosion management strategy was based on a plan to
   integrate the natural landscape, riprap rock, and local fill material,
   along with native vegetation for beach preservation. Geotechnical
   parameters including soil moisture, shear strength, plasticity, and
   grain size were measured for pre-construction site characterization and
   baseline evaluations, and compared to measurements for the restored
   areas. The shear strength of the beach after project implementation
   increased along with a decrease in moisture content when compared to the
   original site. Higher shear stress values will be required to reach the
   critical value to cause sediment erosion on the restored structure. A
   model is suggested to estimate erosion potential for these types of
   structures using Shields parameter for sandy soils. The Shields
   parameter calculations predicted an increase in erosion resistance above
   the pre-construction beach soils. The model provides a method to
   evaluate erosion resistance of certain coastal ecosystems based on
   geotechnical analysis techniques. The final project implementation
   provided an economical alternative to conventional coastline
   restoration, costing one-third of a typical seawall, in addition to
   preserving the natural beach ecosystem. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Aim Our aims were to quantify climatic and soil controls on net primary
   productivity (NPP) and leaf area index (LAI) along subtropical to alpine
   gradients where the vegetation remains relatively undisturbed, and
   investigate whether NPP and LAI converge towards threshold-like logistic
   patterns associated with climatic and soil variables that would help us
   to verify and parameterize process models for predicting future
   ecosystem behaviour under global environmental change.
   Location Field data were collected from 22 sites along the Tibetan
   Alpine Vegetation Transects (TAVT) during 1999-2000. The TAVT included
   the altitudinal transect on the eastern slope of the Gongga Mountains in
   the Eastern Tibetan Plateau, with altitudes from 1900 m to 3700 m, and
   the longitudinal-latitudinal transect in the Central Tibetan Plateau, of
   approximately 1000 km length and 40 km width.
   Methods LAI was measured as the product of foliage biomass multiplied by
   the ratio of specific leaf area. NPP in forests and shrub communities
   was estimated as the sum of increases in standing crops of live
   vegetation using recent stem growth rate and leaf lifespan. NPP in
   grasslands was estimated from the above-ground maximum live biomass. We
   measured the soil organic carbon (C) and total and available nitrogen
   (N) contents and their pool sizes by conventional methods. Mean
   temperatures for the year, January and July and annual precipitation
   were estimated from available meteorological stations by interpolation
   or simulation. The threshold-like logistic function was used to model
   the relationships of LAI and NPP with climatic and soil variables.
   Results Geographically, NPP and LAI both significantly decreased with
   increasing latitude (P < 0.02), but increased with increasing longitude
   (P < 0.01). Altitudinal trends in NPP and LAI showed different patterns.
   NPP generally decreased with increasing altitude in a linear
   relationship (r(2) = 0.73, P < 0.001), whereas LAI showed a negative
   quadratic relationship with altitude (r(2) = 0.58, P < 0.001).
   Temperature and precipitation, singly or in combination, explained
   60-68\% of the NPP variation with logistic relationships, while the soil
   organic C and total N variables explained only 21-46\% of the variation
   with simple linear regressions of log-transformed data. LAI showed
   significant logistic relationships with both climatic and soil
   variables, but the data from alpine spruce-fir sites diverged greatly
   from the modelled patterns associated with temperature and
   precipitation. Soil organic C storage had the strongest correlation with
   LAI (r(2) = 0.68, P < 0.001).
   Main conclusions In response to climatic gradients along the TAVT, LAI
   and NPP across diverse vegetation types converged towards threshold-like
   logistic patterns consistent with the general distribution patterns of
   live biomass both above-ground and below-ground found in our earlier
   studies. Our analysis further revealed that climatic factors strongly
   limited the NPP variations along the TAVT because the precipitation
   gradient characterized not only the vegetation distribution but also the
   soil N conditions of the natural ecosystems. LAI generally increased
   with increasing precipitation and was well correlated with soil organic
   C and total N variables. The interaction between LAI growth and soil N
   availability would appear to have important implications for ecosystem
   structure and function of alpine spruce-fir forests. Convergence towards
   logistic patterns in dry matter production of plants in the TAVT
   suggests that alpine plant growth would increase in a nonlinear response
   to global warming.}},

Abstract = {{Aim At a coarse scale, the treelines of the world's mountains seem to
   follow a common isotherm, but the evidence for this has been indirect so
   far. Here we aim at underpinning this with facts.
   Location We present the results of a data-logging campaign at 46
   treeline sites between 68degrees N and 42degrees S.
   Methods We measured root-zone temperatures with an hourly resolution
   over 1-3 years per site between 1996 and 2003.
   Results Disregarding taxon-, landuse- or fire-driven tree limits, high
   altitude climatic treelines are associated with a seasonal mean ground
   temperature of 6.7 degreesC (+/-0.8 SD; 2.2 K amplitude of means for
   different climatic zones), a surprisingly narrow range. Temperatures are
   higher (7-8 degreesC) in the temperate and Mediterranean zone treelines,
   and are lower in equatorial treelines (5-6 degreesC) and in the
   subarctic and boreal zone (6-7 degreesC). While air temperatures are
   higher than soil temperatures in warm periods, and are lower than soil
   temperatures in cold periods, daily means of air and soil temperature
   are almost the same at 6-7 degreesC, a physics driven coincidence with
   the global mean temperature at treeline. The length of the growing
   season, thermal extremes or thermal sums have no predictive value for
   treeline altitude on a global scale. Some Mediterranean (Fagus spp.) and
   temperate South Hemisphere treelines (Nothofagus spp.) and the native
   treeline in Hawaii (Metrosideros) are located at substantially higher
   isotherms and represent genus-specific boundaries rather than boundaries
   of the life-form tree. In seasonal climates, ground temperatures in
   winter (absolute minima) reflect local snow pack and seem uncritical.
   Main conclusions The data support the hypothesis of a common thermal
   threshold for forest growth at high elevation, but also reflect a
   moderate region and substantial taxonomic influence.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud screening of satellite data for the remote sensing of atmospheric
   aerosols, ocean sediments, chlorophyll, and phytoplankton in the marine
   environment is a major problem in the absence of information from
   thermal channel. This is particularly the case with the data from some
   of the highly potential satellite sensors such as the Ocean Colour
   Monitor (OCM-on board the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, IRS-P4) and
   the SeaWiFS. Two main tests conventionally used for cloud screening of
   data from such satellite sensors are the threshold method applied to
   visible and near-IR bands and the visible to near-IR channel ratio
   method. These methods do not have the potential to eliminate the pixels
   with small cloud fractions, leading to overestimation of the aerosol
   optical depth (AOD) derived from satellite data, and might also identify
   the pixels with high values of AOD as cloudy. The purpose of this paper
   is to study the potential of Spatial Coherence Test (SCT) applied to the
   data from the near-IR bands for cloud screening of satellite data over
   the oceanic environment. We use here the data from IRS-P4 OCM. Though
   more computationally intensive, the SCT does not suffer from the serious
   limitations of the threshold and channel ratio methods and is found to
   be superior in identifying the clear sky pixels that are not affected by
   clouds. Although the SCT applied to near-IR channel data may be
   overestimating the number of cloud affected pixels, it neither leads to
   overestimation of AOD nor identifies the pixels with high AOD values as
   cloudy. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental exposure is usually due to the presence of multiple
   chemicals. In most cases, these chemicals interact with each other at
   both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic toxicity mechanisms. In the
   absence of data, joint toxicity assessment of a mixture is based on
   default dose or response additivity. Although, the concept of additivity
   is mostly accepted at low dose levels, these levels need to be
   determined quantitatively to validate the use of additivity as an
   absence of any possible synergistic or antagonistic interactions at low
   environmental exposure levels. The doses at which interaction becomes
   significant define the interaction threshold. In most cases, estimation
   of these low-dose interaction thresholds experimentally is economically
   costly and challenging because of the need to use a large number of
   laboratory animals. Computational toxicology methods provide a feasible
   alternative to establish interaction thresholds. For example, a
   physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to
   estimate an interaction threshold for the joint toxicity between
   chlorpyrifos and parathion in the rat. Initially, PBPK models were
   developed for each chemical to estimate the blood concentrations of
   their respective metabolite. The metabolite concentrations in blood
   out-put was then linked to acetylcholinesterase kinetics submodel. The
   resulting overall PBPK model described interactions between these
   pesticides at two levels in the organism: (a) the P450 enzymatic
   bioactivation site, and (b) acetylcholinesterase binding sites. Using
   the overall model, a response surface was constructed at various dose
   levels of each chemical to investigate the mechanism of interaction and
   to calculate interaction threshold doses. The overall model simulations
   indicated that additivity is obtained at oral dose levels below 0.08
   mg/kg of each chemical. At higher doses, antagonism by enzymatic
   competitive inhibition is the mode of interaction. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Aim To determine the geographical variation in serotiny in a common New
   Zealand shrub as a contemporary indicator of past fire regimes. The
   distribution of serotiny could then be used to explore factors limiting
   the spread of fire-dependent vegetation.
   Location South Island, New Zealand.
   Methods Serotiny was assessed as the proportion of closed capsules on a
   shoot of standard stem diameter for 5-35 plants in 45 widely scattered
   populations of Leptospermum scoparium. Site characteristics, including
   locality, altitude, rainfall, habitat type and minimum burnable area
   were recorded at sampling sites.
   Results Serotiny was distributed bimodally within and among populations
   with capsules either mostly closed or mostly open. There was
   considerable geographical variation in capsule behaviour, most of which
   we attribute to variation in fire history. In wetlands and other sites
   unsuitable for forest growth, populations were all serotinous above a
   minimum area of 30 km(2) and nonserotinous below this threshold. In
   grassy habitats in the drier eastern areas, most populations were
   serotinous. The nonserotinous exceptions occurred in areas thought to
   have been cleared of forests by Polynesian settlers before the arrival
   of Europeans or in areas with numerous barriers to fire in the form of
   large rivers, floodplains, glaciers and barren mountain tops.
   Conclusions we suggest that serotiny in L. scoparium is a reflection of
   a long history of fire in the South Island. As such, it provides a
   contemporary signature of a past fire regime. Landscape barriers to the
   spread of fire were major obstacles limiting the spread of serotiny and
   associated fire-dependent vegetation. Rivers, lakes, glaciers, and
   sparsely vegetated floodplains prevented the spread of fire in high
   rainfall regions more than the lack of dry weather. People, by igniting
   fires in small open areas seldom struck by lightning, could radically
   increase the importance of fire on islands.}},

Abstract = {{In the Daqing region of China there are 34 groundwater well fields with
   a groundwater withdrawal of 81.9x10(4) m(3)/d. Due to over-abstraction
   of the groundwater resources from the 1960s to present, a cone of
   depression up to 4,000 km(2) has formed in the area. To monitor the
   change in the groundwater environment, it is necessary to design an
   effective groundwater-monitoring network. The sites for monitoring
   groundwater level were selected by applying the finite-element method
   coupled with Kalman filtering to the area in which the groundwater
   resources have been extensively exploited. The criterion is a threshold
   value of the standard deviation of estimation error. This threshold
   value is determined by the tradeoff between maximum information and
   minimum cost, in which the maximum information is characterized by the
   standard deviation and the minimum cost is equivalent to the number of
   observation wells. The groundwater flow model was calibrated by an
   optimal algorithm coupled the finite-element method with Kalman
   filtering by using the data from 16 observation wells from 1986 to 1993.
   A simulation algorithm coupled with the finite-element method with
   Kalman filtering analyzed the location data obtained from the existing
   38 observation wells in the same region. The spatial distribution of
   standard deviation of estimation error is computed and the locations
   that have the maximum standard deviation are selected as additional
   sites for augmenting the existing observational well network at a given
   threshold value of the standard deviation surface. Based on the proposed
   method for selecting a groundwater level monitoring network, an optimal
   monitoring network with 88 observation wells with the measurement
   frequency of 12 times per year is selected in the Daqing region of

Abstract = {{Numerous field studies show that changing environmental conditions and

   be applied, we use demographic and environmental data from a trapped
   population of martens (Martes americana) in Ontario to evaluate the
   effect on harvest yield of improvements in prediction of recruitment
   based on fluctuations in its prey base. We conclude that realistic

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{165-170}},
Abstract = {{Goal, Scope and Background. Air pollution has been of a major problem in
   the Pearl River Delta of south China, particularly during the last two
   decades. Emissions of air pollutants from industries have already led to
   damages in natural communities and environments in a wide range of the
   Delta area. Leaf parameters such as chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf area
   (LA), dry weight (DW) and leaf mass per area (LMA) had once been used as
   specific indexes of environmental stress. This study aims to determine
   in situ if the daily variation of chlorophyll fluorescence and other
   ecophysiological parameters in five seedlings of three woody species,
   Ilex rotunda, Ficus microcarpa and Machilus chinensis, could be used
   alone or in combination with other measurements for sensitivity indexes
   to make diagnoses under air pollution stress and, hence, to choose the
   correct tree species for urban afforestation in the Delta area.
   Methods. Five seedlings of each species were transplanted in pot
   containers after their acclimation under shadowing conditions.
   Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were made in situ by a portable
   fluorometer (OS-30, Opti-sciences, U.S.A). Ten random samples of leaves
   were picked from each species for LA measurements by area-meter (CI-203,
   CID, Inc., U.S.A). DW was determined after the leaf samples were dried
   to a constant weight at 65degreesC. LMA was calculated as the ratio of
   DW/LA. Leaf N content,was analyzed according to the Kjeldhal method, and
   the extraction of pigments was carried out according Lin et al.
   Results and Discussion. The daily mean F-v/F-m (F-v is the variable
   fluorescence and F-m is the maximum fluorescence) analysis showed that
   Ilex rotunda and Ficus microcarpa were more highly resistant to
   pollution stress, followed by Machilus chinensis, implying that the
   efficiency of photosystem II in I. rotunda was less affected by air
   pollutants than the other two species. Little difference in daily change
   of F-v/F-m in I. rotunda between the polluted and the clean site was
   also observed. However, a relatively large variation of F-v/F-m appeared
   in the other two species, particularly in M. chinensis, suggesting that
   they were more sensitive to air pollutants than I. rotunda.
   The mean LA was reduced for all species growing at the polluted site.
   The mean LMA for all species exceeded the sclerophylly threshold given
   by Cowling and Campbell and increased for those under pollution stress,
   which could be explained as one of the acclimation strategies for plants
   to air pollution stress.
   Little difference in leaf chlorophyll content was observed in F.
   microcarpa and M. chinensis, while remarkable differences were found in
   I. rotunda growing at the polluted and the clean site. Content of leaf
   carotenoids was largely reduced in I. rotunda growing at the polluted
   site, but increased in E microcarpa and M. chinensis, compared with
   plants growing at the clean site. Plants growing at the clean site had a
   lower leaf N content than those growing at the polluted site. In
   addition, species with a higher resistance to pollution stress showed
   less difference in leaf N content than those sensitive species.
   Conclusion. Based on F-v/F-m. measurements of the three woody species,
   I. rotunda showed the highest resistance to air pollutants from ceramic
   industries, followed by E microcarpa. M. chinensis was the most
   sensitive species to air pollution, had lowest capacities to cope with
   the air pollution stress, which was consistent with visual injury
   symptoms observed in the crown profiles of plants at the polluted site.
   F-v/F-m, LAM, LA, leaf pigments and N content could be used alone or in
   combination to diagnose the extent of the physiological injury. The
   ratio of F-v/F-m, however, was the best and most effective parameter.
   Recommendation and Outlook. Tree species which have higher air-pollutant
   resistance, as diagnosed by such ecophysiological parameters, should be
   considered first and planted widely for urban afforestation or forest
   regeneration in areas where the forest was seriously degraded or forest
   health was markedly effected by the same kind of air pollutants.}},

Title = {{Chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in the Baltic herring
   and sprat of Estonian coastal waters}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{186-193}},
Abstract = {{Background, Aims and Scope. The concentration of chlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in many fish from the Baltic
   requires monitoring, since it approaches or exceeds the European Union
   threshold limit value of 4 pg TEQ/g wet weight of fish for human
   consumption. The concentrations, expressed in TEQs, are important for
   toxicology and regulations, but hide the concentrations of the
   individual congeners, which are important for other environmental
   sciences, source allocation, and for the detection of measurement
   errors. This report evaluates the results of a survey reported earlier
   only in the terms of the TEQ concentrations.
   Methods. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the
   dimensions of the data (17 = 7 chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and 10
   chlorinated dibenzofuran congeners) to three principal components. This
   facilitated the interpretation of the congener profiles. Slopes of the
   congener concentrations as a function of age of the fish were estimated
   by least squares regression. The results were compared with a large set
   of data for lake trout from Lake Ontario.
   Results and Discussion. The congener profiles of Baltic herring are less
   scattered than those of sprat. The profiles of herring from the central
   Baltic differ from those of herring from the Gulf of Riga and both
   appear to be affected relatively minimally by the age of the fish. The
   congener profiles of herring from the western Gulf of Finland are
   similar to those from the central Baltic, those from middle Gulf of
   Finland are similar to those from the Gulf of Riga. Both seem to be more
   affected by age of the fish than the profiles of the first two groups.
   The concentrations of several pentachloro- and
   hexachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans increase with the age of
   the fish.
   Conclusion. PCA is a good technique for the evaluation of the congener
   profiles. The resulting loading and score plots provide a good graphic
   summary of the multidimensional data. Additional analyses are needed to
   confirm the observed profile patterns. A comparison with the results of
   a long-term monitoring from another area shows that the age of the fish
   is a more important factor than the year of capture. Recommendation and
   Outlook. The surveys should continue for a number of years and the
   results should be presented and evaluated both in terms of the TEQs as
   well as in terms of weight concentrations. Since the concentrations do
   not appear to change very much from year to year, it would be better to
   carry out surveys only every 3-4 years and, instead, stratify the
   sampling according to age and gender of the fish, and to analyze
   replicate extracts by replicate measurements. The inclusion of unmarked
   replicate samples would be a good quality assurance measure. It would be
   desirable to analyze additional parts of the food chain in order to
   understand the fate of the compounds in the ecosystem.}},

Title = {{Assessing the efficacy of dredged materials from lake Panasoffkee,
   Florida: Implication to environment and agriculture - Part 1: Soil and
   environmental quality aspect}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{321-326}},
Abstract = {{Background, Aims and Scope. Dredged materials because of its variable
   but unique physical and chemical properties are often viewed by society
   and regulators as pollutants, but many have used these materials in
   coastal nourishment, land or wetland creation, construction materials,
   and for soil improvement as a soil amendment. Environmental impact
   assessment is an important pre-requisite to many dredging initiatives.
   The ability to reuse lake-dredge materials (LDM) for agricultural
   purposes is important because it reduces the need for offshore disposal
   and provides an alternative to disposal of the materials in landfills.
   Additional research on disposal options of dredged materials are much
   needed to supply information on criteria testing and evaluation of the
   physical and chemical impacts of dredged materials at a disposal site,
   as well as information on many other aspects of dredging and dredged
   material disposal. While preliminary efforts are underway to provide
   information to establish criteria for land disposal, testing procedures
   for possible land disposal of contaminated sediments are still in their
   developing stage. The objective of this study (Part 1) was to quantify
   the effect of applied LDM from Lake Panasoffkee (LP), Florida on soil
   physico-chemical properties (soil quality) at the disposal site. This
   series of two papers aims at providing assessment of the efficacy of
   lake-dredged materials from LP especially its implication to environment
   (soil quality, Part 1) and agriculture (forage quality and pasture
   establishment, Part 2).
   Methods. The experimental treatments that were evaluated consisted of
   different ratios of natural soil (NS) to LDM: LDM0 (100\% NS:0\% LDM);
   LDM25 (75\% NS:25\% LDM); LDM50 (50\% NS:50\% LDM); LDM75 (25\% NS:75\%
   LDM); and LDM100 (0\% NS:100\% LDM). Field layout was based on the
   principle of a completely randomized block design with four
   replications. The Mehlich 1 method (0.05 (N) under bar HCl in 0.025 (N)
   under bar H2SO4) was used for chemical extraction of soil. Soil P and
   other exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Al, and Fe) were analyzed using
   an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Spectroscopy. The effects of dredged
   materials addition on soil quality and compaction were analyzed
   statistically following the PROC ANOVA procedures.
   Results and Discussion. Sediments that were dredged from LP have high
   CaCO3 content (82\%) and when these materials were incorporated into
   existing topsoil they would have the same favorable effects as liming
   the field. Thus, sediments with high CaCO3 may improve the physical and
   chemical conditions of subtropical sandy pastures. The heavy and trace
   metal contents of LDM were below the probable effect levels (PEL) and
   threshold effect levels (TEL). Average values for Pb, Zn, As, Cu, Hg,
   Se, Cd, and Ni of 5.2 +/- 1.3, 7.0 +/- 0.6, 4.4 +/- 0.1, 8.7 +/- 1.2,
   0.01 +/- 0.02, 0.02 +/- 0.02, 2.5 +/- 0.1, and 14.6 +/- 6.4 mg kg(-1),
   respectively, were below the TEL and the PEL. TEL represents the
   concentrations of sediment-associated contaminants that are considered
   to cause significant hazards to aquatic organisms, while, PEL represents
   the lower limit of the range of the contaminant concentrations that are
   usually or always associated with adverse biological effects. As such,
   the agricultural or livestock industry could utilize these LDM to
   produce forages. LDM should be regarded as a beneficial resource, as a
   part of the ecological system. Addition of LDM had significant (p less
   than or equal to 0.001) effects on soil physico-chemical properties and
   soil quality. Compared with the control plots, the soils in plots
   amended with LDM exhibited: (1) lower degree of soil compaction; (2) an
   increase in soil pH, Ca, and Mg; (3) decrease in the levels of soil Mn,
   Cu, Fe, Zn, and Si; and (4) no significant change in the level of Na in
   the soil. Results have shown the favorable influence that LDM had on
   soil compaction. The treatment x year interaction effect was not
   significant, but the average soil compaction varied widely (p: 0.001)
   with LDM application. In 2002 and 2003, soil compaction of plots was
   lowered significantly as a result of LDM additions. The least compacted
   soils in 2002 and 2003 were observed from plots with LDM75 with mean
   soil compaction of 300 x 10(3) and 350 x 10(3) Pa, respectively.
   Conclusion. Beneficial uses of dredged materials from LP, Florida are
   both economical and environmental. Often these materials can be obtained
   at little or no cost to the farmers or landowners in south Florida.
   Environmentally, dredging of sediments that are rich in CaCO3 should
   restore the 19.4-sq km LP by removing natural sediments from the lake
   bottom to improve the fishery, water quality, and navigation of the
   lake. The bottom sediment materials from lakes, river, and navigational
   channels usually are composed of upland soil enriched with nutrients and
   organic matter. These materials should be regarded as a beneficial
   resource to be used productively and not to be discarded as spoil
   materials.
   Recommendation and Outlook. Land application of LDM from LP may not only
   provide substantial benefits that will enhance the environment,
   community, and society in south Florida, but also in other parts of the
   world especially those areas having tropical and subtropical climate
   with forage-based beef cattle pastures. The heavy and trace metal
   contents of LDM from LP were below the PEL and TEL. As such, the
   agricultural or livestock industry could utilize these LDM to produce
   forages (Part 2 of this study). LDM should be regarded as a beneficial
   resource, as a part of the ecological system. Further studies are still
   needed to determine whether the environmental and ecological
   implications of LDM application are satisfied over the longer term.}},

Abstract = {{Background, Aims and Scope. Current dredged material disposal
   alternatives have several limitations. Options for dealing with dredged
   materials include leaving them alone, capping them with clean sediments,
   placing them in confined facilities, disposing of them at upland sites,
   treating them chemically, or using them for wetlands creation or other
   beneficial uses The ability to reuse lake-dredge materials (LDM) for
   agricultural purposes is important because it reduces the need for
   offshore disposal and provides an alternative to disposal of the
   materials in landfills. Often these materials can be obtained at little
   or no cost to the farmers or landowners. Thus, forage production offers
   an alternative to waste management since nutrients in the LDM are
   recycled into crops that are not directly consumed by humans. The
   objective of this study (Part 2) were to: (1) assess dredge materials
   from Lake Panasoffkee, Florida as a soil amendment to establish
   bahiagrass (BG) in a subtropical beef cattle pasture in Sumter County,
   Florida; and (2) determine the effect of LDM application on the crude
   protein (CP) and nutrient uptake of BG. This series of two papers aims
   at providing assessment of the efficacy of lake-dredged materials
   especially its implication to environment (soil quality, Part 1) and
   agriculture (forage quality and pasture establishment, Part 2).
   Methods. The experimental treatments that were evaluated consisted of
   different ratios of natural soil (NS) to LDM: LDM0 (100\% NS:0\% LDM);
   LDM25 (75\% NS:25\% LDM); LDM50 (50\% NS:50\% LDM); LDM75 (25\% NS:75\%
   LDM); and LDM100 (0\% NS:100\% LDM). Bahiagrass plots at its early
   establishment were cut to a 5-cm stubble height on Julian days 112 and
   harvested to the same stubble height on Julian days 238 and on Julian
   days 546 following the double-ring method. Field layout was based on the
   principle of a completely randomized block design with four
   replications. Plant samples harvested at 546 Julian days were ground to
   pass through a 1-mm mesh screen in a Wiley mill. Ground forage was
   analyzed for crude protein. Ground forage samples were also analyzed for
   tissue P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Cu, Fe, Al, and Mo concentrations using an ICP
   spectroscopy. The effects of dredged materials addition on forage yield
   and on crude protein and nutrient uptake that were taken at 546 Julian
   days were analyzed statistically following the PROC ANOVA procedures.
   Results and Discussion. Part 1 of this study demonstrated that the heavy
   and trace metal contents of LDM were below the probable effect levels
   and threshold effect levels. As such, the agricultural or livestock
   industry could utilize these LDM to produce forages. Results showed
   consistently and significantly (p less than or equal to 0.001) higher BG
   biomass production and CP from plots amended with LDM than those of BG
   planted on plots with 0\% LDM. Forage yield of BG during its
   establishment increased linearly (Forage Yield = 1724.3 + 25.64{*}LDM;
   R-2 = 0.83; p less than or equal to 0.0001) with increasing rates of LDM
   application. The CP of BG also varied significantly with varying levels
   of LDM applications. The tissues of BG with 100\% LDM had the greatest
   CP content while the lowest CP content was from the control plots
   (LDM0). The CP of BG increased linearly with increasing rates of LDM
   application. The crude protein response to BG application can be
   described by a linear equation: Crude Protein = 10.38 + 0.052{*}LDM; R-2
   = 0.85 p less than or equal to 0.0001. Addition of LDM had increased the
   levels of Ca by about 1811\% when compared with the level of soil Ca
   among plots with no LDM application. Liming the field could have some
   direct and indirect effects on the chemical status of the soils. The
   physiological functions performed by Ca in plants are not clearly
   defined, but it has been suggested that Ca favors the formation of and
   increases the protein content of mitochondria.
   Conclusions. Beneficial uses of dredged materials from LP, Florida are
   both economical and environmental. Often these materials can be obtained
   at little or no cost to the farmers or landowners. Results showed that
   dredged materials can be used as soil amendments (lime and fertilizer)
   for early establishment of BG in beef cattle pastures. Environmentally,
   dredging of sediments that are rich in CaCO3 should restore the 19.4-sq
   Ism LP by removing natural sediments from the lake bottom to improve the
   fishery, water quality, and navigation of the lake. The nutritional
   uptake of BG grown in unfertile sandy soils of Sumter County was
   enhanced significantly (p less than or equal to 0.001) by LDM addition.
   Uptake of TKN, TP, K, Ca, and Mg were remarkably increased as a result
   of LDM.
   Recommendation and Outlook. Land application of LDM from LP may not only
   provide substantial benefits that will enhance the environment,
   community, and society in south Florida, but also in other parts of the
   world especially those areas with forage-based beef cattle pastures and
   similar climatic conditions. The heavy and trace metal contents of these
   materials were below the PEL and TEL (see Part 1). As such, the
   agricultural or livestock industry could utilize these LDM to produce
   forages. LDM should be regarded as a beneficial resource, as a part of
   the ecological system. Although our results have demonstrated the
   favorable and beneficial effects of added LDM on the early establishment
   of BG in pasture fields., further studies are still needed not only in
   pastures of south Florida, but also in other areas with subtropical or
   tropical climatic conditions to determine whether the environmental and
   ecological implications of LDM application are satisfied over the longer
   term.}},

Pages = {{745-752}},
Abstract = {{During a monitoring campaign concentrations of volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) were measured in indoor air of 79 dwellings where
   occupants had not complained about health problems or unpleasant odour.
   Parameters monitored were the individual concentration of 68 VOCs and
   the total concentration of all VOCs inside the room. VOCs adsorbed by
   Tenax TA were then analysed by means of thermal desorption, gas
   chromatography and mass spectrometry. The analytical procedure and
   quantification was done according to the recommendation of the ECA-IAQ
   Working Group 13 which gave a definition of the total volatile organic
   compound (TVOC) concentration. Using this recommendation
   TVOC-concentrations ranged between 33 and 1600 mug m(-3) with a median
   of 289 mug m(-3). Compounds found in every sample and with the highest
   concentrations were 2-propanol, alpha-pinene and toluene. Save for a few
   samples, all concentrations measured have been a factor 2 to 10 lower,
   compared to data from similar studies. Only a few terpenes and aldehydes
   were found exceeding published reference data or odour threshold
   concentrations. However, it has been found that sampling and analysing
   methods do have a considerable impact on the results, making direct
   comparisons of studies somewhat questionable. 47\% of all samples
   revealed concentrations exceeding the threshold value of 300 mug TVOC
   m(-3) set by the German Federal Environmental Agency as a target for
   indoor air quality. Using the TVOC concentration as defined in the
   ECA-IAQ methodology is instrumental in assessing exposure to VOCs and
   identifying sources of VOCs. The background concentrations determined in
   this study can be used to discuss and interpret target values for
   individual and total volatile organic compounds in indoor air.}},

   soils}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{107-113}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is critical need for a practical indicator to assess the potential
   for phosphorus (P) movement from a given site to surface waters, either
   via surface runoff or subsurface drainage. The degree of phosphorus
   saturation (DPS), which relates a measure of P already adsorbed by a
   soil to its P adsorption capacity, could be a good indicator of that
   soil's P release capability. Our primary objective was to rind a
   suitable analytical protocol for determining DPS and to examine the
   possibility of defining a threshold DPS value for Florida's sandy soils.
   Four farmer-owned dairy sprayfields were selected within the Suwannee
   River basin and soil profiles were randomly obtained from each site, as
   well as from adjacent unimpacted sites. The soil samples were divided
   either by horizon or depth, and DPS was determined for each soil sample
   using ammonium-oxalate (DPSOx), Mehlich-1 (DPSM1), and Mehlich-3 (DPSM3)
   extracts. All methods of DPS calculations were linearly related to one
   another (r(2) > 0.94). Relationships between water-soluble P and DPS
   indicate that the respective change points are: DPSOx = 20\%, DPSM1 =
   20\%, and DPSM3 = 16\%. These relationships include samples from Ap, E,
   and Bt horizons, and various combinations thereof, suggesting that DPS
   values can be used as predictors of P loss from a soil irrespective of
   the depth of the soil within a profile. Taking into consideration the
   change points, confidence intervals, agronomic soil test values, and DPS
   values from other studies, we suggest replacing Mehlich-1 P values in
   the Florida P Index with the three DPS categories (DPSM1 = <30, 30-60,
   and >60\%) to assign different P loss ratings in the P Index.}},

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-76}},
Abstract = {{Complex systems, such as landscapes, are composed of different critical
   levels of organization where interactions are stronger within levels
   than among levels, and where each level operates at relatively distinct
   time and spatial scales. To detect significant features occurring at
   specific levels of organization in a landscape, two steps are required.
   First, a multiscale dataset must be generated from which these features
   can emerge. Second, a procedure must be developed to delineate
   individual image-objects and identify them as they change through scale.
   In this paper, we introduce a framework for the automatic definition of
   multiscale landscape features using object-specific techniques and
   marker-controlled watershed segmentation. By applying this framework to
   a high-resolution satellite scene, image-objects of varying size and
   shape can be delineated and studied individually at their characteristic
   scale of expression. This framework involves three main steps: 1)
   multiscale dataset generation using an object-specific analysis and
   upscaling technique, 2) marker-controlled watershed transformation to
   automatically delineate individual image-objects as they evolve through
   scale, and 3) landscape feature identification to assess the
   significance of these image-objects in terms of meaningful landscape
   features. This study was conducted on an agro-forested region in
   southwest Quebec, Canada, using IKONOS satellite data. Results show that
   image-objects tend to persist within one or two scale domains, and then
   suddenly disappear at the next, while new image-objects emerge at
   coarser scale domains. We suggest that these patterns are associated to
   sudden shifts in the entire image structure at certain scale domains,
   which may correspond to critical landscape thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{A standard method for measuring and quantifying odour in the ambient air
   utilizes a portable odour detecting and measuring device known as a
   field olfactometer (US Public Health Service Project Grant A-58-541).
   The field olfactometer dynamically dilutes the ambient air with
   carbon-filtered air in distinct ratios known as
   ``Dilutions-to-Threshold{''} dilution factors (D/Ts), i.e. 2, 4, 7, 15,
   etc. Thirteen US states and several cities in North America currently
   utilize field olfactometry as a key component of determining compliance
   to odour regulations and ordinances. A controlled environmental chamber
   was utilized, with hydrogen sulfide as the known test odorant. A
   hydrogen sulfide environment was created in this controlled chamber
   using an Advanced Calibration Designs, Inc. Cal2000 Hydrogen Sulfide
   Generator. The hydrogen sulfide concentration inside the chamber was
   monitored using an Arizona Instruments, Inc. Jerome Model 631 H2S
   Analyzer. When the environmental chamber reached a desired test
   concentration, test operators entered the chamber. The
   dilution-to-threshold odour concentration was measured using a Nasal
   Ranger Field Olfactometer (St Croix Sensory, Inc.) and a Barnebey
   Sutcliffe Corp. Scentometer. The actual hydrogen sulfide concentration
   was also measured at the location in the room where the operators were
   standing while using the two types of field olfactometers. This paper
   presents a correlation between dilution-to-threshold values (D/T) and
   hydrogen sulfide ambient concentration. For example, a D/T of 7
   corresponds to ambient H2S concentrations of 5.7-15.6 mug/m(3) (4-11
   ppbv). During this study, no significant difference was found between
   results obtained using the Scentometer or the Nasal Ranger(R) (r =
   0.82). Also, no significant difference was found between results of
   multiple Nasal Ranger(R) users (p = 0.309). The field olfactometers
   yielded hydrogen sulfide thresholds of 0.7-3.0 mug/m(3) (0.5-2.0 ppbv).
   Laboratory olfactometry yielded comparable thresholds of 0.64-1.3
   mug/m(3) (0.45-0.9 ppbv). These thresholds are consistent with published
   values.}},

Abstract = {{Various types of toxicity classification systems have been elaborated by
   scientists in different countries, with the aim of attributing a hazard
   score to polluted environments or toxic waste-waters or of ranking them
   in accordance with increasing levels of toxicity. All these systems are
   based on batteries of standard acute toxicity tests (several of them
   including chronic assays as well) and are therefore dependent on the
   culturing and maintenance of live stocks of test organisms. Most systems
   require performance of the bioassays on dilution series of the original
   samples, for subsequent calculation of L(E)C-50 or threshold toxicity
   values. Given the complexity and costs of these toxicity measurements,
   they can only be applied in well-equipped and highly specialized
   laboratories, and none of the classification methods so far has found
   general acceptance at the international level. The development of
   microbiotests that are independent of continuous culturing of live
   organisms has stimulated international collaboration. Coordinated at
   Ghent University, Belgium, collaboration by research groups from 10
   countries in central and eastern Europe resulted in an alternative
   toxicity classification system that was easier to apply and
   substantially more cost effective than any of the earlier methods. This
   new system was developed and applied in the framework of a cooperation
   agreement between the Flemish community in Belgium and central and
   eastern Europe. The toxicity classification system is based on a battery
   of (culture-independent) microbiotests and is particularly suited for
   routine monitoring. It indeed only requires testing on undiluted samples
   of natural waters or wastewaters discharged into the aquatic
   environment, except for wastewaters that demonstrate more than 50\%
   effect. The scoring system ranks the waters or wastewaters in 5 classes
   of increasing hazard/toxicity, with calculation of a weight factor for
   the concerned hazard/toxicity class. The new classification system was
   applied during 2000 by the participating laboratories on samples of
   river water, groundwaters, drinking waters, mine waters, sediment pore
   waters, industrial effluents, soil leachates, and waste dump leachates
   and was found to be easy to apply and reliable. (C) 2003 Wiley

Abstract = {{The cohort development of poikilotherms under favorable temperature
   conditions may be described by the time-invariant distributed delay
   models that require three parameters, i.e. the thermal threshold T-0,
   the thermal constant W and the variability parameter H representing
   distributed maturation times, also known as time distributed or
   stochastic development. Here, a parsimonious method is developed that
   uses stage-frequency matrices obtained under controlled conditions. The
   analysis of these matrices permits the estimation of the three
   parameters, while the incorporation of both developmental threshold and
   thermal constant into the time-invariant distributed delay model permits
   the representation of stochastic cohort development under constant
   temperatures. The evaluated parameters can also be used in time-varying
   distributed delay models that are particularly useful for a wide range
   of fluctuating temperature conditions.
   We consider stage-frequency matrices obtained from cohorts of eggs and
   larvae of Oulema duftschmidi Redthenbacher at different constant

Abstract = {{This article deals with the interrelation of ecological and economic
   aspects through the use of indicators. Two aspects are painted out: the
   first being the measurement of the economic value of ecological
   services, and the second being the integration of economic aspects into
   comprehensive indicator systems.
   The measurement of the economic value provides a means of determining
   consumer-orientated values of landscapes and bio-diversity issues. This
   measurement, however, is viewed critically by some, especially in nature
   conservancy circles. For them the intrinsic values of a landscape, which
   cannot be measured in economic terms, play the central role in the
   assessment of landscapes {[}Oekonomische Bewertungsgrundlagen und die
   Grenzen einer `Monetarisierung' der Natur. In: Theobald, W. (Ed.),
   Integrative Umweltbewertung. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, pp.95-117].
   On the other hand, Braeuers {[}Money as an indicator: to make use of
   economic evaluation for biodiversity conservation. In: Buechs, W. (Ed.),
   Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric.
   Ecosys. Environ.], whose article presents an overview of current
   economic assessment methods, provides an alternate point of view.
   Braeuer {[}Money as an indicator: to make use of economic evaluation for
   biodiversity conservation. In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for
   Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ.]
   argues that through the inclusion of monetary values into the assessment
   process the whole issue can remain on a factual level. The article by
   Gerowitt et al. {[}Rewards for ecological goods-requirements and
   perspectives for agricultural land use. In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic
   Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst.
   Environ.] even goes further and suggests that a market oriented system
   be implemented for environmental goods.
   In contrast to the subjective measurement of economic value, land use
   models are based on ``objective{''} expertise. Aim of the articles in
   this sector is to analyse the enhancement of scientific models by
   economic aspects. These models would then be used to verify the
   feasibility of ecological motivated land use claims. The results would
   form the basis for political decision making by a society. The model of
   Meyer-Aurich and Zander {[}Consideration of biotic environmental quality

   reviews land use decision making on the operational level, while the
   model of Herrmann et al. {[}Threshold values for nature protection areas

   ecological consequences. In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for
   Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ.]

Abstract = {{Aim To determine the factors influencing the distribution of birds in
   remnants in a fragmented agricultural landscape. Location Forty-seven
   eucalypt remnants and six sites in continuous forest in the sub-humid
   Midlands region of Tasmania, Australia.
   Methods Sites were censused over a two-year period, and environmental
   data were collected for remnants. The avifauna of the sites was
   classified and ordinated. The abundances of bird species, and bird
   species composition, richness, abundance and diversity were related to
   environmental variables, using simple correlation and modelling.
   Results There were two distinct groups of sample sites, which sharply
   differed in species composition, richness, diversity and bird abundance,
   separated on the presence/absence of noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala
   Latham) colonies, remnant size, vegetation structural attributes and
   variables that reflected disturbance history. The approximate remnant
   size threshold for the change from one group to another was 20-30 ha.
   Remnant species richness and diversity were most strongly explained by
   remnant area and noisy miner abundance, with contributions from
   structural and isolation attributes in the second case. Segment richness
   was explained by precipitation, logging history and noisy miner
   abundance. Bird abundance was positively related to precipitation and
   negatively related to tree dieback. The 28 individual bird species
   models were highly individualistic, with vegetation structural
   variables, noisy miner abundance, climatic variables, variables related
   to isolation, area, variables related to floristics, disturbance
   variables, the nature of the matrix and remnant shape all being
   components in declining order of incidence. Age of the remnant did not
   relate to any of the dependent variables.
   Main conclusions Degraded and small remnants may have become more
   distinct in their avifaunal characteristics than might otherwise be the
   case, as a result of the establishment of colonies of an aggressive
   native bird, the noisy miner. The area, isolation and shape of remnants
   directly relate to the abundance of relatively few species, compared to
   vegetation attributes, climate and the abundance of the noisy miner. The
   nature of the matrix is important in the response of some species to
   fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{We are concerned with the management of ecological and economic systems
   with threshold responses and with several time scales. Although optimal
   control of such systems is Seldom attainable, the form of such optimal
   controls provides important insights for more practical schemes. Here we
   optimize the expected discounted net benefits of phosphorus (P) loadings
   for a potentially eutrophic lake. The benefits accrue to agricultural
   interests from activities that result in loading, and costs accrue to
   other interests from the resulting deterioration of water quality. We
   extend the 1999 results of S. R. Carpenter, D. Ludwig, and W. A. Brock
   to account for dependence of P recycling upon the concentration of P in
   sediments. We obtain optimal policies using methods of dynamic
   programming with two state variables.
   We find a strong interaction between economic and ecological parameters
   in determining the optimal policy: the economic discount rate determines
   whether the time horizon is long or short, and this in turn strongly
   influences the magnitude of the optimal loadings. Simple policies that
   neglect dynamics of P in the sediments are inadequate unless the time
   horizon is short and the dynamics are slow. A stochastic model is
   essential if there are substantial random fluctuations in loadings.
   Uncertainty in the determination of the critical P density that triggers
   recycling cannot be neglected. Our results may be interpreted as a
   quantitative precautionary principle that takes account of both economic
   and ecological aspects of the management of the lake. Our results may
   also be used to illustrate economic ideas such as sustainable
   development, natural capital, option,values, and income.}},

Abstract = {{Millions of children are exposed to low levels of environmental
   neurotoxicants as their brains are developing. Conventional laboratory
   methods of neurotoxicology can detect maldevelopment of brain structure
   but are not designed to detect maldevelopment of the brain's capacity
   for plasticity that could impair learning throughout life. The
   environmental complexity (EC) paradigm has become classic for
   demonstrating the modifications in brain structure that occur in
   response to experience and thus provides a set of indices for plasticity
   in the healthy brain. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that
   if degradation of experience-dependent cortical plasticity is used as a
   biomarker, then developmental neurotoxic effects will be detected at
   doses below those that alter cortical morphogenesis overtly. Pregnant
   Long-Evans hooded rats received a single injection of either saline
   vehicle or 1, 5, 10, or 25 mg/kg of the well-characterized developmental
   neurotoxicant methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) on the 16th or 17th day
   of gestation. On postnatal days 35-39, mate offspring were assigned to
   either a complex environment (EC) or an individual cage (IC) for 28 days
   to stimulate neuroanatomical plasticity. This response was measured as
   the difference between the thickness of visual cortex of IC and EC
   littermates at a given dose. The threshold dose for significant
   reduction of cortical thickness was 25 mg/kg, but the threshold dose for
   failure of plasticity was much lower and could be detected at I mg/kg,
   the lowest dose used. No other method of assessment has detected lasting
   effects of prenatal exposure to MAM at such a low dose. These data
   suggest that this simple test of plasticity could be an efficient way to
   detect subtle neurotoxic damage to the developing brain.}},

Abstract = {{Of the three ``pillars{''} of risk assessment identified in the Red

   since the publication of the Red Book, progress in dose-response
   assessment has not kept pace with those in the other elements of risk
   assessment. Today dose-response assessment is being performed in a
   manner very similar to the way it was being performed 20 years ago, with
   dissimilar methods being applied to chemicals considered to operate by
   ``linear{''} and ``non-linear{''} (or ``threshold{''}) mechanisms, and
   often rancorous debate over which mechanism applies to a particular

   state of affairs, suggestions are made herein for an approach to
   dose-response assessment that would treat chemicals in a more consistent
   manner and would better reflect the true state of scientific knowledge
   regarding low-dose risks. The method involves applying quantitative
   methods at higher doses where quantification is more reliable, and then
   employing safety factors based upon scientific judgment to establish
   exposure guidelines. In addition to the traditional uncertainties

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of the exposure-response relationship between
   environmental particulate air pollution and mortality is important from
   both an etiologic and regulatory perspective. However, little is known
   about the actual shapes of these exposure-response curves. The objective
   of this study was to estimate the exposure-response relationships
   between mortality and long-term average city-specific levels of sulfates
   and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We reanalyzed the data derived from
   the American Cancer Society (ACS) Cancer Prevention Study II, a large
   prospective study conducted in the United States between 1982 and 1989.
   Exposure to particulate air pollution was assessed prior to entry into
   the cohort. Mean sulfate concentrations for 1980 were available in 151
   cities, and median PM2.5 levels between 1979 and 1983 were available in
   50 cities. Two sampling strategies were employed to reduce the
   computational burden. The modified case-cohort approach combined a
   random subcohort of 1200 individuals with an additional 1300 cases
   (i.e., deaths). The second strategy involved pooling the results of
   separate analyses of 10 disjoint random subsets, each with about 2200
   participants. To assess the independent effect of the particulate levels
   on all-causes mortality, we relied on flexible, nonparametric survival
   analytical methods. To eliminate potentially restrictive assumptions
   underlying the conventional models, we employed a flexible regression
   spline generalization of the Cox proportional-hazards (PH) model. The
   regression spline method allowed us to model simultaneously the
   time-dependent changes in the effect of particulate matter on the hazard
   and a possibly nonlinear exposure-response relationship. The PH and
   linearity hypotheses were tested using likelihood ratio tests. In all
   analyses, we stratified by age and 5-yr age groups and adjusted for the
   subject's age, lifetime smoking exposure, obesity, and education. For
   both fine particles (PM2.5) and sulfates, there was a statistically
   significant (at .05 level) departure from the conventional linearity
   assumption. The adjusted effect of fine particles on mortality indicated
   a stronger relationship in the lower (up to about 16 mug/m(3)) than in
   the higher range of their values. increasing levels of sulfates in the
   lower range (up to about 12 mug/m(3)) had little impact on mortality,
   suggesting a possible ``no-effect threshold.{''} For body mass index
   (BMI), the risks were lowest in the middle range and increased for both
   very obese and very lean individuals. It was concluded that flexible
   modeling yields new insights about the effect of long-term air pollution
   on mortality.}},

   decrease in fall season. These changes in seasonal streamflow
   characteristics indicate a hydrologic regime shift toward early snowmelt
   and higher summer streamflow perhaps due to regional climate warming and
   permafrost degradation in the southern parts of Siberia. The results
   also demonstrate that reservoir regulations have significantly altered
   the monthly discharge regime in the lower parts of Lena River basin.
   Because of a large dam in west Lena River, summer (high) flows at the
   outlet of the Vilui valley have been reduced by up to 55\% and winter
   (low) flows have been increased by up to 30 times. These alterations,
   plus streamflow changes in the upper Lena regions, lead to strong upward
   trends (up to 90\%) in monthly discharge at the basin outlet during the
   low-flow months and weak increases (5-10\%) in the high-flow season.
   Monthly flow records at the basin outlet have been reconstructed by a
   regression method to reduce reservoir impacts. Trend analyses and
   comparisons between the observed and reconstructed monthly flows show
   that because of reservoir regulations, discharge records observed at the
   Lena basin outlet do not always represent natural changes and
   variations. They tend to underestimate the natural runoff trends in
   summer and overestimate the trends in both winter and fall seasons.
   Therefore the cold season discharge increase identified at the mouth of
   the Lena basin is not all naturally caused, but the combined effect of
   reservoir regulation and natural runoff changes in the unregulated upper
   subbasins. This study clearly illustrates the importance of human
   activities in regional and global environment changes and points to a
   need to examine human impacts in other large high-latitude watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are commonly used in the
   biomedical field to assess the quality of a diagnostic test. The area
   under an ROC curve, which ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, is a measure of the
   overall effectiveness of a diagnostic test. These curves can be used to
   elucidate compromises in sensitivity (ability to correctly classify a
   toxic sample as toxic) and specificity (ability to correctly classify a
   nontoxic sample as nontoxic) associated with a given threshold. In this
   study, ROC curves were used to evaluate methods for estimating acute
   toxicity of metals in marine sediments. Differences in the effectiveness
   of speciation (comparisons of labile sulfides with simultaneously
   extracted metals) and total sediment concentration (such as the National
   Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Guidelines, Washington, DC)
   approaches were assessed by using a database of field and laboratory
   spiked sediments. Despite uncertainties associated with these methods,
   the areas under the ROC curves ranged from 0.84 to 0.89 for all
   approaches tested, with no significant differences between speciation
   and whole sediment approaches. Thresholds commonly used by environmental
   managers, although yielding high sensitivity, came at the expense of low
   specificity. Thresholds providing desirable trade-offs in sensitivity
   and specificity generally are higher than commonly used thresholds.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Aim Anecdotal historical and photographic evidence suggests that woody
   vegetation is increasing dramatically in some northern Australian
   savanna habitats. Vegetation change in savannas has important
   implications for pastoral land-use, conservation management, and
   landscape-scale carbon storage, and informs theoretical debates about
   ecosystem function. This study seeks to determine the nature, extent and
   cause(s) of woody vegetation change in a seasonally flooded alluvial
   savanna habitat.
   Location The study area is located within the seasonally inundated
   alluvial zone of the tidal portion of the Victoria River, Northern
   Territory, Australia. The study area has been grazed by domestic stock
   since c. 1900, prior to which the area was inhabited and more likely
   regularly burnt by Aboriginal people for thousands of years.
   Methods Digital georeferenced aerial photographic coverages were used to
   examine and quantify woody vegetation change between 1948 and 1993.
   Transect surveys of woody and herbaceous vegetation were carried out to
   ground-truth air-photo results and determine the nature and causes of
   observed vegetation changes.
   Results There has been a dramatic increase in woody vegetation cover
   throughout the study area. Vegetation change patterns are roughly
   uniform across the full range of edaphic habitat variation and are
   unrelated to the depositional age of fluvial sediments. Two woody
   species, Eucalyptus microtheca and Excoecaria parvifolia, are
   predominantly responsible for observed increases. Demographic analyses
   reveal that woody invasions have been episodic and indicate that in most
   locations peak woody species establishment occurred in the mid-1970s.
   Grasses are almost absent in a majority of habitats within the study
   area. Instead, large areas are covered by scalded soil, dense invasive
   weed populations, and unpalatable forbs and sedges. What grasses do
   occur are predominantly of very low value for grazing. The condition of
   the herbaceous layer renders most of the study area almost completely
   non-flammable; what fires do burn are small and of low intensity.
   Main conclusions Multiple working hypotheses explaining observed
   patterns of woody vegetation increase were considered and rejected in
   turn. The only hypothesis consistent with the evidence is as follows:
   (1) observed changes are a direct consequence of extreme overgrazing by
   cattle, most likely when stocking rates peaked in the mid-1970s; (2)
   prolonged heavy grazing effected the complete transformation of much of
   the herbaceous vegetation to a new state that is not flammable; and (3)
   in the absence of regular fire mortality, woody vegetation increased
   rapidly. The relatively treeless system that existed in 1948 was
   apparently stable and resilient to moderate grazing levels, and perhaps
   also to episodic heavy grazing events. However, grazing intensity in
   excess of a sustainable threshold has forced a transition that is
   irreversible in the foreseeable future. Stable-state transitions such as
   this one inform debates at the heart of ecological theory, such as the
   nature of stability, resilience, equilibrium and carrying capacity in
   dynamic savanna ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{For some time now, ecological economists have been putting forward a
   `threshold hypothesis'-the notion that when macroeconomic systems expand
   beyond a certain size, the additional cost of growth exceeds the flow of
   additional benefits. In order to support their belief, ecological
   economists have developed a number of similar indexes to measure and
   compare the benefits and costs of growth (e.g. the Index of Sustainable
   Economic Welfare, ISEW, and the Genuine Progress Indicator, GPI). In
   virtually every instance where an index of this type has been calculated
   for a particular country, the movement of the index appears to reinforce
   the existence of the threshold hypothesis. Of late, a number of
   observers have cast doubt over the validity of these alternative
   indexes. One of the concerns commonly expressed is the supposed lack of
   a theoretical foundation to support the ISEW, the GPI, and other related
   indexes. By adopting a concept of income and capital outlined by Fisher
   (Nature of Capital and Income. A. M. Kelly, New York, 1906), this paper
   demonstrates that these alternative indexes are theoretically sound but,
   in order to be broadly accepted, require the continuous development of
   more robust valuation methods. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the relative roles of the human health hazard index
   (HI) and the ecological risk assessment hazard quotient (HQ) in remedial
   decision-making. Through an analysis of HI outcomes drawn from Superfund
   Records of Decision, the reduced importance of the HI statistic in human
   health risk assessments is demonstrated, and the high visibility of the
   ecological risk assessment (ERA) HQ for terrestrial receptors (birds and
   mammals) is underscored. Three HQ method limitations common to both HHRA
   and ERA, deriving either from the mathematical construct of the HQ (a
   simple binary measure, indicating that an animal's exposure either
   exceeds its toxicity value or does not) or from dose-response outcomes
   in animal trials, are reviewed. Two additional HQ limitations unique to
   ERA (i.e., a propensity for the HQ to easily exceed its threshold value,
   and a propensity for it to assume values that are unreasonably high),
   and deriving from the complexities of estimating bird and mammal dietary
   intakes of contaminants and the availability of toxicological effects
   information, are also identified. The paper cautions of the potential to
   err in concluding that terrestrial site receptors are at risk when the
   HQ threshold is exceeded, and regardless of the toxicological
   information (NOAELs, LOAELs, etc.) used. It recognizes that because
   other methods of terrestrial assessment are presently unavailable, HQs
   are sometimes, out of necessity, used to justify a remedial action. The
   analysis and discussion are intended to remind ecological risk assessors
   that the HQ is a measure of a level of concern only and not a measure of
   risk.}},

Abstract = {{Present critical levels for ozone (O-3) for protecting vegetation
   against adverse effects are based on exposure-response relationships
   mainly derived from open-top chamber experiments and are expressed as an
   Accumulated exposure Over a Threshold of 40 ppb (AOT40). In that context
   with a revision of the UN (United Nations)-ECE (Economic Commission for
   Europe) Gothenburg protocol, AOT40 values should be replaced by
   flux-oriented quantities, i.e. in the end by critical loads. At present,
   the database for the derivation of critical loads for O-3 is extremely
   inadequate. Furthermore, the currently available flux-response
   relationships are also derived from open-top chamber experiments. The
   use of a relationship for spring wheat in a risk assessment for an
   agricultural site in Hesse, Germany, demonstrates in principle, the
   applicability of the critical load concept for O-3. Comparisons of
   diurnal variation of stomatal uptake and AOT40 showed that a major part
   of toxicologically effective stomatal uptake occurred before noon
   whereas the AOT40 values were dominated by the O-3 concentrations during
   afternoon. In other words, the AOT40 exposure index do not adequately
   address the O-3 burden during hours when plants are sensitive to O-3
   uptake. However, due to the differences in radiation, air temperature
   and humidity between the chamber and the ambient microclimates, a
   derivation of flux-response relationships from chamber experiments is
   likely to be questionable, especially for species rich ecosystems: Here,
   without any changes in the pollution climate, significant modifications
   of species composition as well as an earlier beginning of the growing
   season has been previously observed. To overcome the problems associated
   with chamber-derived flux-response relationships, a new experimental and
   modelling concept, was developed. The approach, briefly described in
   this paper, combines methods in air pollution toxicology and
   micrometeorology. As an analogy to the free-air fumigation concept, O-3
   is released into the air by an injection system above the plant canopy.
   The assessment of dispersion and surface deposition Of O-3 released is
   based on Lagrangian trajectory modelling. Depending on wind direction
   and velocity, atmospheric stratification and surface roughness, without
   any disturbance of the microclimate and micrometeorology, several
   sub-areas can be identified around the source position with differing
   deposition rates above the ambient level. Taking into account the actual
   O-3 background deposition, deposition rates and vegetation responses
   observed in these sub-areas can easily be used to derive flux-effect
   relationships under ambient conditions and more realistic limiting
   values to protect our environment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   compares and analyses 12 indicator-based approaches to assessing

   methods take into account a number of environmental objectives (e.g.

   the degree to which these objectives are attained. A total of 26
   objectives were taken into account by one or several of the methods. A
   great diversity in breadth of analysis exists: the number of objectives

   based on the environmental effects of farmer practices are preferable to
   indicators based on farmer practices as the link with the objective is

   on farmer practices cost less in data collection but do not allow an
   actual evaluation of environmental impact. Indicators allowing
   expression of impacts both per unit surface and per unit product are
   preferable. Indicators producing output in the form of values are
   preferred to indicators producing scores. If possible, science-based

Abstract = {{In 1998 the American Conference for Governmental Industrial Hygienists
   (ACGIH) proposed size selective sampling for wood dust based on the
   inhalable fraction. Thus the proposed threshold limit values (TLVs)
   require the use of a sampler whose performance matches the inhalable
   convention. The Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) sampler has
   shown good agreement with the inhalable convention under controlled
   conditions, and the Button sampler, developed by the University of
   Cincinnati, has shown reasonable agreement in at least one laboratory
   study. The Button sampler has not been previously evaluated under wood
   working conditions, and the IOM has been shown to sample more mass than
   expected when compared to the standard closed-face cassette, which may
   be due to the collection of very large particles in wood working
   environments. Some projectile particles may be > 100 mum aerodynamic
   diameter and thus outside the range of the convention. Such particles,
   if present, can bias the estimates of concentration considerably. This
   study is part of an on-going research focus into selecting the most
   appropriate inhalable sampler for use in these industries, and to
   examine the impact of TLV changes. This study compared gravimetric
   analyses (National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Method
   0500) of side-by-side personal samples using the Button, IOM, and 37 mm
   closed-face cassette (CFC) under field-use conditions. A total of 51
   good sample pairs were collected from three wood products industries
   involved in the manufacturing of cabinets, furniture, and shutters.
   Paired t-tests were run on each sample pair using Statistical Package
   for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 10. The IOM and the CFC measured
   statistically different concentrations (p < 0.0005, n = 16). The IOM and
   Button measured statistically different concentrations (p = 0.020, n =
   12). The Button and CFC did not measure statistically different
   concentrations of wood dust (p = 0.098, n = 23). Sampler ratios for
   IOM/CFC pairs ranged from 1.19-19 (median 3.35). Sampler ratios for
   IOM/Button pairs ranged from 0.49 +/- 163 (median 3.15). Sampler ratios
   for CFC/Button pairs ranged from 0.36-27 (median 1.2). In all cases,
   higher ratios were associated with higher concentrations. The median
   relative difference between the IOM's and CFC's is in accord with prior
   field studies in woodworking environments, and, taken together, the data
   imply a conversion factor greater than the 2.5 normally applied to CFC
   results to approximate inhalable values, as measured by the IOM. Raising
   the limit values by approximately 50\% appears warranted for this
   particular situation of inhalable wood dust measured by the IOM. The
   IOM/Button and CFC/Button ratios were unexpectedly low, which may be due
   to the exclusion of very large particles, collected by the IOM and CFC
   samplers. Further work is required to explain these results.}},

Abstract = {{As the concepts of landscape ecology have been incorporated into other

   distribution has attracted considerable attention. However, there
   remains a significant gap in the application of landscape ecology
   theories and techniques to wildlife research. By combining landscape
   ecology techniques with traditional wildlife habitat analysis methods,
   we defined an `organism-centered perspective' for breeding bald eagles
   (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) along the Hudson River, New York, USA. We
   intensively monitored four pairs of breeding eagles during the 1999 and
   2000 breeding seasons, and collected detailed information on perch and
   forage locations. Our analysis focused on three critical habitat
   elements: available perch trees, access to foraging areas, and freedom
   from human disturbance. We hypothesized that eagle habitat selection
   relative to each of these elements would vary with the spatial scale of
   analysis, and that these scaling relationships would vary among habitat
   elements. We investigated two elements of spatial scale: grain and local
   extent. Grain was defined as the minimum mapping unit; local extent was
   defined by the size of an analysis window placed around each focal
   point. For each habitat element, we quantified habitat use over a range
   of spatial scales. Eagles displayed scale-dependent patterns of habitat
   use in relation to all habitat features, including multi-scale and
   threshold-like patterns. This information supports the existence of
   scale-dependant relationships in wildlife habitat use and allowed for a

   (Q(max)) and strength (K) of the soil, and the total range in STP. In
   turn, this affects the calculation of a threshold in STP. The q-i
   relationship tends towards linearity under conditions of a narrow total
   range of STP and/or when using a wide soil to solution ratio for
   estimating the P intensity parameter. Under such conditions, a threshold
   is difficult to detect, and uncertain.
   We conclude that the sensitivity of thresholds to experimental
   conditions and soils needs to be considered if thresholds are to be
   successful in environmental management to decrease P loss to surface
   waters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use and utility of the no observed effect concentration (NOEL) in
   ecological risk assessment is a contentious issue. One concern is that
   the NOEC is not representative of a concentration at which no
   biologically significant effect is occurring. A new method has been
   developed to estimate the threshold of toxicity, or a true NOEC, for
   aquatic plants. The method involves determining the effective
   concentration (ECx) of a number of endpoints from one species. These ECx
   values are plotted on a log-probability scale. The x-intercept, or a low
   centile, of the distribution can be interpreted as the threshold of
   toxicity for that plant at that response level. This threshold is the
   concentration at which no effects should be observed for any endpoint
   above that response level. It is based on the assumptions that multiple
   effect measures from a single species will be log-normally distributed
   and that the distribution contains all possible endpoints for that
   species. The thresholds and the distributions can then be used as a
   substitute for the NOEC or ECx in risk assessment techniques, such as
   hazard quotients and probabilistic ecological risk assessment. This new
   method of estimating toxicity thresholds is more realistic than the use
   of arbitrary uncertainty factors, is more conservative than current
   probabilistic risk assessment methods, allows for simple comparison
   between species and exposure duration to a toxicant, and may be useful
   for assessing mixture toxicity. This technique was applied to field
   derived data with Lemna gibba, Myriophyfum spicatum, and M. sibiricum to
   assess potential risks from monochloroacetic acid (MCA). Using this new
   risk assessment method, we conclude that MCA does not appear to pose a
   risk to aquatic macrophytes under field conditions at current
   environmental concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Many ecological studies require analysis of collections of estimates.
   For example, population change is routinely estimated for many species
   from surveys such as the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), and
   the species are grouped and used in comparative analyses. We developed a
   hierarchical model for estimation of group attributes from a collection
   of estimates of population trend. The model uses information from
   predefined groups of species to provide a context and to supplement data
   for individual species; summaries of group attributes are improved by
   statistical methods that simultaneously analyze collections of trend
   estimates. The model is Bayesian; trends are treated as random variables
   rather than fixed parameters. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
   methods to fit the model. Standard assessments of population stability
   cannot distinguish magnitude of trend and statistical significance of
   trend estimates, but the hierarchical model allows us to legitimately
   describe the probability that a trend is within given bounds. Thus we
   define population stability in terms of the probability that the
   magnitude of population change for a species is less than or equal to a
   predefined threshold. We applied the model to estimates of trend for 399
   species from the BBS to estimate the proportion of species with
   increasing populations and to identify species with unstable
   populations. Analyses are presented for the collection of all species
   and for 12 species groups commonly used in BBS summaries. Overall, we
   estimated that 49\% of species in the BBS have positive trends and 33
   species have unstable populations. However, the proportion of species
   with increasing trends differs among habitat groups, with grassland
   birds having only 19\% of species, with positive trend estimates and
   wetland birds having 68\% of species with positive trend estimates.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to clarify the mechanisms underlying
   the expression of phenotypic plasticity in Daphnia life history traits
   in response to fish kairomone and to explore how these mechanisms
   interact with genetic variation for life history traits. I studied the
   effect of fish kairomone on life history traits in 16 Daphnia galeata
   clones. Maturation occurred more often at the earlier instars in
   response to the fish treatment, resulting in earlier age and smaller
   size at maturity. The changes in age and size at maturity which occurred
   in the response to the fish treatment could be attributed to a large
   extent to this shift. In addition, fish kairomone resulted in smaller
   instar increments after the maturation process was initiated, but not
   during the juvenile period. Within groups of animals maturing at the
   same instar, larger size at birth resulted in larger size at maturity,
   but had no effect on age at maturity. However, larger size at birth
   brought about earlier maturity because animals which were larger at
   birth matured more often at the earlier instar. Fish treatment resulted
   in more, but smaller, offspring in the first clutch relative to the size
   of the mother. Genetic variation was found in all measured life history
   traits. Genetic variation in plasticities of life history traits was not
   detectable by standard methods, and was only shown when the above
   mechanisms of expression of life history traits were taken into account.
   This study illustrates the importance of a thorough understanding of the
   mechanisms underlying the expression of life history traits, in this
   case, sources and consequences of maturation in the multiple instars.
   Not only is this necessary to predict the long-term effect of the
   environment, but also to understand the response of life history traits
   and their plasticities to natural selection. Electronic supplementary

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We revisit the assumptions associated with the derivation and
   application of species sensitivity distributions (SSDs). Our questions
   are (1) Do SSDs clarify or obscure the setting of ecological effects
   thresholds for risk assessment? and (2) Do SSDs reduce or introduce
   uncertainty into risk assessment? Our conclusions are that if we could
   determine a community sensitivity distribution, this would provide a
   better estimate of an ecologically relevant effects threshold and
   therefore be an improvement for risk assessment. However, the
   distributions generated are typically based on haphazard collections of
   species and endpoints and by adjusting these to reflect more realistic
   trophic structures we show that effects thresholds can be shifted but in
   a direction and to an extent that is not predictable. Despite claims
   that the SSD approach uses all available data to assess effects, we
   demonstrate that in certain frequently used applications only a small
   fraction of the species going into the SSD determine the effects
   threshold. If the SSD approach is to lead to better risk assessments,
   improvements are needed in how the theory is put into practice. This
   requires careful definition of the risk assessment targets and of the

Abstract = {{An understanding of the nature of soils in natural and human influence
   ecosystems is essential if progress is to be made in the determination
   and monitoring of soil quality. This paper briefly discuss the changing
   circumstances which have resulted in the increased awareness of the
   importance of soil as a key component of both natural and human
   influenced environmental systems. These changed circumstances and the
   recognition of the often crucial role that soils play within these
   systems has resulted in a demand for measures of soil quality, similar
   to those used in the characterisation of water and air. Whilst it is
   relatively straightforward to quantify the fitness to breathe of air, or
   the fitness to drink with respect to water, it is considerably more
   difficult to identify similar criteria to be applied to soil. In part
   this arises because of the wide range of uses to which soils are put and
   in part because of the complexity of the soil system and the possibility
   that changes in the soil may be slow and possibly only occur when some
   threshold is reached. The paper stresses that any index of soil quality
   must consider soil function, and these functions are varied and often
   complex. A soil which is considered to be of high quality for one
   function may not be so for other functions. As a consequence there are
   potentially many soil properties which might serve its indicators of
   soil quality, and research is required to identify the most suitable. It
   may also be questioned whether it is appropriate to pursue this notion
   of a limited number of soil quality indicators. If an indicator is
   chosen comparisons between sites and results from different
   investigators are not possible unless the methods of analysis are given.
   Standard methods of soil analysis must be developed. These standard
   methods are distinct from national standard values, or indicator values
   frequently set by national governments or regulatory agencies. The
   International Standardisation Organisation (ISO) has developed a
   programme for the development of standard methods of soil analysis
   across a range of possible properties including visible, biological,
   physical and chemical properties. If it is decided that soil quality
   indicators are required and progress is to be made on developing
   acceptable indicators of soil quality with agreed standard methods of
   determination there is need for co-operation amongst soil scientists and
   those involved in determining appropriate and sustainable use of the

Abstract = {{This paper tests the use of a spatial analysis technique, based on the
   calculation of local spatial autocorrelation, as a possible approach for
   modelling and quantifying structure in northern Australian savanna
   landscapes. Unlike many landscapes in the world, northern Australian
   savanna landscapes appear on the surface to be intact. They have not
   experienced the same large-scale land clearance and intensive land
   management as other landscapes across Australia. Despite this, natural
   resource managers are beginning to notice that processes are breaking
   down and declines in species are becoming more evident. With future
   declines of species looking more imminent it is particularly important
   that models are available that can help to assess landscape health, and
   quantify any structural change that takes place. GIS and landscape
   ecology provide a useful way of describing landscapes both spatially and
   temporally and have proved to be particularly useful for understanding
   vegetation structure or pattern in landscapes across the world. There
   are many measures that examine spatial structure in the landscape and
   most of these are now available in a GIS environment (e.g. FRAGSTATS{*}
   ARC, r.le, and Patch Analyst). All these methods depend on a landscape
   described in terms of patches, corridors and matrix. However, since
   landscapes in northern Australia appear to be relatively intact they
   tend to exist as surfaces of continuous variation rather than in clearly
   defined homogeneous units. As a result they cannot be easily described
   using entity-based models requiring patches and other essentially
   cartographic approaches. This means that more appropriate methods need
   to be developed and explored. The approach examined in this paper
   enables clustering and local pattern in the data to be identified and
   forms a generic method for conceptualising the landscape structure where
   patches are not obvious and where boundaries between landscape features
   are difficult to determine. Two sites are examined using this approach.
   They have been exposed to different degrees of disturbance by fire and
   grazing. The results show that savanna landscapes are very complex and
   that even where there is a high degree of disturbance the landscape is
   still relatively heterogeneous. This means that treating savanna
   landscapes as being made up of homogeneous units can limit analysis of
   pattern, as it can over simplify the structure present, and that methods
   such as the autocorrelation approach are useful tools for quantifying
   the variable nature of these landscapes. (C) 2002 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to confidently identify or exclude a population as the

   ecology. Several alternative assignment methods have recently been
   developed and are yet to be fully evaluated with empirical data. In this
   study we tested the efficacy of different assignment methods by using a
   translocated rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis) population, of known
   provenance. Specimens from the translocated population (n = 43), its
   known source population (n = 30) and four other nearby populations (n =
   19-32) were genotyped for 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci. The
   results identified Bayesian clustering, frequency and Bayesian methods
   as the most consistent and accurate, correctly assigning 93-100\% of
   individuals up to a significance threshold of P = 0.01. Performance was
   variable among the distance-based methods, with the Cavalli-Sforza and
   Edwards chord distance performing best, whereas Goldstein et al.'s
   (delta mu)(2) consistently performed poorly. Using Bayesian clustering,
   frequency and Bayesian methods we then attempted to determine the source
   of rock-wallabies which have recently recolonized an outcrop (Gardners)
   8 km from the nearest rock-wallaby population. Results indicate that the
   population at Gardners originated via a recent dispersal event from the
   eastern end of Mt. Caroline. This is only the second published record of
   dispersal by rock-wallabies between habitat patches and is the longest
   movement recorded to date. Molecular techniques and methods of analysis
   are now available to allow detailed studies of dispersal in

Abstract = {{In an arid environment. the effect of evaporation on energy balance can
   affect air temperature recordings and greatly impact on degree-day
   calculations. This is an important consideration when choosing a site or
   climate data for phenological models. To our knowledge edge, there is no
   literature showing the effect of the underlying surface and its fetch
   around a weather station on degree-day accumulations. In this paper, we
   present data to show that this is a serious consideration. and it can
   lead to dubious models. Microscale measurements of temperature and
   energy balance are presented to explain why the differences occur. For
   example, the effect of fetch of irrigated grass and wetting of bare soil
   around a weather station on diurnal temperature are reported. A 43-day
   experiment showed that temperature measured on the upwind edge of an
   irrigated grass area averaged 4\% higher than temperatures recorded 200
   in inside the grass field. When the single-triangle method was used with
   a 10 degreesC threshold and starting on May 19. the station on the
   upwind edge recorded 900 degree-days on June 28. whereas the interior
   station recorded 900 degree-days on July 1. Clearly, a difference in
   fetch can lead to big errors for large degree-day accumulations.
   Immediately after wetting, the temperature over a wet soil surface was
   similar to that measured over grass. However. the temperature over the
   soil increased more than that over the grass as the soil surface dried.
   There-fore. the observed difference between temperatures measured over
   bare soil and those over grass increases with longer periods between
   wettings. In most and locations, measuring temperature over irrigated
   grass gives a lower mean annual temperature, resulting in lower annual
   cumulative degree-day values. This was verified by comparing
   measurements over grass with those over bare soil at several weather
   stations in a range of climates, To eliminate the effect of rainfall
   frequency, using temperature data collected only over irrigated grass,
   is recommended for long-term assessment of climate change effects on
   degree-day accumulation. In high evaporative conditions, a fetch of at
   least 100 m of grass is recommended. Our results clearly indicate that
   weather stations sited over bare soil have consistently higher
   degree-day accumulations. Therefore, especially in and environments,
   phenology models based on temperature collected over bare soil are not
   transferable to those based on temperature recorded over irrigated
   grass. At a minimum. all degree-day-based phenology models reported in
   the literature should clearly describe the weather station site.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on three continents have reported associations between various
   measures of airborne particles and daily deaths. Sulfur dioxide has also
   been associated with daily deaths, particularly in Europe. Questions
   remain about the shape of those associations, particularly whether there
   are thresholds at low levels. We examined the association of daily
   concentrations of black smoke and SO2 with daily deaths in eight Spanish
   cities (Barcelona, Bilbao, Castellon, Gijon, Oviedo, Valencia, Vitoria,
   and Zaragoza) with different climates and different environmental and
   social characteristics. We used nonparametric smoothing to estimate the
   shape of the concentration-response curve in each city and combined
   those results using a metasmoothing technique developed by Schwartz and
   Zanobetti. We extended their method to incorporate random variance
   components. Black smoke had a nearly linear association with daily
   deaths, with no evidence of a threshold. A 10 mug/m(3) increase in black
   smoke was associated with a 0.88\% increase in daily deaths (95\%
   confidence interval, 0.56\%-1.20\%). SO2 had a less plausible
   association: Daily deaths increased at very low concentrations, but
   leveled off and then decreased at higher concentrations. These findings
   held in both one- and two-pollutant models and held whether we optimized
   our weather and seasonal model in each city or used the same smoothing
   parameters in each city. We conclude that the association with particle
   levels is more convincing than for SO2, and without a threshold. Linear
   models provide an adequate estimation of the effect of particulate air
   pollution on mortality at low to moderate concentrations.}},

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{1. Models for predicting the distribution of organisms from
   environmental data are widespread in ecology and conservation biology.
   Their performance is invariably evaluated from the percentage success at
   predicting occurrence at test locations.
   2. Using logistic regression with real data from 34 families of aquatic
   invertebrates in 180 Himalayan streams, we illustrate how this
   widespread measure of predictive accuracy is affected systematically by
   the prevalence (i.e. the frequency of occurrence) of the target
   organism. Many evaluations of presence-absence models by ecologists are
   inherently misleading.
   3. With the same invertebrate models, we examined alternative
   performance measures used in remote sensing and medical diagnostics. We
   particularly explored receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plots,
   from which were derived (i) the area under each curve (AUC), considered
   an effective indicator of model performance independent of the threshold
   probability at which the presence of the target organism is accepted,
   and (ii) optimized probability thresholds that maximize the percentage
   of true absences and presences that are correctly identified. We also
   evaluated Cohen's kappa, a measure of the proportion of all possible
   cases of presence or absence that are predicted correctly after
   accounting for chance effects.
   4. AUC measures from ROC plots were independent of prevalence, but
   highly significantly correlated with the much more easily computed
   kappa. Moreover, when applied in predictive mode to test data, models
   with thresholds optimized by ROC erroneously overestimated true
   occurrence among scarcer organisms, often those of greatest conservation
   interest. We advocate caution in using ROC methods to optimize
   thresholds required for real prediction.
   5. Our strongest recommendation is that ecologists reduce their reliance
   on prediction success as a performance measure in presence-absence
   modelling. Cohen's kappa provides a simple, effective, standardized and
   appropriate statistic for evaluating or comparing presence-absence
   models, even those based on different statistical algorithms. None of
   the performance measures we examined tests the statistical significance
   of predictive accuracy, and we identify this as a priority area for
   research and development.}},

Title = {{Size and shape of the geographical ranges of Andean passerine birds:
   spatial patterns in environmental resistance and anisotropy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1281-1294}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aim The geographical distribution of 839 Andean passerine species was
   analysed using two biogeographical indices: environmental resistance
   (R-50) and anisotropy (A(50)). R-50 quantifies the loss of biotic
   resemblance occurring from any point in the map to the rest of the
   continent. A(50) quantifies the extent to which the perimeter : area
   ratio of the geographical ranges of all species whose distributions
   overlap at any particular location depart from the perimeter : area
   ratio of a circle. Three predictions derived from the climatic-tolerance
   hypothesis were tested: (1) the latitudinal Rapoport effect predicts an
   increase in the range-sizes of species, and hence a decrease in the
   values of R-50, towards the south; (2) Janzen's argument that `mountain
   passes are higher in the tropics' predicts greater anisotropy in the
   tropics; (3) because environmental conditions are relatively constant
   across the tropics, and begin to change at the boundaries, this predicts
   high spatial turnover - and hence rapid change of R-50 values - at the
   limits of the tropics.
   Location The Andes, in South America.
   Methods The geographical ranges of 839 passerine species were drawn on a
   standardized grid map of the Andean region. The presence-absence (1-0)
   of each species in each of the 150 cells in the grid map was recorded.
   These data were used to create equiprobabilistic maps, which then were
   used to estimate a value of R-50 and A(50) for each cell in the grid map
   (sensu Rapoport, 1975, 1979, 1982).
   Results The spatial patterns in R-50 and A(50) offer partial support to
   the original predictions. The tendency for R-50 data to decrease with
   latitude (Rapoport effect) vanishes after controlling for differences in
   species richness among latitudes compared. In contrast, A(50) data
   clearly offer indirect support to Janzen's prediction of narrower
   climatic tolerances of species around the tropics, even after
   controlling for differences in species richness. The Andean passerine
   species confirm that spatial turnover of species exists at the southern
   edge of the tropics, and also at different latitudes within the tropics,
   Main conclusions The analysis suggests that it is the major structural
   change in the topography of mountains - and not merely latitude - that
   ultimately governs the spatial variation in size and shape of species
   ranges along the Andes.}},

   monitoring}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-85}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The study was designed to determine seasonal differences in personal
   exposures to respirable suspended particles (RSP) and environmental
   tobacco smoke (ETS) for nonsmokers in Bremen, Germany. The subjects were
   office workers, either living and working in smoking locations or living
   and working in nonsmoking locations. One hundred and twenty four
   randomly selected nonsmoking subjects collected air samples close to
   their breathing zone by wearing personal monitors for 24 h or, in some
   cases, for 7-day periods during the winter of 1999. The investigation
   was repeated in the summer with 126 subjects, comprised of as many of
   the studied winter population (89 subjects) as possible. Saliva cotinine
   analyses were undertaken to verify the nonsmoking status of the
   subjects. Subjects wore one personal monitor while at work and one while
   away from the workplace on weekdays, and a third monitor at the weekend.
   Collected air samples were analysed for RSP, nicotine, 3-ethenylpyridine
   (3-EP) and ETS particles. The latter were estimated using ultraviolet
   absorbance (UVPM), fluorescence (FPM) and solanesol (SolPM)
   measurements. ETS exposure was consistently higher in the winter than in
   the summer, this pattern being particularly evident for subjects both
   living and working with smokers. The highest median 24-h time weighted
   average (TWA) concentrations of ETS particles (SolPM, 25 mug m(-3)) and
   nicotine (1.3 mug m-3) were recorded for subjects performing weekday
   monitoring during the winter. These were significantly higher than
   equivalent levels of ETS particles (SolPM, 2.4 mug m(-3)) and nicotine
   (0.26 mug m(-3)) determined during the summer. There were no appreciable
   differences between winter and summer percent workplace contributions to
   median TWA ETS particle and nicotine weekday concentrations, the
   workplace in Bremen, in general, contributing between 35\% and 61\% of
   reported median concentrations. Workers, on average, spent one-third of
   their time at work during a weekday, indicating that concentrations were
   either comparable or higher in the workplace than in the home and other
   locations outside the workplace. Median 24-h weekend ETS particle and
   nicotine concentrations for smoking locations were not significantly
   different from equivalent weekday levels during the winter, but were
   significantly lower during the summer. Based upon median 24-h TWA SolPM
   and nicotine concentrations for the winter, extrapolated to 1 year's ETS
   exposure, those subjects both living and working in smoking locations
   (the most highly exposed group) would potentially inhale 13 cigarette
   equivalents/year (CEs/y). However, based on a similar extrapolation of
   summer measurements, the same group of subjects would potentially inhale
   between 1.3 and 1.9 CEs/y. The most highly exposed subjects in this
   study, based upon 90th percentile concentrations for those both living
   and working in smoking locations during the winter, would potentially
   inhale up to 67 CEs/y in the winter and up to 22 CEs/y in the summer.
   This clearly demonstrates that seasonal effects should be taken into
   account in the design and interpretation of ETS exposure studies. Air
   sampling over a 7-day period was shown to be technically feasible, and
   subsequent RSP, ETS particle and nicotine levels determined by 7-day
   monitoring were not found to be significantly different from equivalent
   levels determined by 24-h monitoring.
   However, the longer sampling period resulted in the collection of an
   increased quantity of analytes, which improved the limits of
   quantitation (LOQ) and allowed a more accurate determination of low
   level ETS exposure. This was reflected by a reduced percentage of data
   falling below the LOQ for 7-day monitoring compared with 24-h
   monitoring. The use of a liquid chromatographic method with tandem mass
   spectrometric detection for saliva cotinine measurement afforded a
   greatly improved LOQ and greater accuracy at low concentrations compared
   with the radioimmunoassay (RIA) method used in previous studies by these
   authors. In this study, 17 subjects out of 180 tested (9.4\%) were found
   to have saliva cotinine levels exceeding the selected threshold of 25 ng
   ml(-1) used to discriminate between smokers and nonsmokers. (C) 2001

   An over-development of commercial fisheries has brought about a

Volume = {{84}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The objective of concepts to assess and implement sustainability in
   agriculture is to consolidate the complex and diverse principles of the
   theoretical paradigm and to transform them into recommendations for
   agricultural practice. Since only goal-oriented concepts show a high
   adaptation to different conditions and target groups, their fundamental
   strategy was highlighted and their suitability for successful
   operationalisation was worked out. Seven goal-oriented concepts,
   representing the main current methods of sustainability assessment, were
   evaluated regarding potential and drawbacks for a successful transfer of
   the theoretical paradigm into practice.
   A principal strategy of goal-oriented concepts has been identified in
   all concepts: goal definition, indicator selection, evaluation based on
   indicator sets and final formulation of management advice. In most of
   the seven reviewed concepts, the protection of the agricultural
   production system itself is postulated as a major aim. Consequently,
   indicator sets mainly consist of production-oriented indicators and
   eco-balancing predominantly represents the methodological framework. Six
   of the seven selected concepts base sustainability assessment on an
   evaluation strategy with estimated threshold values or margins of
   tolerance.
   Three main drawbacks of goal-oriented concepts have been identified that
   restrict to transfer the theoretical sustainability paradigm into
   agricultural practice: (1) the lack of systemic and transferable
   indicators which characterise agricultural and other eco-systems
   regarding all dimensions of sustainability; (2) the deficit of an
   adequate evaluation of agro-ecosystems; and (3) the lack of principal
   guidelines for the formulation of management advice for practical
   application. Goal-oriented concepts based on models fur agronomy and
   management show a high potential to overcome these drawbacks and
   therefore represent a promising tool to bridge the gap between theory
   and practice of sustainability in agriculture. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Designers and managers of recycling processing plants need to be
   informed about the inherent occupational health and safety risks;
   however, there are few studies in the literature describing these risks.
   Therefore, the objectives of this project were to document the
   biological, chemical, physical, and ergonomic risks in three
   household-waste recycling plants. Bioaerosols (molds and bacteria) were
   measured using the methodology recommended by the American Society for
   Testing and Materials (ASTM). Chemical contaminants and physical agents
   suspected of being present in this type of environment were measured
   using the standard methods of the Quebec Occupational Health and Safety
   Research Institute (IRSST). The ergonomic part of the study identified
   the work requirements and risk factors causing the workers' physical
   symptoms.
   In summer, the average concentrations of total bacteria were greater
   than the Scandinavian guideline of 10,000 colony forming units per cubic
   meter of air (CFU/m(3)) in the receiving areas in plants 1 and 3, in the
   sorting areas of the three plants, and in shipping in plants 1 and 3.
   When the average concentrations of Gram-negative bacteria were compared
   to the Scandinavian guideline of 1000 CFU/m(3) of air, only the sorting
   department in plant 2 in summer exceeded this value. Average indoor
   concentrations of molds that were statistically significantly greater
   than those measured in the upwind outdoor air were measured in all
   departments in plants 1 and 3, regardless of the season, and only in
   sorting in plant 2 during the summer. The only chemical contaminant
   measured at average concentrations greater than 50\% of the Threshold
   Limit Values (TLVs) proposed by the American Conference of Governmental
   Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) was CO in the sorting departments in
   plants 1 and 2 during the winter. Noise exceeded the ACGIH TLV in plant
   2. The workers' physical symptoms seem to be caused by the posture and
   effort required while remaining in a stationary position. Action must be
   focused on improving aspects such as work organization and personal
   protection and on informing citizens of the need for cleanliness of the
   material to be recycled.}},

Abstract = {{The region of Diwalwal, dominated by Mt. Diwata, is a gold rush area on
   Mindanao (Philippines) where approximately 15 000 people live. The
   fertile plain of Monkayo is situated downstream, where people grow crops
   such as rice and bananas; locally caught fish is eaten frequently. The
   ore is dug in small-scale mines and ground to a powder by ball-mills
   while still in Diwalwal. The gold is then extracted by adding liquid
   mercury (Hg), forming gold-amalgam. To separate the gold from the Hg, in
   most cases the amalgam is simply heated in the open by blow-torches. A
   high external Hg burden of the local population must be assumed. To
   evaluate the internal Hg burden of the population and the extent of
   possible negative health effects, 323 volunteers from Mt. Diwalwal,
   Monkayo and a control group from Davao were examined by a questionnaire,
   neurological examination and neuro-psychological testing. Blood, urine
   and hair samples were taken from each participant and analyzed for total
   Hg. A statistical evaluation was possible for 102 workers
   (occupationally Hg burdened ball-millers and amalgamsmelters), 63 other
   inhabitants from Mt. Diwata ('only' exposed from the environment), 100
   persons, living downstream in Monkayo, and 42 inhabitants of Davao
   (serving as controls). The large volume of data was reduced to yes/no
   decisions. Alcohol as a possible bias factor was excluded (level of
   alcohol consumption and type, see Section 4.4). Each factor with a
   statistically significant difference of at least one exposed group to
   the control group was included in a medical score (0-21 points). In each
   of the exposed groups this score was significantly worse than in the
   control group (median control, 3; downstream, 9; Mt. Diwata,
   non-occupational exposed, 6; Hg workers, 10). In comparison to the
   surprisingly high Hg concentration in blood (median, 9.0 mug/l; max,
   31.3) and in hair (2.65 mug/g; max, 34.7) of the control group, only the
   workers show elevated levels: Hg-blood median 11.4, max 107.6; Hg-hair
   median 3.62, max 37.8. The Hg urine concentrations of the occupational
   exposed and non-exposed population on Mt.Diwata was significantly higher
   than in the control group: control median 1.7 mug/l, max 7.6;
   non-occupational burdened median 4.1, max 76.4; and workers median 11.0,
   max 294.2. The participants, living downstream on the plain of Monkayo
   show no statistically significant difference in Hg-blood, Hg-urine or
   Hg-hair in comparison with the control group. The German
   Human-Biological-Monitoring value II (HBM II) was exceeded in 19.5\%
   (control), 26.0\% (downstream), 19.4\% (Mt. Diwata, non-occupational)
   and 55.4\% (workers) of the cases, the German occupational threshold
   limit in 19.6\% of the workers. Only some of the clinical data,
   characteristic for Hg intoxication (e.g. tremor, loss of memory, bluish
   discoloration of the gingiva, etc.), correlate with Hg in blood or
   urine, but not with Hg in hair. The medical score sum correlates only
   with Hg in urine. The poor correlation between the Hg concentration in
   the biomonitors to classic clinical signs of chronic Hg intoxication may
   be explained by several factors: HE in blood, urine and hair do not
   adequately monitor the Hg burden of the target tissues, especially the
   brain. Inter-individual differences in the sensitiveness to Hg are
   extremely large.
   In this area a mixed burden of Hg species must be assumed (Hg vapor,
   inorganic Kg, methyl-Kg). Chronic Hg burden may have established damage
   months or even years before the actual determination of the Hg
   concentrations in the bio-monitors under quite different burden was
   performed (Drasch G. Mercury. In: Seller HG, Sigel A, Sigel H, editors.
   Handbook on metals in clinical and analytical chemistry. New York:
   Marcel Dekker, 1994:479-494). Therefore, `Hg intoxication', that should
   be treated, was not diagnosed by the Hg concentration in the
   bio-monitors alone, but by a balanced combination of these Hg values and
   the medical score sum. In principle, this means the higher the Hg
   concentration in the bio-monitors, the lower the number of
   characteristic adverse effects are required for a positive diagnosis. By
   this method, 0\% of the controls, 35\% downstream, 27\% from Mt. Diwata,
   non-occupational exposed and 71.6\% of the workers were classified as Hg
   intoxicated. A reduction of the external Hg burden on Mt. Diwata is
   urgently recommended. An attempt to treat the intoxicated participants
   with the chelating agent dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS) is
   planned. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The persistence of water quality problems has directed attention toward
   reduction of agricultural non-point sources of phosphorus (P). We
   assessed the practical impact of three management scenarios of the
   USDA-EPA Strategy for Animal Feeding Operations to reduce P losses from

   An environmental threshold of 190 mg Mehlich-3 P kg(-1) soil, above

   crop removal on 32\% of the watershed. Finally, a site assessment P
   index, which accounts for likely source and transport risks was used.
   This showed none of the watershed was at high risk of P loss and that
   areas of medium risk (where remedial treasures should be considered)

   the best method to target remedial management to minimize P export and

Abstract = {{Over the last 20 years or so, there has been steadily increasing
   activity in the area of applied human odour measurement. This has been
   especially true outside of the United States. Yet, for about 40 years,
   there has also been decreasing interest and activity, on the part of
   academic smell researchers; in rigorous quantitative measurement of the
   functional properties of the human olfactory system. There are some
   optimistic signs, however, that this situation may be improving. Applied
   meetings such as this one are reaching out to learn more about basic
   research in human olfaction and some research groups are venturing out
   to indoor air quality, environmental health, water quality and other
   applied areas. In this paper I hope to support and accelerate the
   increasingly fruitful interactions that are beginning. The paper aims to
   make four main points. First, some of the most important ways in which
   the laboratory differs from everyday life will be noted. Keeping these
   differences in mind lessens the risk that laboratory data will be used
   uncritically to make predictions of real-world responses to chemical
   stimuli. Next, the specific benefits that would accrue from more
   fruitful interactions between basic and applied researchers will be
   highlighted; this is perhaps best seen by noting problem areas resulting
   from too little cross-fertilisation. Third, the CEN standard for the
   measurement of odour thresholds will be discussed in light of what is
   known concerning both the functional aspects of the human olfactory
   system and the current state of knowledge concerning best methods for
   investigating this system. Finally, some recent work we have done that
   was designed to help characterise human odour responses and demonstrate
   improved methodology, will be briefly mentioned. The paper concludes
   with suggestions as to how the scientific basis of applied odour
   measurement may best be enhanced.}},

   nutrient flux. The results pointed out that threshold level for optimum
   population density in Spartina grandiflora salt marsh is 0.1 mg/L of
   nitrates. A dense crab population, adjacent to the golf course with a
   buffer zone, was indicative of restoration of the estuarine ecosystem. A

Abstract = {{Aim It has been suggested that populations nearing the border of a
   species' range should be maladapted because they occupy progressively
   less suitable environments. In some instances, however, peripheral
   populations might acclimate or even be adapted to local conditions. We
   studied Iberian robins to evaluate whether southern, peripheral
   populations become more restrictive in selecting their habitats, are
   locally differentiated or show evidence of maladaptation.
   Location We divided the Iberian Peninsula into three regions (the
   Eurosiberian and Supra-Mediterranean regions in northern Iberia, and the
   Mediterranean Lowlands in southern Iberia), which define a gradient of
   increasing dryness southwards. In each region, we selected one
   representative locality, where we captured individuals during three
   study years.
   Methods We reviewed 72 community studies to test whether Iberian robins
   occupy fewer forests and decrease in abundance southwards. Because
   robins are sedentary in the southernmost region, but largely abandon
   both northern areas in winter, we analysed the variation in
   migration-related morphology to test for population differentiation in
   the range boundary. To examine how populations cope with environmental
   variation, we studied four indices of juvenile condition (fluctuating
   asymmetry, fledgling size, ptilochronology and size-corrected body
   mass), each related to nutritional, conditions in a particular stage of
   growth, from early development to independence.
   Results Although robins restricted their range southwards, there was no
   change in local abundance between regions. Southernmost robins,
   consistent with their sedentary behaviour, had shorter and more rounded
   wings than northern robins, although the populations did not differ in
   terms of body size. Fluctuating asymmetry and fledgling size did not
   evidence a higher developmental stress in peripheral populations,
   although southernmost robins had a lower juvenile condition during their
   independence (as shown by ptilochronology and residual body mass).
   Main conclusions The distribution of abundance found in this study
   supports the idea that Iberian robins could select habitats above a
   somehow restrictive threshold of quality. In addition, morphological
   correlates of migratory behaviour provided evidence of population
   differentiation at the range edge. This introduces the possibility that
   among-region variations in juvenile condition actually reflect
   reproductive benefits for migrants, related to the occupation of
   seasonally productive habitats, rather than the maladaptation of
   sedentary, peripheral populations. From this perspective, and in view of
   the patterns of distribution and morphology that we found, southern
   Iberian robins might be independent populations locally adapted in the
   range boundary.}},

Abstract = {{Apparent leaf photosynthesis of the grass Stipa bromoides was measured
   in the field in two sites of Northern Greece. For predicting apparent
   photosynthesis from irradiance, temperature and relative air humidity
   data, we applied and compared two modelling approaches: ordinary
   statistical modelling and automatic model construction based on machine
   learning procedures. Ordinary statistical models were constructed based
   on background knowledge concerning the response of photosynthesis to
   irradiance. A Michaelis-Menten type light saturation curve was selected
   among six candidate models and was extended to include air temperature
   effects. A bell-shaped function of temperature was substituted for the
   parameter describing the asymptotic maximum photosynthesis. The final
   model accounted for 67.3\% of data variation and was further improved by
   splitting the data set by experimental site. Site-specific differences
   were detected regarding the half saturation constant for light and the
   optimal temperature for photosynthesis. Automatic model construction
   produced a number of regression trees that enabled a detailed but simple
   description of the way irradiance, temperature and relative humidity
   affect photosynthesis. Photosynthesis increases with increasing
   irradiance, temperature affects photosynthesis when irradiance is close
   to saturation levels and relative humidity has an effect when both
   irradiance and temperature are high. There is a threshold value of
   relative humidity (at about 35\%), below which photosynthesis is
   independent of irradiance within the observed range, decreasing with
   increasing temperature when temperature is high (> 25 degrees C) and
   increasing with increasing relative humidity when temperature is low (<
   25 degrees C). The machine learning tools we used provide a very
   powerful modelling alternative to ordinary curve fitting methods. Their
   major advantages are the flexibility to select between accuracy and
   generality and their robustness against outliers and mixtures of
   differential responses. The models are transparent and easily
   interpreted. They seem to be able to handle quite complex dependencies
   among attributes, not requiring prior expert knowledge. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The discharge of industrial wastes is subject to strict regulations and
   controls. In many cases where a verification of the relative safety
   level is required, biological assays carried out on microorganisms,
   invertebrates have been proposed as means of assessing the global
   harmlessness of wastes towards living beings. However, the universal
   validity of some of these tests is questionable and it is generally
   accepted that more tests are needed in order to ensure a higher standard
   of safety with respect to higher vertebrates and humans.
   Another problem arises when certain low-toxicity wastes are generated in
   vast quantities, such as decanted sludge from sewage pipes. fortunately,
   it is possible in many cases to scatter these wastes on cultivable soils
   as fertilizer after being verified harmless. For that purpose, we have
   developed a test which utilizes human cells (HT29 cell-line from human
   gut mucosa) in culture.
   The measured growth rate of these cells after a 24 hr-exposure to
   filtration-sterilized sludge samples is taken as an index of any
   cellular insult. The fact that tests are carried out on naked cells in
   culture flasks (96 wells plates) is likely to permit the detection of
   any noxious effect with the highest sensitivity. In order to improve
   rapidity and sensitivity of the test, growth rate was estimated by
   incorporating a colorimetric assay for total proteins (using
   sulforhodamine B) directly into the culture plates. The test was then
   applied to actual decanted sludge from water-treatment plants.
   It appears that sludge stimulates cell growth before having a negative
   effect for higher concentration, indicating that sludges are not highly
   toxic products.
   Our biological test integrates all chemical agents as well as all
   possible synergistic effects which could impair cell growth, our values
   represent the maximal potential harmful effect on the environment. From
   the threshold of concentration which does not affect cell growth, we
   have calculated a numeric ``safety index{''} expressed as t/ha/yr which
   indicates the amount of sludge which can be dispersed, as a fertilizer,
   per hectare of agricultural soils.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfonylurea (SU), imidazolinone (IMI), and sulfonamide (SA) herbicides
   are new classes of low-application-rate herbicides increasingly used by
   farmers. Some of these herbicides affect both weed and crop species at
   low dosages and must be carefully used. Less is known about the effect
   of these compounds on non-crop plant species, bur a concentration of 100
   ng/l in water has been proposed as the threshold for possible plant
   toxicity for most of these herbicides. Hence, analytical methods must be
   capable of detecting SUs, IMIs, and SAs at concentrations less than 100
   ng/l in ambient water samples. The authors developed a two-cartridge,
   solid-phase extraction method for isolating 12 SU, 3 IMI, and 1 SA
   herbicides by using high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray
   ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS) to identify and quantify
   these herbicides to 10 ng/l. This method was used to analyze 196
   surface- and ground-water samples collected from May to August 1998
   throughout the Midwestern United States, and more than 100
   quality-assurance and quality-control samples. During the 16 weeks of
   the study, the HPLC/ESI-MS maintained excellent calibration linearity
   across the calibration range from 5 to 500 ng/l, with correlation
   coefficients of 0.9975 or greater. Continuing calibration verification
   standards at 100-ng/l concentration were analyzed throughout the study,
   and the average measured concentrations for individual herbicides ranged
   from 93 to 100 ng/l. Recovery of herbicides from 27 reagent-water
   samples spiked at 50 and 100 ng/l ranged from 39 to 92\%, and averaged
   73\%. The standard deviation of recoveries ranged from 14 to 26\%, and
   averaged 20\%. This variability reflects multiple instruments,
   operators, and the use of automated and manual sample preparation.
   Spiked environmental water samples had similar recoveries, although for
   some herbicides, the sample matrix enhanced recoveries by as much as
   200\% greater than the spiked concentration. This matrix enhancement was
   sample- and compound-dependent. Concentrations of herbicides in unspiked
   duplicate environmental samples were typically within 25\% of each
   other. The results demonstrate the usefulness of HPLC/ESI-MS for
   determining low-application-rate herbicides at ambient concentrations.

   Vapors are first trapped on a miniature adsorbent preconcentrator housed
   within the instrument and then thermally desorbed for analysis by the
   microsensor array. Each measurement cycle requires 5.5 min. The
   collective responses from the array are stored and then analyzed using
   pattern recognition methods to yield the identities and concentrations
   of collected vapors and vapor mixture components. Following initial
   optimization of instrument operating parameters, calibrations were
   performed with 16 organic solvent vapors and selected mixtures to
   establish a response library for each of two identical instruments.
   Limits of detection less than or equal to 0.1 x threshold limit value
   were obtained for most vapors. In a series of 90 subsequent exposure
   tests, vapors were recognized with an error of <6\% (individual vapor
   challenges) and <16\% (binary mixture challenges) and quantified with an
   average error of <10\%. Monte Carte simulations were coupled with
   pattern recognition analyses to predict the performance for many

   errors ranged from <1 to 24\%. Performance is shown to depend

Abstract = {{Effectiveness of regular sampling grids to collect multivariate

   and boundary effects. In addition, earlier observations and knowledge on
   the history of the area may provide valuable information. This paper
   extends a simulated annealing-based procedure to optimize the sampling
   scheme, taking sampling constraints and preliminary information into
   account. A new optimization criterion is formulated that is able to
   handle multivariate problems. The sampling scheme is optimized using a
   spatial weight function that allows to distinguish between areas with
   different priorities. A case study in Rotterdam harbour with five
   contaminants at two depths showed two sequential sampling stages, in
   which two weight functions were applied. The first stage combined
   earlier observations and historical knowledge, with emphasis on areas
   with high priority. The resulting scheme showed a contamination at
   17.4\% of the samples, with 1.5\% heavily contaminated. The second stage
   used probability maps of exceeding intermediate threshold values to
   guide additional sampling to possible hotspots. This yielded 26.7\%
   contaminated samples, with 16.7\% being heavily contaminated. This
   included new locations that were not detected during the first stage.

Abstract = {{Pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) has been proposed as an
   indicator of the deleterious effects of pollutants on communities in the
   field. Nematode assemblages were sampled at 10 estuarine sites that
   ranged from uncontaminated to grossly contaminated with metals. Relative
   tolerance of these assemblages to Cu was quantified using acute toxicity
   tests. There were targe differences between sites in tolerance to Cu,
   and copper tolerance was strongly correlated with severity of
   contamination. Enhanced Cu tolerance occurred at two sites where Cu
   concentration in sediment was around 180 mu g/g but not at a third site,
   where Cu concentration was 214 mu g/g. This implies a threshold of
   effects on these nematode communities at similar to 200 mu g/g Cu.
   Comparison with studies of nematode community composition in these same
   estuaries indicates that PICT is at least as sensitive as the best
   available ecological monitoring methods. It is, however, faster to carry
   out and requires much less taxonomic expertise. The PICT appears to he a
   sensitive indicator of ecological effects of pollution and has
   considerable promise as a monitoring tool.}},

Journal = {{HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Environmental investigations of former industrial sites often detect the
   presence of chemicals for which no soil criteria exist and for which
   regulatory agencies have not derived estimates of toxic potency. This
   poses a considerable problem for making informed risk management
   decisions involving sites where such chemicals are present. As a result,
   a methodology has been developed for making risk-based decisions for
   chemicals of unknown toxic potency in soil at contaminated sites. The
   method is based on principles and procedures used by the US Food and
   Drug Administration (USFDA), the US Environmental Protection Agency
   (USEPA) and the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME).
   After analyzing the data on hundreds of carcinogenic and
   non-carcinogenic substances, the USFDA and other leading researchers
   have concluded that, if no toxicological data is available on a
   chemical, exposures less than 1.5 mu g/person/day (i.e., 0.02 mu g/kg
   body weight/day) are unlikely to result in appreciable health risks even
   if the substance was later found to be a carcinogen. To develop maximum
   soil concentrations that will be protective of human health (i.e., Risk
   Management Criteria or RMC), the above exposure limit of 0.02 mu g/kg
   body weight/day has been assumed to be protective of risks from exposure
   to chemicals lacking toxicological data. Using a stochastic risk
   assessment model for estimating exposures to chemicals from contaminated
   sites, our analyses indicate that a soil concentration of 2 mu g/g would
   be protective of human health for land uses that include residential,
   commercial, and industrial development provided no major indirect
   pathways exist at the site. If indirect pathways exists (e.g., vapor
   infiltration of soil gases, uptake of chemicals into garden produce,
   etc.), alternate RMC could be developed, that include such indirect
   pathways, using the methodology provided in this paper Used by
   experienced risk assessors, the approach is a scientifically defensible
   screening method that will preclude many chemicals from unnecessary
   evaluation, while allowing risk assessors to focus efforts on chemicals
   of greater concern and make informed risk management decisions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an alternative method to predict the
   Gonadosomatic Index (GSI), based on a technique known as computational
   neural networks (CNNs), with two main objectives: (1) to develop a quick
   and reliable method for the prediction of the fish reproductive period
   under variable environmental conditions, and thus (2) to reduce the
   field sampling and laboratory efforts. Three different neural
   architectures (5-6-6-1, 5-8-8-1 and 5-10-10-1), whose `training' was
   carried out controlling three threshold determinism coefficients
   (R-t(2): 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9), were trained to estimate the GSI of an
   introduced pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) population inhabiting a highly
   fluctuating Mediterranean stream in southern Spain. This GSI estimate
   was made using several easily measured fish and environmental variables.
   The correlation (R) between the GSI observed (GSI(r)) and the GSI
   predicted by the CNN (GSI(e)) was very high (> 0.8 in all cases). The
   optimal CNN structure was the 5-6-6-1 with R-t(2) = 0.8 because it
   produced the best generalization of the confidence limits of GSI(e) with
   respect to GSI(r). To compare with traditional multiple regression
   analysis, we submitted the data to the same process as with CNN. The
   validation of the regression model produced a much lower correlation (R)
   than the CNN models. As an example of the predictive capacities of the
   CNN models, we predict the hypothetical pumpkinseed reproductive cycle
   of our population but under the environmental conditions found in the
   Camargue marshes (South France).}},

Pages = {{S55-S73}},
Abstract = {{It is a vexing problem to achieve a consensus about the proper
   scientific way to assess population viability for habitat conservation
   plans. Rather than a hypothesis-testing approach, here it is proposed to
   select population models, estimate extinction parameters, and assess
   prediction uncertainty using a pragmatic, empirical Bayesian approach.
   The simplest usable models include the effects of population growth, r;
   carrying capacity, K; Allee threshold, N-A; and environmental
   stochasticity, v(r). Analytic predictions of expected extinction times
   are available for such models. Models that are more complex can be
   elaborated from this basis. Selection from a hierarchy of nesting
   population models can often be done through the evaluation of
   parameters. The estimation of the most important extinction parameters
   can be undertaken in a variety of ways. Time series can be analyzed to
   estimate r(d), v(r), rho, and K. Habitat models and individualistic
   population models may help estimate N, and K and demographic
   stochasticity. Fine-scale biogeography and climatological data may be
   useful in the estimation of a variety of parameters. Because it takes
   many years to estimate extinction parameters accurately for a given
   population of interest, the most efficient estimation procedures are
   desirable. I propose the use of prior information from an (as yet
   nonexistent) population biology database. The accumulation of local
   information through monitoring will improve our estimates allowing
   adaptive management. Uncertainty in the estimates will always remain,
   but it may be quantified by the posterior distributions. A crude example
   is discussed using treefrog population data. Although the motivations,
   beliefs, and biases of competing stakeholders will differ, a habitat
   conservation plan could accommodate this variation in the prior
   distributions. Field experience from monitoring will increasingly clear
   up any discrepancies between the opposing beliefs and the real
   ecosystem. As the world is an uncertain place and because there is no
   universal scientific method, there will always be controversy and
   surprises. The best we can do is (1) agree about our prior information,
   (2) agree about the strategy of model selection and parameter
   estimation, and (3) agree about our strategy for adaptive management.
   Perhaps the greatest impediment to such prior agreements for HCPs is the
   likely paranoia inspired by the use of unfamiliar statistical
   methodology. We need to train students of ecology in a more flexible and
   deeper understanding of statistics and philosophy of science.}},

Abstract = {{Spatially resolved hazard assessment (SRHA) and spatially resolved
   exposure assessment (SREA) are methodologies that have been devised for
   assessing child exposure to soil containing environmental pollutants.
   These are based on either a quantitative or a semiquantitative approach.
   The feasibility of the methodologies has been demonstrated in a study
   assessing child exposure to Pb accessible in soil at the town of Lavrion
   in Greece. Using a quantitative approach, both measured and kriged
   concentrations of Pb in soil are compared with an ``established{''}
   statutory threshold value. The probabilistic approach gives a refined
   classification of the contaminated land, since it takes into
   consideration the uncertainty in both the actual measurement and
   estimated kriged values. Two exposure assessment models (i.e., IEUBK and
   HESP) are used as the basis of the quantitative SREA methodologies. The
   significant correlation between the blood-Pb predictions, using the
   IEUBK model, and measured concentrations provides a partial validation
   of the method, because it allows for the uncertainty in the measurements
   and the lack of some site-specific measurements. The semiquantitative
   applications of SRHA and SREA incorporate both qualitative information
   (e.g., land use and dustiness of waste) and quantitative information
   (e.g., distance from wastes and distance from industry). The significant
   correlation between the results of these assessments and the measured
   blood-Pb levels confirms the robust nature of this approach. Successful
   application of these methodologies could reduce the cost of the
   assessment and allow areas to be prioritized for further investigation,
   remediation, or risk management. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Both high sensitivity and good measurement accuracy are required in a
   metals continuous emissions monitor in order for it to be acceptable for
   compliance monitoring. An atmospheric plasma sustained by microwaves
   with an attached source of a calibrated trace metals aerosol has been
   shown to be capable of achieving both of these requirements. The
   microwave plasma is continuous and operates in undiluted stack exhaust
   for atomic emission spectroscopy of trace metals. The plasma is
   sustained in a shorted waveguide that is attached to the stack by a
   short sample line (< 50 cm). It is powered at 1.5 kW, at a frequency of
   2.45 GHz. An undiluted stack slipstream is isokinetically drawn into the
   plasma by a suction pump at a nominal flow of 14 l/min. The pneumatic
   nebulizer attached to the sample line can momentarily, on command,
   inject a known concentration of metals solution providing a real-time
   span calibration. The system was tested on the exhaust stack of the
   rotary kiln incinerator simulator facility at the Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA) National Risk Management Laboratory in Research
   Triangle Park. Three hazardous metals were monitored, lead, chromium,
   and beryllium. These measurements were referenced to EPA Method-29. A
   total of 20 spiked stack exhaust tests were carried out. Ten one-hour
   tests at high concentration (40-60 mu g/actual m(3)) and ten one and
   half-hour tests at low concentration (10-15 mu g/actual m(3)). The
   microwave plasma monitor achieved relative accuracies of approximately
   20\% for lead and beryllium and 40\% for chromium with a threshold
   detection capability of < 3 mu g/actual m3 for a time response of
   similar to 1 min. The relative accuracy deviation from the EPA Method-29
   was found to be mostly systematic. This suggests the possibility of
   using a site-specific calibration to bring the microwave plasma into
   compliance with EPA's goal of 20\% relative accuracy to the reference
   method. Laboratory work is continuing to add mercury, arsenic, and
   cadmium to the monitored metals. Mercury and arsenic present a
   particular challenge to achieving high detection sensitivity in
   undiluted stack exhaust because the plasma is less efficient in exciting
   Hg and because UV absorption interferes with As detection. This is a
   problem that is also in common with air ICP and in situ spark plasma
   methods for continuous emissions monitoring of metals. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Bed state, ripple migration and bedform transport of fine sand (D-50 =

   and steady flows were recorded and correlated with observed bed state
   and ripple migration. A well-defined threshold for the traction of fine
   sand under largely orthogonal combined flows is apparent in our data. It
   is defined by the expression Theta(cb)' = {[}Theta(w)' + Theta(c)'] =
   0.04. The value is 20\% less than the threshold criterion defined by
   GRANT and MADSEN (1979) for wave-dominant flows and extends it to the
   current dominant flow conditions when flows are orthogonal to each
   other. In addition, a threshold for saltation/suspension under combined
   flows is defined by the expression Theta(cb)' = {[}Theta(w)' + 1.5
   Theta(c)] = 0.17. This threshold marks the onset of saltation and grain
   bypassing of ripple lee faces and approximates closely the breakoff
   Shields parameter (Theta(br)' = 0.16) of GRANT and MADSEN (1982).
   Bedform transport measurements are applicable only below this point;
   termed the equilibrium range by GRANT and MADSEN (1982). The sediment
   transport model SEDTRANS matched the duration and magnitude of sand
   transport over a wide range of conditions of combined flow. This was
   achieved by using the method of GRANT and MADSEN (1979), but minimizing

Abstract = {{Quantitative assessment of climatic and environmental health risks is
   necessary because changes in climate are expected. We therefore aimed to
   quantify the relationship between climatic extremes and mortality in the
   5 largest Australian cities during the period 1979-1990. We then applied
   the relationship determined between recent climatic conditions and
   mortality to scenarios for climate and demographic change, to predict
   potential impacts on public health in the cities in the year 2030. Data
   on mortality, denominator population and climate were obtained. The
   expected numbers of deaths per day in each city were calculated.
   Observed daily deaths were compared with expected rates according to
   temperature thresholds. Mortality was also examined in association with
   temporal synoptic indices (TSI) of climate, developed by principal
   component and cluster analysis. According to observed-expected threshold
   analyses, for the 5 cities combined, the annual mean excess of deaths
   attributable to temperature over the period 1979-1990 was 175 for the 28
   degrees threshold. This sum of statistically significant differences
   from the 5 cities was the greatest excess found in association with any
   threshold considered in the range of temperatures that occur. Excess
   mortality for the hottest days in summer was greater than for the
   coldest days in winter. Temperature-mortality relationships were tittle
   modified by socio-economic status. TSI analyses produced similar
   results: using this method, the climate-attributable mortality in the 5
   cities was approximately 160 deaths yr(-1), although this number was
   evenly distributed across summer and winter. Persons in the group aged
   65 yr and older were the most vulnerable. After allowing for increases
   in population, and combining all age groups, the synoptic method showed
   a 10\% reduction in mortality in the year 2030. We conclude that the 5
   largest Australian cities exhibit climate-attributable mortality in both
   summer and winter. Given the scenarios of regional warming during the
   next 3 decades, the expected changes in mortality due to direct climatic
   effects in these major coastal Australian cities are minor.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the occurrence of a common river bird, the Plumbeous
   Redstart Rhyacornis fuliginosus, along 180 independent streams in the
   Indian and Nepali Himalaya. We then compared the performance of multiple
   discrimant analysis (MDA), logistic regression (LR) and artificial
   neural networks (ANN) in predicting this species' presence or absence
   from 32 variables describing stream altitude, slope, habitat structure,
   chemistry and invertebrate abundance. Using the entire data (= training
   set) and a threshold for accepting presence in ANN and LR set to P
   greater than or equal to 0.5, ANN correctly classified marginally more
   cases (88\%) than either LR (83\%) or MDA (84\%). Model performance was
   assessed from two methods of data partitioning. In a `leave-one-out'
   approach, LR correctly predicted more cases (82\%) than MDA (73\%) or
   ANN (69\%). However, in a holdout procedure, all the methods performed
   similarly (73-75\%). All methods predicted true absence (i.e.
   specificity in holdout: 81-85\%) better than true presence (i.e.
   sensitivity: 57-60\%). These effects reflect species' prevalence (=
   frequency of occurrence), but are seldom considered in distribution
   modelling. Despite occurring at only 36\% of the sites, Plumbeous
   Redstarts are one of the most common Himalayan river birds, and problems
   will be greater with less common species. Both LR and ANN require an
   arbitrary threshold probability (often P = 0.5) at which to accept
   species presence from model prediction. Simulations involving varied
   prevalence revealed that LR was particularly sensitive to threshold
   effects. ROC plots (received operating characteristic) were therefore
   used to compare model performance on test data at a range of thresholds;
   LR always outperformed ANN. This case study supports the need to test
   species' distribution models with independent data, and to use a range
   of criteria in assessing model performance. ANN do not yet have major
   advantages over conventional multivariate methods for assessing bird
   distributions. LR and MDA were both more efficient in the use of
   computer time than ANN, and also more straightforward in providing
   testable hypotheses about environmental effects on occurrence. However,
   LR was apparently subject to chance significant effects from explanatory
   variables, emphasising the well-known risks of models based purely on
   correlative data. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A sequential testing procedure for monitoring epidemiological data is
   considered. The approach is based on a discrete time process of interim
   analyses using the likelihood ratio as a test statistic. Sampling
   continues until either some predetermined practical time limit is
   reached or a decision can be made about the hazard rates characterizing
   the populations to be compared. The stopping boundaries of the
   sequential testing procedure are determined so as to control type I
   error at a given level during the whole study. Thus, the critical
   threshold is derived from the exact distribution of the maximum value of
   the test statistic which is observed across all the monitoring times. To
   this end, the appropriate quantiles in the probability distributions of
   interest are obtained empirically by Monte Carlo simulation, assuming
   both the null hypothesis and given experimental conditions. The method
   is illustrated by an example concerning the incidence of leukaemia in
   young people living in the vicinity of the French La Hague nuclear
   reprocessing plant. On the whole the previous analyses do not provide
   evidence for a spatial-temporal clustering of leukaemia, at least within

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The spatial requirements of populations ought to be central to
   developing conservation strategies and ecological theory, but they are
   difficult to identify from the published collection of reported
   population estimates. Transforming population estimates into density and
   log values may have clouded recognition of the discontinuous
   relationship that exists between abundance estimates and the areas
   within which they were made. I used abundance estimates of terrestrial
   mammalian Carnivora to identify scale domains of abundance. In scale
   domain A, the study areas were too small to include all the individuals
   of the population, and abundance estimates increased proportionally with
   study area size. Scale domain B included high variation in abundance
   estimates, but these-estimates no longer increased with increasing size
   of study area as they did in domain A. I refer to the smallest area in
   the scale domain B as the `threshold area' (the minimum area known to
   support a population of the particular species). The abundance in scale
   domain B averaged 52 individuals amongst all but three outlier species.
   Scale domains C and D were also identified, and included much larger
   study areas and substantially larger abundance estimates.
   The threshold area is the first empirically-derived representation of
   the minimum space used by populations of each species. However, nearly
   half of all carnivore abundance estimates were made in areas smaller
   than the threshold area, and only 4\% could be used to represent
   transitions between scale domains B, C and D. The remainder varied
   within domains B, C and D due to variation in environmental conditions
   and research methods. Most comparisons of density between sites and
   between species have been made without considering whether the estimates
   represented the true population or some collection of individuals more
   or less abundant than the population. Threshold area can be used as a
   standard area against which to estimate and compare population density,
   in lieu of more appropriately comparing estimates of region-wide
   density, which generally do not yet exist. Also, threshold area could be
   predicted with reasonable error rates based on a typical species' body
   mass, brain mass and home range size. Therefore, conservation biologists
   may now have a tool to identify the minimum habitat areas needed to
   conserve populations of carnivore species, and theoretical ecologists
   can relate ecological space at the population level to allometric
   variables.}},

Title = {{Climatic signals in the life histories of insects: the distribution and
   abundance of heather psyllids (Strophingia spp.) in the UK}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{83-95}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. The population density and age structure of two species of heather
   psyllid Strophingia ericae and Strophingia cinereae, feeding on Calluna
   vulgaris and Erica cinerea, respectively, were sampled using
   standardized methods at locations throughout Britain. Locations were
   chosen to represent the full latitudinal and altitudinal range of the
   host plants.
   2. The paper explains how spatial variation in thermal environment,
   insect life-history characteristics and physiology, and plant
   distribution, interact to provide the mechanisms that determine the
   range and abundance of Strophingia spp.
   3. Strophingia ericae and S. cinereae, despite the similarity in the
   spatial distribution patterns of their host plants within Britain,
   display strongly contrasting geographical ranges and corresponding
   life-history strategies. Strophingia ericae is found on its host plant
   throughout Britain but S. cinereae is restricted to low elevation sites
   south of the Mersey-Humber line and occupies only part of the
   latitudinal and altitudinal range of its host plant. There is no
   evidence to suggest that S. ericae has reached its potential altitudinal
   or latitudinal limit in the UK, even though its host plant appears to
   reach its altitudinal limit.
   4. There was little difference in the ability of the two Strophingia
   spp. to survive shortterm exposure to temperatures as low as - 15
   degrees C and low winter temperatures probably do not limit distribution
   in S. cinereae.
   5. Population density of S. ericae was not related to altitude but
   showed a weak correlation with latitude. The spread of larval instars
   present at a site, measured as an index of instar homogeneity, was
   significantly correlated with a range of temperature related variables,
   of which May mean temperature and length of growing season above 3
   degrees C (calculated using the Lennon and Turner climatic model) were
   the most significant. Factor analysis did not improve the level of
   correlation significantly above those obtained for single climatic
   variables. The data confirmed that S. ericae has a I year life cycle at
   the lowest elevations and a 2 year life cycle at the higher elevations.
   However, there was no evidence, as previously suggested, for an abrupt
   change from a one to a 2 year life cycle in S. ericae with increasing
   altitudes or latitudes.
   6. By contrast with S. ericae, S. cinereae had an obligatory 1 year life
   cycle, its population decreased with altitude and the index of instar
   homogeneity showed little correlation with single temperature variables.
   Moreover, it occupied only part of the range of its host plant and its
   spatial distribution in the UK could be predicted with 96\% accuracy
   using selected variables in discriminant analysis.
   7. The life histories of the congeneric heather psyllids reflect
   adaptations that allow them to exploit host plants with different
   distributions in climatic and thereby geographical space. Strophingia
   ericae has the flexible life history that enables it to exploit C.
   vulgaris throughout its European boreal temperate range. Strophingia
   cinereae has a less flexible life history and is adapted for living on
   an oceanic temperate host. While the geographic ranges of the two
   Strophingia spp. overlap within the UK, the psyllids appear to respond
   differently to variation in their thermal environment.}},

Abstract = {{Complex binary traits have a dichotomous phenotypic expression but do
   not show a simple Mendelian segregation ratio. These traits are
   considered to be jointly controlled by the actions of several genes and
   a random environmental effect. The binary phenotype and the underlying
   factor are assumed to be linked through a threshold model. The
   underlying factor, referred to as the liability, is treated as a regular
   but unobservable quantitative character. Mapping quantitative trait loci
   (QTL) can be performed directly on the liability. Methods of QTL mapping
   for the liability of a complex binary trait have been well developed in
   line-crossing experiments. However, such a method is not available in
   outbred populations which usually consist of many independent pedigrees
   (families). In this study, we develop a method to analyse jointly
   multiple families of an outbred population. The method is developed
   based on a fixed-model approach, i.e. the QTL effects, rather than the
   variance, are estimated and tested. After the test, the estimated
   effects are then converted into a single estimate of the QTL variance by
   taking into consideration errors in the estimated effects. The QTL
   effects and variance-covariance matrix of the estimates are obtained by
   a fast Fisher-scoring method. Monte Carlo simulations show that the
   method is not only powerful but also generates very accurate estimates
   of QTL variances.}},

Abstract = {{The self-cycling fermentation (SCF) technique for cell cultivation is a
   useful tool for studying microorganisms. To date, this method has only
   been applied to aerobic systems, since dissolved oxygen has been used
   exclusively as the feedback control parameter, which defines this
   technique. To extend the range of redox environments to which the SCF
   can be applied, an alternate measurement is required. Transient
   oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and carbon dioxide evolution were
   screened as potential feedback control parameters in a denitrifying
   system. The characteristic change in slope of the transient ORP profile
   commonly referred to as the ``nitrate break point{''} was found to be a
   useful indicator of complete removal of oxidized nitrogen only in the
   presence of significant quantities of nitrate. An inflection point
   occurring after the break point was found to be a more general indicator
   of oxidized nitrogen removal. A control strategy based upon real-time
   detection of the inflection point was found to result in robust
   operation of the SCF. When variable amounts of nitrate (0-930 mg L-1)
   and nitrite (0-300 mg L-1) were added to the reactor each cycle, the
   control strategy automatically adjusted the cycle time, resulting in an
   effluent containing less than 1 mg L-1 of each of the oxidized nitrogen
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been a growing trend toward using stochastic
   (probabilistic) methods in ecological and public health risk assessment
   These methods are favored because they overcome the problem of
   compounded conservatism and allow the systematic consideration of
   uncertainty and variability typically encountered in risk assessment
   This article demonstrates a new methodology for the analysis of
   uncertainty in risk assessment using the first-order reliability method
   (FORM). The reliability method is formulated such that the probability
   that incremental lifetime cancer risk exceeds a predefined threshold
   level is calculated Furthermore, the stochastic sensitivity of this
   probability with respect to the random variables is provided. The
   emphasis is on exploring the different types of probabilistic
   sensitivity obtained through the reliability analysis. The method is
   applied to a case study given by Thompson at al. (1992) on cancer risk
   resulting from dermal contact with benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)-contaminated
   soils. The reliability results matched those of the Monte Carlo
   simulation method. On average, the Monte Carlo simulation method
   required about 35 times as many function evaluations as that of FORM to
   calculate the probability of exceeding the target risk level. The
   analysis emphasizes the significant impact that the uncertainty in
   cancer potency factor has on the probabilistic modeling results compared
   with other parameters.}},

Abstract = {{An electronic nose instrument was evaluated for its ability to monitor

   thresholds. Such methods are time consuming, labor intensive, and
   subject to large variation between analyses. An electronic nose,
   consisting of a nonspecific sensor array, could offer a more objective
   means of measuring odors emanating from water and wastewater. Monitoring
   of quiescent wastewater liquors from three treatment works over an
   8-month period showed that an electronic nose could distinguish between
   wastewater samples of different types and origins. Threshold odor
   numbers obtained from olfactometry analysis were correlated with
   electronic nose output for wastewater odors from 10 treatment works.
   Results suggested that no universal relationship exists between these

Abstract = {{There is a great need for simple but realistic methods for assessing
   status and management prescriptions for declining plants in fragmented
   landscapes. In this study we discuss a method for estimating extinction
   thresholds for metapopulations, based on analyses of site occupancy and
   recruitment of 18 species characteristic of semi-natural grasslands in
   Scandinavia. The extinction threshold refers to the fraction of
   remaining suitable habitat at which a species becomes extinct. Site
   suitability was estimated from sowing experiments and occupancy was
   estimated from site inventories. A comparison between the estimated
   extinction thresholds and remaining suitable habitats indicated that a
   decline in species diversity would accompany a further reduction of
   suitable habitat. An alternative `quasi-equilibrium' extinction
   threshold was also tested based on the assumption that there is a delay
   in population decline. With this approach, eight of the 18 selected
   species presently live `below' the extinction threshold. In order to
   estimate the accuracy of the methods, we made a tentative comparison of
   the results with knowledge of species status from other sources of
   information. We suggest that three species, Agrimonia eupatoria,
   Antennaria dioica, and Gentianella campestris may experience further
   decline in Scandinavia in the near future. Studies of occupancy,

Abstract = {{Sedimentary Cu bioavailability during deposit feeding is determined by
   both the digestive physiology of the organisms and the geochemistry of

   using a biomimetic approach involving extraction of Cu with digestive
   fluids of two deposit feeders and one suspension feeder and a
   geochemical approach measuring Cu associated with acid-volatile sulfide
   (AVS) in sediments. Cu bioavailability determined by the biomimetic
   method varied among species with varying digestive physiology but all
   showed a marked increase when SEMCu-AVS greater than or equal to 0,
   corroborating the premise underlying the AVS method in determining
   sedimentary Cu bioavailability. The existence of a positive SEMCu-AVS
   threshold (0.4-1.5 mu mol/g-sediment) suggests the existence of
   additional Cu-binding phases or mixed Cu(I)-Cu(II) sulfides in
   sediments. In addition, Cu bioavailable to digestive fluids was much
   less than that measured as SEMCu-AVS, indicating that the AVS method
   overestimates Cu bioavailability to digestive fluid of deposit feeders.
   Incubation of digestive fluids with two Cu-bound model phases, goethite

   threshold limit Values continues, the focus should be on the
   environmental aspect as the ultimate limiting factor with respect to
   measurement. The charcoal tube/carbon disulfide desorption procedure is
   slowly being stretched to its limit with respect to benzene. It may be
   time for serious consideration in North America regarding adoption of
   the proven European procedure of thermal desorption using a porous

Abstract = {{In environmental studies attention increasingly focuses on
   identification of spatial extremes: locations with observations that are
   apparently higher than either a preset background threshold or
   neighbouring observations. We consider various procedures for
   identifying values and locations of these extremes: extreme value
   theory, conditionally simulated fields and disjunctive kriging. In a
   recent research project we studied the distribution of nine
   environmental pollutants (heavy metals, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and
   mineral oil) in a large industrial estate in the southern Netherlands.
   This area is interesting as it is influenced by three contaminating
   processes: inundation by the river Meuse, anthropogenic heightening with
   contaminated materials and local industrial activities. Concentrations
   are measured. In this paper the peaks over threshold method was useful
   for finding extremes for spatially uncorrelated variables, whereas
   conditional simulations applied in particular to areas with spatial
   dependence.}},

Title = {{Methodologies for incorporation of synergistic effects in the
   calculation of the Pollutant Standards Index}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{81-90}},
Abstract = {{The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed the
   Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) in order to provide the public with an
   overall assessment of daily air quality. PSI values are determined from
   measured concentrations of five criteria air pollutants: carbon
   monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate
   matter (PM-10). In general, the PSI can be considered a useful tool in
   the assessment of air quality as it relates to health effects. However,
   the current method of PSI calculation is subject to certain inherent
   limitations. These limitations include the fact that the PSI neglects
   the role of synergism between the individual pollutants in affecting air
   quality and health. It is very likely that the combination of certain
   pollutants is more harmful than each acting individually. Since the
   general population is exposed to more than one of the criteria
   pollutants at a given time, revising the current PSI methodology to
   account for such synergism would be useful and helpful to the public.
   In the current work, two methodologies for synergistic PSI calculation
   have been evaluated. The first option (Option 1) is dominated by the
   principle of threshold levels. When further research determines more
   accurate levels, the methodology may be of value for future synergistic
   PSI evaluations. The second option (Option 2) is an attempt to
   incorporate the correlation of pollutant concentrations with health
   effects (as determined by increased hospital admissions) into the
   synergism evaluation. The underlying philosophy of this methodology
   holds the most promise for accurate synergistic PSI calculation.
   Comprehensive research and experimentation would be beneficial in
   creating a more accurate PSI function equation.
   The main advantage of these hypothetical methodologies is that the
   current PSI method would still be valid for initial PSI calculation. The
   dissimilarity is in the calculation of the critical (i.e. reportable)
   PSI value. It is no longer a matter of the highest PSI value among the
   pollutants being an accurate representative of air quality. Instead,
   each of the PSI values obtained is applied to a separate equation to
   determine a synergistic PSI. When above-average pollutant concentrations
   are recorded, the possibility of synergistic behavior increases and
   would be demonstrated with the application of both options. The
   advantage of Option 1 (versus Option 2) is that the equation was derived
   from a recognized approach to synergism in combination with the ideas of
   threshold levels. The advantage of Option 2 is that it is an attempt to
   correlate concentration levels with health effects observed in the
   health industry. II is possible that a combination of both philosophies
   will eventually lead to the development of a synergistic PSI methodology
   worthy of approval by the EPA.}},

Abstract = {{Although land disposal of municipal and industrial wastewater is a

   resulting from the application of some wastewaters. This study was
   conducted to assess the effects of rangeland irrigation using treated
   process waters from in situ leaching (ISL) operations at the Highland
   Uranium Project in Wyoming. Irrigation water quality was evaluated based
   on guidelines developed by the U.S. Salinity Laboratory, and
   concentrations of Se, B, U, and Ra-226 were monitored in soil and
   vegetation for 6 yr. The effects of Se and B to forage grasses and
   wildlife were evaluated based on known toxicity thresholds obtained from
   the literature. Although the water is moderately saline (EC approximate
   to 2.8 dS m(-1)), the site maintains adequate leaching to control salt
   accumulation in the root zone. Selenium, B, U, and Ra-226 concentrations
   in grasses were within the natural ranges that have been documented in
   the literature, and were also below phytotoxic levels. Boron
   concentrations in both the irrigation waters and forage grasses were
   sufficiently low that they appear to pose no threat to livestock or
   waterfowl. Plant tissue Se concentrations were at or below the lowest
   reported tolerance level for livestock during most years, and also below
   the threshold for Se toxicity in pronghorn antelope. Therefore,
   sprinkler irrigation on rangeland appears to be a safe and practical
   wastewater disposal option at the Highland Uranium Project, and may be a
   practical method of wastewater disposal for other ISL operations as

Abstract = {{A malodorous chemical, 2-ethyl-5,5'-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane (2EDD) created
   a drinking water taste and odor episode in Pennsylvania (USA) during
   1992. The odor episode occurred as the result of a reaction between
   propionaldehyde and neopentyl glycol in the waste tank of a resin
   manufacturer. Samples of this waste water were extracted and analyzed.
   An in situ aqueous preparation of 2EDD was completed to demonstrate that
   2EDD could have formed under the conditions found in the waste water.
   The stability (fate) of 2EDD was studied at different aqueous pHs (pH3,
   5, 7, and 9). Some hydrolysis of 2EDD was found at pHs<7 after one week,
   but 2EDD appeared to be stable at pH 9. The odor characteristics and
   odor threshold of 2EDD were determined by the method of flavor profile
   analysis. The odor threshold concentration of 2EDD was found to be
   between 5 and 10 ng/l and was described as having a sweet, tutti fruitti
   odor (near the odor threshold concentration) and a burnt, sickening
   sweet odor at higher concentrations. This study also discovered that
   slight antagonism in chloraminated drinking water may occur at or near
   the threshold odor level of 2EDD. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Systematic toxicity testing, using conventional toxicology
   methodologies, of single chemicals and chemical mixtures is highly
   impractical because of the immense numbers of chemicals and chemical
   mixtures involved and the limited scientific resources. Therefore, the
   development of unconventional, efficient, and predictive toxicology
   methods is imperative. Using carcinogenicity as an end point, we present
   approaches for developing predictive tools for toxicologic evaluation of
   chemicals and chemical mixtures relevant to environmental contamination.
   Central to the approaches presented is the integration of
   physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) and
   quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling with
   focused mechanistically based experimental toxicology. In this
   development, molecular and cellular biomarkers critical to the
   carcinogenesis process are evaluated quantitatively between different
   chemicals and/or chemical mixtures. Examples presented include the
   integration of PBPK/PD and QSAR modeling with a time-course medium-term
   liver foci assay, molecular biology and cell proliferation studies,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analyses of DNA changes, and
   cancer modeling to assess and attempt to predict the carcinogenicity of
   the series of 12 chlorobenzene isomers. Also presented is an ongoing
   effort to develop and apply a similar approach to chemical mixtures
   using in vitro cell culture (Syrian hamster embryo cell transformation
   assay and human keratinocytes) methodologies and in vivo studies. The
   promise and pitfalls of these developments are elaborated. When
   successfully applied. these approaches may greatly reduce animal usage,
   personnel, resources, and time required to evaluate the carcinogenicity

Abstract = {{Two new units are proposed for the evaluation of indoor air quality
   using the decibel concept, which give a much better approximation of the
   human perception of odour intensity, compared to the CO(2) and total
   volatile organic compounds (TVOC) concentration scales: the decicarbdiox
   and the devitvoc. On the psychophysical scale according to Yaglou, the
   weakest odour that can be detected by the human smell sensors is equal
   to one, and corresponds to the lower limit of percentage dissatisfaction
   (PD) of 5.8\%. It is equivalent to: (1) a CO(2) threshold concentration
   of 485 ppm - 0 dB (odour CO(2)) - 0 dCd (decicarbdiox), and (2) a TVOC
   threshold concentration of 50 mu g m(-3) - 0 dB (odour TVOC) - 0 dTv
   (decitvoc). The upper limit is determined by the initial value of
   toxicity: (1) CO(2) - 15,000 ppm - 134 dCd, and (2) TVOC - 25,000
   g/m(-3) - 135 dTv. Optimal pollutant values (corresponding to PD=20\%)
   and admissible values (PD=30\%) for unadapted and adapted persons are
   calculated. Long-term tolerable values (determining the sick building
   syndrome range) and short-term tolerable values (the beginning of the
   toxic range) are also stated. The same system used to evaluate noise can
   be used to evaluate air quality. Additionally, the contribution of the
   individual constituents (at present acoustic and odour) to the overall
   quality of the environment can be ascertained. The new units dCd and dTv
   can express an increase or decrease in air contamination, e.g. by the
   use of air cleaners, new building materials etc. The proposed system of
   using dCd and dTv is compatible with BSR/ASHRAE 62-1989 R which can be
   used to deter mine the required volume of fresh air for ventilation by
   an improved method, which takes into account different levels of

Abstract = {{In contrast to conventional inputs (land, labor and capital) pesticides

   functions. The properties of functional forms commonly used in the
   literature imply increasing returns to the control input which reduces
   the control decision to a binary one. When several control methods are

   specific because of the interaction with the prevailing growing
   conditions. The analogous conclusions hold for nutrient inputs when
   considered jointly. To illustrate the implications of these results for

Abstract = {{The most marked effect of cage aquaculture in an environment is the
   output of suspended solids and dissolved nutrients, which in some cases
   have been shown to cause environmental degradation. Instead of using
   traditional methods built on technological solutions, integrated farming
   methods have been put forward as a mean for treating nutrients and
   particulate wastes from fish cage farming. However, the results from
   integrated experiments, where filter feeders have been used to absorb
   suspended particles from fish cages, have not in many cases resulted in
   the expected beneficial effects. By modelling the output of waste from a
   salmon cage cultivation and particle filtration by mussels, the
   following main constraints for using filter feeders for removing
   particles from fish cages were identified: (1) Suspended solids from the
   fish cages will be highly diluted by the large volume of water passing
   through the cages. During continuous feeding (demand feeding) the
   concentration of released suspended solids was low (0.06-0.3 mg l(-1)).
   Only when fish density in the cages was high prior to harvest, and water
   currents were slow (0.03-0.05 m s(-1)), the increase in released
   concentrations were > 0.1 mg l(-1). (2) Addition of feed in pulses
   showed a 3-30-fold increase in water particle concentration, but the
   short duration of a pulse and saturation of mussel feeding would make
   long term seston concentration more important for mussel growth. (3) The
   potential particle retention from a rich pulse was limited by mussel
   pseudofaeces threshold level. It is concluded that, in a co-cultivation
   of mussels and salmons, the ambient seston concentration is of greater
   importance in controlling mussel growth, and increases in suspended
   solids from the fish cages may contribute significantly only during
   periods of low plankton production. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The various criticisms of our test of the linear no-threshold theory of

   to the issues they raise are not very large and that even if they were
   implausibly large, the results of our study would not be much affected.
   I review the seven essentially independent methods we used to estimate
   smoking prevalence, all of which give the same results but most of
   which, including the most important, were ignored by Smith et al.;
   explaining our results by uncertainties in smoking data would require
   correlations between radon and smoking that are grossly implausible. Our
   use of measurements of radon, smoking, and lung cancer rates from
   different time periods is justified, and it is shown that if more recent
   lung cancer rates are used, the results are not changed. Problems in
   comparing Iowa data with our study are discussed. It is shown that many
   of their criticisms of our study are more applicable to the case-control
   and cohort studies that they endorse. Many of their conclusions are
   presented without valid supporting evidence. A simple procedure is
   suggested that can easily settle any questions about the validity of our

Abstract = {{1. A method for finding the consequences of long-term generalized press

   variables, enabling the calculation of probability distributions for the
   outcomes that are of interest.
   2. The method is used to investigate the effect of a cull of fur seals
   on fisheries in the Benguela ecosystem, using a 29-species foodweb for
   that system. In the case of Cape fur seals treated here, it is found
   that a cull of seals is more likely to be detrimental to total yields
   from all exploited species than it is to be beneficial.
   3. The influence of weak links on the effects of a cull is investigated.
   Using both consumption by each species and consumption of each species
   to define link strength, a clear threshold in link strength is found,
   indicating that 44\% of all links could be deleted from the foodweb
   without affecting the predictions significantly. Even using a criterion
   based on consumption by each species alone (conventional dietary
   proportion data), about the same number of links can be deleted without
   seriously affecting the predictions of the model. This is a very helpful

Abstract = {{Diatom assemblages and sulfur content in sediments were analyzed to
   clarify changes in the sedimentary environment of Kushu Lake, a coastal
   lake on Rebun Island in Hokkaido, Japan. Salinity variations were
   assessed by means of a diatom-based index of paleosalinity and the
   sedimentary sulfur content. This paper discusses the Holocene
   development of the lake, in relation to Holocene relative sea-level
   change. For paleoenvironmental interpretation of the lake development,
   the rationale of the threshold method (Anundsen et al., 1994) was
   applied.
   At ca. 8000 yr BP, a coastal embayment (paleo-Kushu Bay) resulted from
   marine ingression. The threshold elevation at the mouth of the
   paleo-Kushu Bay kept pace with the rising sea-level, resulting in its
   enclosure at the culmination of Holocene marine transgression (ca.
   6500-5000 yr BP). From predicted relative sea-level at ca. 6000 yr BP
   for Rebun Island (Nakada et al., 1991), the threshold may have been at
   least above - 3 to - 5 m altitude. A freshwater lake environment with
   strongly anoxic bottom conditions may have occurred from ca. 5500 to
   5100 yr BP. After an important episode of marine ingression, the lake
   was isolated completely from the open sea at ca. 4900 yr BP. The diatom
   record suggests that the maximum lacustrine extent occurred at ca.
   4900-3100 yr BP. Thereafter, water depth decreased at the lake margins.

Abstract = {{Sustainable land use planning requires an in depth analysis of the
   existing resources (localization, features, sensitivity to development)
   and an understanding of development characteristics (resource needs and
   collateral effects) in order to identify an use for the natural
   resources that will not prejudice future development. Activities must be
   developed where the necessary natural resources exist and only when the
   environment is capable of absorbing the impact of the development. In
   this context, various methodologies have been developed for determining
   a rational use of existing resources that anticipates the possible
   long-term effects on the environment of the decisions taken and that
   takes into consideration all the existing relations between the natural
   resources and the planned operations. Some of these methods use the
   `threshold' concept to establish the limits of the environment's ability
   to support the planned development. One of these methods is the UET
   (Ultimate Environmental Threshold), developed and applied during the
   creation of the Regional Plan for the Tatry National Park with the aim
   of identifying the environmental thresholds for tourism. The present
   study is concerned with evaluating the possibility of extending the
   application of the method to an area, such as the `Parco del Serio'
   (Italy), characterized by an environment rich in natural features but
   profoundly modified by human intervention, in order to define a `plan of
   the environmental preconditions' to be adopted during a sustainable
   planning process and which indicates the restrictions and the potential
   for development of human activities (with particular regards to tourism
   and recreational activities) in relation to the existing environmental
   resources and the ecological stability of the territory. This
   application of the UET method made use of the GIS (Geographical
   Information System) technology for the analysis and processing of the

Abstract = {{Potential increase in air temperature due to climatic change and
   inter-annual climatic variability and its impacts on crop productivity
   is of major concern to crop scientists. A number of physically-based
   models have been developed and applied to estimate crop-environment
   relationships. In the present study the performance of two such models
   (the YIELD and the CERES-Rice) are discussed. These two models are used
   to estimate bore rice productivity under normal and abnormal climate
   scenarios in Bangladesh. This study finds that bore rice productivity at
   Mymensingh predicted by the YIELD is higher than the prediction by the
   CERES-Rice. Productivity estimates for Barisal by these two models are
   almost identical. Assumptions of non-identical management practices,
   different soil characterization procedures, different methods for
   calculation of dry matter production by these two models and the range
   of diurnal temperature variations played an important role in
   productivity estimates. The YIELD model predicted the lengths of the
   growing season under the normal and abnormal thermal climate conditions
   and they are to be shorter than the lengths predicted by the CERES-Rice
   model. The YIELD model's assumption of higher threshold temperature and
   a relatively simple relationship between phenology and air temperature
   has produced such estimations (shorter growing season). The complex data
   required by CERES-Rice may be an impediment for its extensive use. If
   input data for the CERES-Rice is not available, the YIELD model can be
   considered as a possible tool for various applications in

Abstract = {{Weather patterns have tremendous variability from year-to-year which

   The likelihood for a given simulation year to exceed a threshold value
   at any given field can be computed based upon analysis of hundreds to
   thousands of model results where only yearly weather patterns are
   allowed to change. Although effective, this approach often cannot be
   used in regional exposure analysis due to the prohibitively large
   combination of fields and weather scenarios requiring simulation. A
   simple regression method has been developed to reduce modeling runs
   required for regional assessments through ranking of annual
   precipitation patterns for exceedence probability predictions with
   respect to edge-of-held pesticide runoff. A weather year can then be
   picked from a weather library and used with a deterministic model to
   estimate edge-of-held runoff at a certain yearly exceedence probability
   for the specific field in question. This methodology has proven robust
   enough for successful extrapolation to other states having diverse

Abstract = {{Nasal irritation and associated symptoms (e.g., nasal congestion,
   rhinorrhea, sinus headache) are important air-pollution-related health
   complaints, particularly-in so-called problem buildings. Individual
   differences in nasal irritant sensitivity are therefore of both clinical
   and regulatory interest. To document such differences, one must first
   functionally define perceptual acuity to airborne irritants. In an
   adaptation of an established sensory testing method, the authors used
   the odorless irritant carbon dioxide in an electronically controlled
   dilution apparatus to deliver brief (approximate to 3 s) pulses at
   controlled levels (10\%-70\%, vol/vol), synchronized with the
   inspiratory phase of the respiratory cycle. Investigators who use this
   apparatus can use a variant of the forced-choice paradigm for threshold
   determination to document nasal irritant sensitivity. The authors
   recruited 30 adult volunteers (17 males, 13 females; average age = 41 y,
   range 19-79 y) from a university laboratory complex and from the general
   community. Within this group, there was a skewed distribution of carbon
   dioxide thresholds (arithmetic mean = 28\%, geometric mean = 27\%
   {[}vol/vol]). In univariate analyses, geometric mean carbon dioxide
   thresholds differed significantly with respect to smoking status (36\%
   carbon dioxide in smokers versus 25\% in nonsmokers; p < .005), but not
   with respect to age, gender, or self-reported history of allergic
   rhinitis. In a multivariate analysis, gender also approached
   significance; females tended to show better perceptual acuity than males
   (p = .06). Neither self-reported ``vasomotor rhinitis{''} symptoms nor
   self-reported symptomatic reactivity to environmental tobacco smoke
   predicted carbon dioxide thresholds. Pulsed carbon dioxide is well
   tolerated by subjects who participate in a threshold detection task; the
   procedure yields a potential endpoint with which to compare individuals
   (and groups) with respect to nasal irritant perceptual acuity. The
   relationship between such acuity and nasal physiologic reactivity-as
   well as the generalizability of such measures to other, more
   environmentally realistic irritants-has yet to be defined.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The rapid decline in the extent and health of coastal salt marshes has
   created a need for nondestructive methods for evaluating the condition
   of salt marsh ecosystems. This paper describes simultaneous uses of held
   sampling and remote sensing approaches to understand salt marsh
   ecosystem functions and species distributions and discusses the
   implications for salt marsh monitoring using remote sensing. Three sites
   along the Petaluma River near the entrance into San Pablo Bay,
   California, which represented a range of soil salinity, water content,
   and nutrients, were studied. Standing biomass was directly assessed by
   field sampling and indirectly estimated through canopy reflectance. The
   sites were dominated by almost monotypic stands of Salicornia virginica,
   Spartina foliosa, and Scirpus robustus. For Salicornia, we found a
   positive relationship between salinity and biomass up to a threshold of
   42 g/kg, after which biomass declined monotonically with increasing
   salinity. No Scirpus or Spartina were found at soil salinities >20 g/kg.
   Although significantly different levels of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen
   were found in the interstitial water and soils at these sites, no strong
   relationships were found between biomass and nitrate nitrogen. Soil
   ammonium nitrogen, in contrast, was positively related to biomass. Soil
   redox and salinity increased with elevation and distance from the
   shoreline, while soil moisture and H2S decreased. Canopy biomass was
   estimable using remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices at 58-80\%
   accuracy depending on. species. Simple Vegetation Index (VI) and
   Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) measured by handheld
   field spectrometers were the best estimators of green biomass for high
   cover of Salicornia. Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Soil
   Adjusted and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (SARVI) gave the
   best estimates for Spartina while the Global Environment Monitoring
   Index (GEMI) was the best estimate for Scirpus. The relationships
   between vegetation indices and biomass were developed from field
   spectra. The VI was used to estimate spatial patterns of biomass across
   the salt marsh from Landsat satellite Thematic Mapper (TM) data. The TM
   image showed spatial patterns corresponding with species zones and
   biomass abundance. Narrow band reflectance features measured with a
   handheld spectrometer can be used to predict canopy plant water content
   (R-2 = 63\%). Interpolated estimates of water content from
   field-measured canopy reflectance were shown to relate to variation in
   salinity and soil moisture. Canopy water content was estimated from
   Airborne Advanced Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer data, which
   showed similar spatial patterns at the site. Results indicate that both
   biomass production and canopy water content can be accurately determined
   from remotely sensed spectral measures. Species-specific differences in
   these characteristics may be used for monitoring species distribution
   and abundance from airborne or satellite images.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the distribution of endangered species from habitat data is

   processes such as unsaturated habitat and species interactions.
   Consequently, if prediction errors are not placed in an ecological

   most widely used, measure of prediction accuracy is the number of
   correctly classified cases. There are other measures of prediction
   success that may be more appropriate. Strategies for assessing the

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{91-106}},
Abstract = {{The evidence of detrimental effects of ozone on vegetation in Europe,
   and the need to develop international control policies to reduce ozone
   exposures which are based on the effects of the pollutant, has led to
   attempts to define so-called critical levels of ozone above which
   adverse effects on trees, crops and natural vegetation may occur. This
   review is a critical assessment of the scientific basis of the concepts
   used to define critical levels for ozone and identifies the key
   limitations and uncertainties involved. The review focuses on the Level
   I critical level approach, which provides an environmental standard or
   threshold to minimise the effects of ozone on sensitive receptors, but
   does not seek to quantify the impacts of exceeding the critical level
   under field conditions. The concept of using the AOT (accumulated
   exposure over a threshold) to define long-term ozone exposure is
   demonstrated to be appropriate for several economically important
   species. The use of 40 ppb (giving the AOT40 index) as a threshold
   concentration gives a good linear fit to experimental data from open-top
   chambers for arable crops, but it is less certain that it provides the
   best fit to data for trees or semi-natural communities. Major
   uncertainties in defining critical level values relate to the choice of
   response parameter and species; the absence of data for many receptors,

   conditions from relatively shortterm open-top chamber experiments. The
   derivation of critical levels for long-lived organisms, such as forest
   trees, may require the use of modelling techniques based on
   physiological data from experimental studies. The exposure-response data
   which have been applied to derive critical levels should not be used to
   estimate the impacts of ozone over large areas, because of the
   uncertainties associated with extrapolation from the open-top chamber
   method, especially for forest trees, and because of spatial variation in
   atmospheric and environmental conditions, which may alter ozone uptake.

Abstract = {{Most currently recognized occupational exposure limits do not consider

Abstract = {{The problem of mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) using genetic
   marker information is of great interest to the mapping community. There
   are many statistical methods available for detecting and/or locating
   QTL, all of which depend on assumptions about the distribution of the
   quantitative trait values. The distribution of the trait values is
   affected by sample size, genetic marker density, missing data patterns,
   environmental noise, etc., all of which affect the distribution of the
   test statistic used to detect/locate QTL. Failure of the test statistic
   distribution to follow a standard statistical distribution is the
   subject of current research. In order to declare a significant QTL
   effect it is necessary first to understand the behaviour of the test
   statistic under the null hypothesis so that a critical value may be
   employed. In this paper we discuss the choices available for obtaining
   critical values (threshold values) used in locating QTL via interval
   mapping procedures. We investigate threshold values obtained by
   different means (analytical approximations and empirical) for the same
   level of significance (type I error rate) under a normality assumption
   (null hypothesis of no QTL). In addition, we explore the effect of
   deviations from normality of the trait values on the threshold value by
   comparing analytical approximations and empirical threshold values for
   simulated backcross and F-2 experiments, along with an actual
   experimental F-2 data set.}},

Title = {{The ecology of wildlife disease control: Simple models revisited}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{303-314}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Simple disease/host models are used to identify the ecological
   criteria governing the likely relative effectiveness of culling,
   sterilization and vaccination as methods of wildlife disease control.
   2. The models include non-linear host death or birth rate/density
   relationships, and non-linear disease contact rate/density
   relationships. The following conclusions are based on these simple
   homogeneous-mixing models, and may be modified by certain spatial
   effects such as territoriality and density-dependent settlement of
   dispersing hosts.
   3. The threshold density of susceptible hosts for elimination of a
   disease, relative to the disease-free carrying capacity, is largely
   determined by characteristics of the disease. For any given threshold,
   relative to the carrying capacity, the degree of control required to
   maintain the host density at this threshold is solely determined by
   ecological characteristics of the host.
   4. The sustained rate of control required to eliminate disease can be
   expressed, exactly or to a good approximation, in terms of the basic
   reproductive rate of the disease, R(0) the host density-independent
   birth and death rates, and the parameters describing non-linearities in
   the host density dependence and disease contact rate/density functions.
   5. In terms of the sustained rates of control (e.g. percentage per year)
   necessary to eliminate disease, sterilization is as effective as culling
   (i.e. it requires the same level of control effort). Culling is likely
   to be more effective than vaccination (i.e. requires a lower rate of
   control) when R(0) is high (> 3) or host density dependence acts on
   mortality rather than recruitment. When R(0) is low (< 3) and density
   dependence in the host acts on recruitment rather than overall
   mortality, then either culling or vaccination can be more effective
   depending on the ratio of the maximum host death rate to its intrinsic
   rate of increase, and the non-linearity in the host density dependence
   and/or the disease contact rate/density relationship; vaccination is
   favoured by a low death rate relative to r, the host intrinsic rate of
   increase, and by non-linear density relationships.
   6. For a combined strategy of culling and vaccination, the total rate of
   control required to eliminate disease exceeds that for at least one of
   the strategies in isolation; to this extent the combined control is less
   effective.
   7. Using the above criterion for comparison, for all six published case
   studies considered as examples, culling is theoretically the most
   effective control strategy given the authors' assumptions in the
   original models. More recent data for possum density dependence suggests
   that vaccination could more closely match culling in effectiveness. The
   extent to which vaccination appears more effective in practice, in cases
   like fox rabies in Europe, probably reflects the spatial behaviour of
   the host not considered in these simple models.
   8. Comparing strategies on the basis of the relative rates at which they
   reduce endemic disease or the density of susceptible hosts, gives
   different results. In particular, sterilization is less effective than
   vaccination, and very much less effective than culling. Non-linearities
   in the density relationships greatly increase the effectiveness of
   vaccination relative to culling and sterilization, but the distinction
   between host density-dependent mortality or recruitment is no longer
   important.
   9. The biological reasons for these conclusions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Studies evaluated muff-type hearing protection devices (HPDs) in a
   mining environment. Noise reduction measurements were made using
   miniature microphones inside and outside the HPD cup. Laboratory tests
   conducted prior to field evaluations indicated that the results of this
   physical method were similar to the results of the American National
   Standards institute (ANSI) real-ear-attenuation-at-threshold method. A
   total of 23 models of HPDs and 545 machines (20 different machine types)
   were evaluated in the field phase, resulting in 1265 HPD evaluations.
   The effectiveness of each HPD model in terms of dBA noise reduction is
   presented as a function of the metric (C-A), which characterizes the
   spectrum of the machine noise. The dBA reductions for various
   combinations of HPD models and machine types are also presented. The
   results show that the field performance of muff-type HPDs is
   significantly less than that specified by the Environmental Protection
   Agency Noise Reduction Rating (NRR), especially for low-frequency noise
   sources such as internal combustion engines. Thirty-two percent of the
   operators of such machines observed noise reductions of 10 dBA or less.
   Across all machine types, 20\% of the workers realized an observed noise
   reduction of 10 dBA or less. it is concluded that the NRR grossly
   overestimates HPD performance, in addition, the NRR is not a good
   indicator for comparing HPD models since in many instances HPDs with
   lower NRRs out-performed those with higher NRRs. The laboratory-derived
   NRRs' failure to predict the HPD field performance was related primarily
   to the inaccuracy of the basic laboratory attenuation data from which
   the NRRs were computed, and to a lesser extent to shortcomings in the
   NRR computational procedure.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{79-102}},

Abstract = {{Based on imperfect data and theory, agencies such as the United States
   Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) currently derive `'reference
   doses'' (RfDs) to guide risk managers charged with ensuring that human
   exposures to chemicals are below population thresholds. The RfD for a
   chemical is typically reported as a single number, even though it is
   widely acknowledged that there are significant uncertainties inherent in
   the derivation of this number.
   In this article, the authors propose a probabilistic alternative to the
   EPA's method that expresses the human population threshold as a
   probability distribution of values (rather than a single RfD value),
   taking into account the major sources of scientific uncertainty in such
   estimates. The approach is illustrated using much of the same data that
   USEPA uses to justify their current RfD procedure.
   Like the EPA's approach, our approach recognizes the four key
   extrapolations that are necessary to define the human population
   threshold based on animal data: animal to human, human heterogeneity,
   LOAEL to NOAEL, and subchronic to chronic. Rather than using available
   data to define point estimates of `'uncertainty factors'' for these
   extrapolations, the proposed approach uses available data to define a
   probability distribution of adjustment factors. These initial
   characterizations of uncertainty can then be refined when more robust or
   specific data become available for a particular chemical or class of
   chemicals.
   Quantitative characterization of uncertainty in noncancer risk
   assessment will be useful to risk managers who face complex trade-offs
   between control costs and protection of public health. The new approach
   can help decision-makers understand how much extra control cost must be
   expended to achieve a specified increase in confidence that the human
   population threshold is not being exceeded.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the relationship between pattern and scale is a central
   issue in landscape ecology. Pattern analysis is necessarily a critical
   step to achieve this understanding. Pattern and scale are inseparable in
   theory and in reality. Pattern occurs on different scales, and scale
   affects pattern to be observed. The objective of our study is to
   investigate how changing scale might affect the results of landscape
   pattern analysis using three commonly adopted spatial autocorrelation
   indices, i.e., Moran Coefficient, Geary Ratio, and Cliff-Ord statistic.
   The data sets used in this study are spatially referenced digital data
   sets of topography and biomass in 1972 of Peninsular Malaysia. Our
   results show that all three autocorrelation indices were
   scale-dependent. In other words, the degree of spatial autocorrelation
   measured by these indices vary with the spatial scale on which analysis
   was performed. While all the data sets show a positive spatial
   autocorrelation across a range of scales, Moran coefficient and
   Cliff-Ord statistic decrease and Geary Ratio increases with increasing
   grain size, indicating an overall decline in the degree of spatial
   autocorrelation with scale. The effect of changing scale varies in their
   magnitude and rate of change when different types of landscape data are
   used. We have also explored why this could happen by examining the
   formulation of the Moran coefficient. The pattern of change in spatial
   autocorrelation with scale exhibits threshold behavior, i.e., scale
   effects fade away after certain spatial scales are reached (for
   elevation). We recommend that multiple methods be used for pattern
   analysis whenever feasible, and that scale effects must be taken into
   account in all spatial analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of irrigation with secondary treated municipal effluent on
   the accumulation of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) was
   investigated by monitoring sites that had been irrigated with effluent
   for 4 and 17 years. At Wodonga, seven tree species were sprinkler
   irrigated with effluent at an average application rate of 1347 mm per
   annum from 1980 to 1984. The other site at Canberra was a large grass
   playing field (9 ha), half of which had been effluent irrigated since
   1977. The non-effluent irrigated area served as the control area and
   provided reference `background' concentrations to assess the extent of
   contamination due to 17 years of effluent irrigation. Archived soil
   samples collected before the commencement of effluent irrigation were
   compared with those taken in 1984 at Wodonga to assess the extent of
   contamination. The concentration of labile metals was determined by
   extraction with EDTA because this method provides a quantitative measure
   of bioavailable metals. Irrigation with effluent did not increase the
   EDTA-extractable metals concentration at either site. Furthermore, the
   EDTA-extractable metal values were within the natural `background' range
   reported for Australian soils. These data suggest that it may take
   between 50 and 100 years for heavy metal levels (mainly Cd) in
   effluent-irrigated soil to reach the currently proposed threshold values

   accumulation of heavy metals on plant growth cannot be ignored and could

Abstract = {{Plutonium contamination of soils around Rocky Flats Environmental \&
   Technology Site, near Golden, Colorado, resulted from past outdoor
   storage practices and subsequent remobilization due to inadequate
   cleanup practices, Until now human-health risk assessment has not been
   performed because of a lack of sufficient information regarding the
   spatial extent of Pu-239+240 in soils, The purpose of this work was to
   elucidate the extent of plutonium contamination in surface soils, and to
   assess the uncertainty associated with the spatial distribution of
   Pu-239+240 around Rocky Flats Environmental \& Technology Site. Four
   data sets were collected or compiled for this investigation: (1) samples
   collected from 240 plots of 1.01- or 4.05-hectare by compositing 25
   evenly-spaced samples from the upper 0.64 cm in each plot; (2) samples
   collected from the upper 5 cm of soil in 167 of the same 240 plots by
   compositing 10 samples from the center of each plot; (3) historical data
   compiled from samples collected between 1969 and 1973, considered to be
   the most indicative of the original release; and (4) the exhaustive data
   set that contains the samples from 1, 2, and 3 and other published data
   sets collected between 1974 and 1994. These latter samples varied in
   depth and method of sampling. Plutonium activity reported in the
   exhaustive data set ranged from 0.03 Bq kg(-1) to 407,000 Bq kg(-1) with
   a mean of 1,443 Bq kg(-1), median of 6.6 Bq kg(-1), standard deviation
   of 18,463 Bq kg(-1), and a coefficient of variation of 12.6. The
   technique of nonparametric indicator kriging was used to model four
   conditional cumulative distribution functions of Pu-239+240 in soils
   around Rocky Flats Environmental \& Technology Site, Each of the
   conditional cumulative distribution functions was used to generate an
   E-type (mean of the conditional cumulative distribution functions)
   surface, The resulted surfaces were consistent with the hypothesis that
   the westerly winds were the dominant mechanism of plutonium dispersal.
   Other processes, such as downstream transport of sediment along local
   southeast-trending drainages, may have additionally moved small amounts
   of plutonium, The conditional cumulative distribution functions were
   also used to construct probability of exceedance maps of Pu-239+240 in
   soils, For the purpose of this report two threshold values for the
   probability maps were selected: (1) the mean and the highest measured
   global fallout of plutonium (1.48 and 2.96 Bq kg(-1), respectively); and
   (2) the programmatic preliminary remediation goal for residential
   occupancy scenario (126 Bq kg(-1)). The probability-of-exceedance maps
   provide estimates of spatial uncertainty associated with each threshold,
   The E-type maps in conjunction with the probability-of-exceedance maps
   provide a robust framework for future cleanup options and land use
   decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Ozone critical levels in Europe are defined in terms of an accumulated
   exposure over a threshold of 40 ppb, AOT40. For agricultural crops, for
   example, the critical level is an AOT40 of 5300 ppb.h during daylight in
   May to July in the year with the highest cumulative exposure in the last
   five years. In a region of the size of the UK, however, the worst case
   year is not the same over the whole region and maps become difficult to
   interpret. Prediction of crop losses on the basis of a single year out
   of five also wastes potentially valuable information. An alternative
   approach estimates the distribution of aggregate exceedances over a
   threshold by means of a compound Poisson model for episodes of raised
   ozone concentration with linear modelling techniques used to allow
   direct incorporation of covariate information. The use of spatial and
   environmental covariates, along with temporal and spatially correlated
   random effects, is explored using data from the UK ozone monitoring
   network. The model produces results similar to those from other mapping
   methods. By combining this model with a crop loss relationship, crop
   losses of 5-15\% for the UK are predicted but the errors range between
   2\% and 6\% indicating that fine detail in crop loss mapping is unlikely
   to be very accurate.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the theoretical consequences of character evolution
   for the population dynamics of a host-parasitoid interaction, assuming a
   monophagous parasitoid. In the purely ecological model it is assumed
   that hosts can escape parasitism by being in absolute refuges. A
   striking property of this model is a threshold effect in control of the
   host by the parasitoid, when host density dependence is weak. The
   approximate criteria for the parasitoid to regulate the host to low
   densities are (1) that the parasitoid's maximum population growth rate
   should exceed the host's and (2) that the maximum growth rate of the
   host in the refuge should be less than unity. We then use this
   ecological framework as a basis for a model which considers evolutionary
   changes in quantitative characters influencing the size of the absolute
   refuge. For each species, an increase in its refuge-determining
   character comes at a cost to maximum population growth rate. We show
   that refuge evolution can substantially alter the population dynamics of
   the purely ecological model, resulting in a number of emergent and
   sometimes counter-intuitive properties. In general, when the host has a
   high carrying capacity, systems are polarized either with low or minor
   refuge and `top-down' control of the host by the parasitoid or with a
   refuge and `bottom-up' control of the host by a combination of its own
   density dependence and the parasitoid. A particularly tantalizing result
   is that co-evolutionary dynamics can modify ecologically unstable
   systems into ones which are either stable or quasi-stable (with bouts of
   unstable dynamics, punctuating long-term periods of quasi-stable
   behaviour). We present five quantitative criteria which must all be met
   for the parasitoid to be the agent responsible for control of the host
   at a co-evolutionary equilibrium. The apparent stringency of this full
   set of requirements supports the empirically-based suggestion that
   monophagous parasitoid-driven systems should be less common in nature
   than those driven by multiple forms of density dependence. Further, we
   apply our theory to the question of whether exploiters may `harvest'
   their victims at maximum sustainable yields and to the evolutionary
   stability of biological control. Finally, we present a series of
   testable predictions of our theory and methods useful for testing them.}},

Abstract = {{Threshold values are of prime importance in providing a sound basis for
   public health decisions. A key issue is determining threshold or maximum
   exposure values For pollutants and assessing their potential health
   risks. Environmental epidemiology could be instrumental in assessing
   these levels, especially since the assessment of ambient exposures
   involves relatively low concentrations of pollutants. This paper
   presents a statistical method that allows the determination of threshold
   values as well as the assessment of the associated risk using a
   retrospective, longitudinal study design with a prospective follow-up.
   Morbidity data were analyzed using the Fourier method, a time-series
   analysis that is based on the assumption of a high temporal resolution
   of the data. This method eliminates time-dependent responses like
   temporal inhomogeneity and pseudocor-relation. The frequency of calls
   for respiratory distress conditions to the regional Mobile Medical
   Emergency Service (MMES) in the city of Leipzig were investigated. The
   entire population of Leipzig served as a pool for data collection. In
   addition to the collection of morbidity data, air pollution measurements
   were taken every 30 min for the entire study period using sulfur dioxide
   as the regional indicator variable. This approach allowed the
   calculation of a dose-response curve for respiratory diseases and air
   pollution indices in children and adults. Significantly higher
   morbidities were observed above a 24-hr mean value of 0.6 mg SO2/m(3)
   air for children and 0.8 mg SO2/m(3) for adults. Using the derived
   threshold value, the attributable risk for respiratory disease for
   children exposed to an increase, for example, from 0.6 to 1.2 mg
   SO2/m(3) air (24-hr mean) (i.e., a doubling of the threshold level) was
   30/10,000. For adults this risk was 2/10,000.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous ecological studies use Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for

   researcher when using PCA. An incorrect choice may lead to the
   underextraction of components, but commonly results in overextraction.
   Of several methods proposed to determine the significance of principal
   components, Parallel Analysis (PA) has proven consistently accurate in
   determining the threshold for significant components, variable loadings,
   and analytical statistics when decomposing a correlation matrix. In this
   procedure, eigenvalues from a data set prior to rotation are compared
   with those from a matrix of random values of the same dimensionality (p
   variables and n samples). PCA eigenvalues from the data greater than PA
   eigenvalues from the corresponding random data can be retained. All
   components with eigenvalues below this threshold value should be
   considered spurious. We illustrate Parallel Analysis on an environmental
   data set.
   We reviewed all articles utilizing PCA or Factor Analysis (FA) from 1987
   to 1993 from Ecology, Ecological Monographs, Journal of Vegetation
   Science and Journal of Ecology. Analyses were first separated into those
   PCA which decomposed a correlation matrix and those PCA which decomposed
   a covariance matrix. Parallel Analysis (PA) was applied for each PCA/FA
   found in the literature. Of 39 analyses (in 22 articles), 29 (74.4\%)
   considered no threshold rule, presumably retaining interpretable
   components. According to the PA results, 26 (66.7\%) overextracted
   components. This overextraction may have resulted in potentially
   misleading interpretation of spurious components. It is suggested that
   the routine use of PA in multivariate ordination will increase
   confidence in the results and reduce the subjective interpretation of
   supposedly objective methods.}},

Abstract = {{Leaded paints are known to present a potential health risk if ingested. 
   There are several field screening and laboratory methods to determine if

   screening method is a colorimetric chemical reaction with the painted
   surface which is intended to produce qualitative `yes/no' results.  This
   method results in some small damage to the coated surface.  X-ray
   fluorescence is a nondestructive field screening device which can
   produce slightly more quantitative data although the results are often
   reported in reference to being above or below the HUD criteria.  US
   Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) laboratory methods to quantify
   lead in coated surfaces include atomic absorption (AA) and inductively
   coupled plasma (ICP).
   Three series of tests were conducted to determine the capability and
   characteristics of four field screening devices (three colorimetric, one
   X-ray fluorescence) to detect lead content on painted walls.  Laboratory
   analysis was used to determine base lead levels in the test paints.  The
   first test series evaluated the apparent detection threshold of three
   colorimetric field screening kits using the manufacturers' definition of
   a positive result.  The second series of tests examined the effect of
   multiple layers of leaded and nonleaded paints on the colorimetric and

   examined the qualitative effect of such things as paint color,
   application method, and surface preparation on three colorimetric test

Abstract = {{The ability of decomposers to process variable amounts of xenobiotics in

   prevent their accumulation and eventual ecotoxic effects. Since
   decomposition processes depend on environmental factors at the sediment
   which are difficult to mimic in laboratory systems, in situ evaluations
   in undisturbed sediments are of great interest. A method and its results
   are presented to evaluate the decomposition rates of PAHs (polynuclear
   aromatic hydrocarbons) in coastal undisturbed marine sediments at
   different levels of pollution input. The method is based on the
   application of pulse chromatography concepts to interpret trap and bed
   sediment monitoring data obtained at regular time intervals, using
   models of the water column as an anisotropic carrying medium. The
   results are for a 14 month data series from moderately polluted
   sediments near an urban site and at a more distant nearly pristine site
   on the south Atlantic coast. QSAR (quantitative structure activity
   relations) indicate that decay rates increase with higher UV absorption
   and lipidic solubility. At low levels of total PAH input to the
   sediments (<0.05 mu g day(-1) g(-1)), decomposition mechanisms
   effectively process these compounds within a few days. At higher input
   levels (up to 0.12 mu g day(-1) g(-1)), decomposition lags behind the
   inputs by approximately 25\% and PAHs accumulate in the sediment. In
   situ estimates of the PAH input/decay ratios provide reliable ecosystem
   indicators of a safe threshold for anthropogenic inputs of PAHs to the

Abstract = {{Environmental models are often highly nonlinear, and parameters have to
   be estimated from noisy data. The standard approach of locally
   linearizing the model, which leads to ellipsoid confidence regions, is
   inappropriate in this situation. A straightforward technique to
   characterize arbitrary-shaped confidence regions is to calculate model
   output on a grid of parameter values. Each parameter value P results in
   a goodness of fit G(P), which allows delineation of the set of
   parameters corresponding to G(P) < G(c), with G(c) some threshold
   level(e.g., 5\% probability). This approach is impractical and
   time-consuming for complex models, however. This article aims at finding
   an efficient alternative. It is first shown that the most general
   approach is to generate parameter values uniformly covering the set G(P)
   < G(c) rather than finding the boundary G(P) = G(c). It is argued that
   the most efficient method of generating a uniform cover is by a
   (theoretical) algorithm known as pure adaptive search CPAS); the
   presently proposed method (uniform covering by probabilistic rejection;
   UCPR) is shown to be a good approximation to PAS, The UCPR is compared
   with alternative methods for a number of test problems. It is
   illustrated that for complex models (where model run time dominates
   total computer time) UCPR is considerably faster and its cover of G(c)
   more uniform than existing alternatives. An intrinsic problem common to
   all methods is that the amount of work increases at least quadratically
   with the number of parameters considered, making them of limited use for
   high-dimensional problems.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic method for sampling spatially distributed contaminant level
   is presented. The purpose of sampling is to partition the contaminated
   region into zones of high and low pollutant concentration levels.  In
   particular, given an initial set of observations of a contaminant within
   a site, it is desired to find a set of additional sampling locations in
   a way that takes into consideration the spatial variability
   characteristics of the site and optimizes certain objective functions
   emerging from the physical, regulatory and monetary considerations of
   the specific site cleanup process. Since the interest is in classifying
   the domain into zones above and below a pollutant threshold level, a
   natural criterion is the cost of misclassification. The resulting
   objective function is the expected value of a spatial loss function
   associated with sampling. Stochastic expectation involves the joint
   probability distribution of the pollutant level and its estimate, where
   the latter is calculated by means of spatial estimation techniques.
   Actual computation requires the discretization of the contaminated
   domain. As a consequence, any reasonably sized problem results in
   combinatorics precluding an exhaustive search. The use of an annealing
   algorithm, although suboptimal, can find a good set of future sampling
   locations quickly and efficiently. In order to obtain insight about the

   densities over a large (225 x 150 km) area in northwestern Iowa during
   the summer of 1989. The results show the simulated density of rootworms
   to be influenced strongly by the choice of summary statistic and density
   threshold. Economic risk is appraised fram the point of view of the
   farmer by incorporating the expected economic losses due to the use of a
   soil insecticide. Since the cost to the farmer of not using an
   insecticide when in fact it is needed is over three times greater than
   the cost of using one when it is not needed, the area identified as
   potentially requiring treatment is much larger than when a summary
   statistic like the mean or median is used. Stochastic simulation allows
   the environmental researcher, policy-maker, or manager the opportunity
   to characterize uncertainty and economic or other losses, and to
   determine areas requiring treatment and additional samples.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental immunoassays can help lower the operating costs and
   improve the effectiveness of residue laboratories. The present study
   assesses the ability of a commercially available enzyme immunoassay
   (EIA) to detect triazine herbicides in water.  The tube based EIA could
   detect atrazine in lake and river water with detection limits of 62
   pg/mL and 180 pg/mL respectively. The assay's ability to quantify
   atrazine in a set of 124 water samples taken from many parts of Canada
   was compared with a reference method that used gas chromatographic
   separation combined with a nitrogen phosphorous detector (GC-NPD)
   (R-0.919). A 71 \% reduction in analytical load was achieved at a
   threshold concentration of 1 ng/mL. There were 2.4 \% false negative and
   0.8 \% false positive results associated with that load reduction. The
   variability of the assay control parameters was generally within two
   standard deviations of the mean response for 65 assays. The EIA for
   atrazine is recommended for use as a screening technique and as an
   inexpensive way to monitor triazine levels in waters that are known to
   be contaminated with those herbicides.}},

   subtle ecological effects of sediment contamination. To this end, a
   partial life-cycle test with the amphipod Leptocheirus plumulosus
   Shoemaker was evaluated for solid-phase testing of contaminated
   estuarine sediments. Initially, juvenile and adult Leptocheirus
   plumulosus and the amphipod Hyalella azteca were exposed to gradients of
   chemical contamination prepared by diluting field-collected contaminated
   sediment with texturally similar reference sediment. Ten-day exposure
   results indicate juvenile Leptocheirus plumulosus is more sensitive than
   adult Leptocheirus plumulosus and Hyalella azteca, with significant
   mortality of juvenile Leptocheirus plumulosus occurring in sediment
   diluted to 12.5\% of the adult lowest-observed-effect concentration
   (LOEC). Long-term exposure (30 d) of juveniles to dilutions of the acute
   juvenile LOEC shows significant effects on growth in sediment
   concentrations below the lethal threshold. Effects on reproductive end

   effects. Evaluation of nontoxicant experimental variables indicates
   significant effects of temperature and feeding regime on sensitivity of

Abstract = {{1. We develop a simple mathematical model to represent the population
   dynamics of barnacle geese wintering on Islay which allows the
   investigation of the effects of different management strategies, in
   particular different methods for the regulation of shooting.
   2. The available data do not allow us to distinguish whether the
   population is growing from a level well below its carrying capacity or
   fluctuating around a varying carrying capacity. We consider both
   situations but investigate the former in detail as this is likely to
   lead to increasing conflict with agriculture.
   3. Simple deterministic analysis demonstrates that, where there is no
   natural density dependence over the relevant range of densities, only
   those shooting strategies which impose density-dependent mortality on
   the population can control numbers effectively while maintaining a
   viable population.
   4. Analysis with the incorporation of environmentally driven variation
   establishes that strategies based on shooting a fixed proportion of the
   excess of females over some threshold in the previous year can prevent
   fluctuations to high numbers while not significantly reducing the modal
   time taken to drop to low numbers.
   5. Low levels of auto-correlation in the recruitment rate or of
   correlation between the birth rate and year-to-year survival do not
   greatly affect the distribution of times taken to reach low numbers;
   however, higher levels of either result in a decrease in the modal time
   taken to reach small population sizes.
   6. The results obtained for the model without the incorporation of
   natural density dependence provide a baseline level for the modal time
   to reach small population sizes. The incorporation of density dependence
   is unlikely to significantly reduce this further.
   7. Certain shooting strategies have the potential to regulate
   effectively the number of geese wintering on Islay, however, such
   methods are not in keeping with current British and European
   legislation.}},

Abstract = {{The use of flanking marker methods has proved to be a powerful tool for
   the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the segregating
   generations derived from crosses between inbred lines. Methods to
   analyse these data, based on maximum-likelihood, have been developed and
   provide good estimates of QTL effects in some situations.
   Maximum-likelihood methods are, however, relatively complex and can be
   computationally slow. In this paper we develop methods for mapping QTL
   based on multiple regression which can be applied using any general
   statistical package. We use the example of mapping in an F2 population
   and show that these regression methods produce very similar results to
   those obtained using maximum likelihood. The relative simplicity of the
   regression methods means that models with more than a single QTL can be
   explored and we give examples of two linked loci and of two interacting
   loci. Other models, for example with more than two QTL, with
   environmental fixed effects, with between family variance or for
   threshold traits, could be fitted in a similar way. The ease, speed of
   application and generality of regression methods for flanking marker
   analyses, and the good estimates they obtain, suggest that they should
   provide the method of choice for the analysis of QTL mapping data from

Abstract = {{Hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), has been classified as a human respiratory
   carcinogen. Airborne Cr(VI) emissions are associated with a number of
   industrial sources including metal plating, tanning, chromite ore
   processing, and spray painting operations; combustion sources such as
   automobiles and incinerators; and fugitive dusts from contaminated soil.
   There has been considerable interest within industry and the regulatory
   community to assess the potential cancer risks of workers exposed to
   Cr(VI) at levels substantially below the threshold limit value (TLV) of
   50-mu-g/m3. To date, only the workplace sampling and analytical method
   (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {[}NIOSH] Method
   7600) has been validated for measuring airborne Cr(VI), and it can
   accurately measure concentrations only as low as 500 ng/m3. This paper
   describes the field evaluation of a sampling and analytical method for
   the quantitation of airborne Cr(VI) at concentrations 5000 times lower
   than the current standard method (as low as 0.1 ng/m3) . The collection
   method uses three 500-mL Greenberg-Smith impingers in series, operated
   at 15 Lpm for 24 hr. All three impingers are filled with 200 mL of a
   slightly alkaline (pH approximately 8) sodium bicarbonate buffer
   solution. The results of validation tests showed that both Cr(VI) and
   trivalent chromium, Cr(III), were stable in the collection medium and
   that samples may be stored for up to 100 days without appreciable loss
   of Cr(VI). Method precision based on the pooled coefficient of variation
   for replicate samples was 10.4\%, and method accuracy based on the mean
   percent recovery of spiked samples was 94\%. Both the precision and
   accuracy of the impinger method were within NIOSH criteria. This method
   could be used to measure ambient concentrations of Cr(VI) in the
   workplace caused by fugitive emissions from manufacturing processes or
   chromium-contaminated soils at workplace concentrations well below the
   current TLV (50-mu-g/m3) or permissible exposure limit (100-mu-g/m3).}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal growth of the foliose lichens Xanthoparmelia lineola and X.
   subdecipiens was monitored for 26 mo at two transplant localities in a
   montane meadow on the East Slope of the Colorado Front Range. One of the
   transplant sites is exposed to strong westerly winds and is periodically
   scoured free of snow in winter. The other is sheltered from the wind and
   remains covered with snow for almost half the year. Differences in snow
   cover and lichen-drying rates at the two sites caused seasonal
   differences in radial growth: lichens grew faster at the
   snow-accumulation site than at the snow-free site in winter and summer,
   but faster at the snow-free site in spring. Long-term growth rates at
   the two localities were statistically identical; except for two thalli
   of X. subdecipiens whose threshold of tolerance for snow were exceeded,
   the costs and benefits of growing in a snowbed environment
   counterbalanced each other. To determine how snow affects long-term
   lichen growth rates at higher elevations, Rhizocarpon subgenus
   Rhizocarpon thalli were measured along an isochronous surface that
   traverses snow-free and snow-accumulation areas above timberline. No
   systematic differences in maximum diameter were recorded, despite large
   differences in duration of snow. The studies indicate that zoned lichen
   communities in the Colorado Front Range are more likely to have resulted
   from episodic snowkill than from slow growth beneath a seasonal snow
