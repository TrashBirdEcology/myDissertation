- For example, reef systems are relatively well-understood now
- So we know that if for example the  sea temps rise and sustaint high temps, 
- Or local acification occurs, 
- Then the algae will leave the corals, adn the corals will bleach and die

???
Ecosystems are 
- high dimensional, especially as we increase scale system extent
- which leads to a higher number of interactions
- increasingly realizing these are non-linear interactions
- non-ergodic
- because they are open, they are obviously dynamic.
- These characteristics, paired with our inability to perfectly observe the systems means that we cannot predict many shifts now,  
- Especially as we move beyonbd just a handful of state  variables.

- So, with the practical ecologist in mind, or basically anyone not able to spend a solid 4 years studying this literature and testing these methods but wishing to apply these methods, my dissertation focuses on the quantitative methods proposed for identifying ecological regime shfits
- Particularly I focus on the methods that are used for ecological community and systems, rather than single-species or single-state variable analyses.

- There are few problems motivating the studies conducted in this chpater

- The number of papers related to ecological regime shifts exploded in the mid 2000s, 
  - coinciding with scheffer and carpenter 2003 - ASS theory + resilience...
  
- __But despite the growth of__ RS-related publications, these concepts are rarely applied in natural resoruce mangement and policy

.small-med[
- Method review papers exist
  - None are comprehensive
    - Most comprehensive are out of date

]
???
- Using both prior knowledge AND lit review, I identified over 70 methods used in the ecol lit for detecting regime shifts
- However, less than half were identfied using standard boolean techniques 
 
- that is, without sufficient prior knowledge, the methods arent accessible to the practical ecologist


---
# Methods Emphasize Results and Not Method Efficacy <!--flowchart--> 
.center[<img src="figures/methodflow2.png" width="600">]
???
- Next, many 'new methods ' are first published as case studies rather than methods studies

- In other words, many do not emphasize and test the method statistically

- Rigorous testing required to improve both the methods and theory 
---

# Methods Not Concentrated in Methodological Journals 
<img src="figures/wosRegimePubsByJrnl_min4Pubs.png" width="875">
???
- ANd because many of the first instsances of these methods are published as presnetations of new and exciting results, rahter tahn as the boring and dull robustness and sensitivity tests

- Methodological jouranls are receiving fewer submissions than subdisciplinary adn applied or concepts jouranls

# Regime Detection Methods for Individual State Variables are Well-Tested <!--Ch3 Segue: Multivariate Methods -->

- Although these metrics have been shown useful in some conditions  and systems

- Their _utility in HIGH DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS is LESS OBVIOUS_

???
- This Step, the dimension reduction step, results in a measure which we are calling the "distance travelled"

- It is from this measure that the Fisher INfomration is calcualted, adn therefore, can be considered separaate from the Fisher calcualtion.

- Left panel is a single cycle

- Right is just the velocity over the entire time series

.left-column-2[<img src="figures/fiwinsize.png" width="660">]
???
- But note that this calualtion requires integration over some period of time, and 

- As a consequence, Fisher Informaiton is sensitive to the choice of the window width. 

- By varying the true cycle time based on the pre and post carry capacities, Fisher Information gives varying results. 

--

.right-column-2[.small-med[
- Sensitive to window size 

- But better if periodic

- If the correct window size is identified, FI may be a useful regime dtection method, however, 

- WOudl be best if the system is periodic

- And in the next two chapters I demonstrate the relative utility of using only the velocity measurement, rather than calculating the Fisher Information metric.
