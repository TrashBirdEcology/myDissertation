# Ecological Regime Shifts  <!-- what how goal -->

- One way the scientific community is attempting to foresee and avoid undesirable conseuqences (like bashing your face into an ice wall)
- is to develop and apply the concept of __ecological regime shifts__ ... next

- A **persistent change in the sturcture or functioning of a system**

## **how?** loss of negative feedback(s) maintaining the system
<br>
???
- Regime shifts occur, via a number of pathways, when a system **loses the negative feedback(s) maintaining** the system in its current state

- Again, *goal* is to predict in time to prevent something bad from happening. Pipe dream? Probably...
--

## **goal?** predict in time to prevent  
???
- goal is to predict regime shifts in time to either prevent or create a plan of action for timely mitigation

# Problem: Ecosystems are Complex <!--prediction is difficult in ecology...-->

.medium[
- high dimensional    
- many ( $\infty$ ) interactions  
- dynamic (time dependence)
- non-linear  
- non-ergodic (open)    
]
???
Ecosystems are 
- high dimensional, especially as we increase scale system extent
- which leads to a higher number of interactions
- increasingly realizing these are non-linear interactions
- non-ergodic
- because they are open, they are obviously dynamic.
--
<font color="blue">.medium[Especially difficult when drivers are unknown in a high dimensional system]</font>
???
- These characteristics, paired with our inability to perfectly observe the systems means that we cannot predict many shifts now,  
- Especially as we move beyonbd just a handful of state  variables.

- So, with the practical ecologist in mind, or basically anyone not able to spend a solid 4 years studying this literature and testing these methods but wishing to apply these methods, my dissertation focuses on the quantitative methods proposed for identifying ecological regime shfits

# Regime Detection Methods Difficult to Find Using Typical Literature Reviews <!--results: journals--> 
???
- I conducted a second litearture review in an attempt to build a comprehensive list of the methods proposed and applied for detecting eoclogical regime shifts
- Using a well-defined boolean search AND incorpoating my prior knowledge, <u>I identified over 70 methods </u> proposed or used to ID ecological regime shifts 

--

<img src="figures/wosRegimePubsByJrnl_min4Pubs.png" width="750">
- A few things contributed to my inability to build this list using typical lit search methods:
  1. Jargon is inconsistent
  2. Methods are not often first proposed in either methods journals, nor proposed using theoretical data
    - rather, they are applied using empirical data, and put into more 'applied journals'

- Ecologists are taking baby steps towards being able to make predition in ecology
- Easier done when system dynamics are UNDERSTOOD 
- When systems are well-described
- When conditions are predictable
- I think we have a long way until we are able to forecast most undesirable shifts in the environment, whcih some may refer to as regime shifts.

# Applications Exceed Regime Shift Theory and Method Efficacy  <!-- summarise diss findings-->

- Too many methods proposed
- Few rigorously tested
- Still no generalizable methods
- Some methods sensitive to data quality/quantity
  - but velocity appears robust
- Divergence of regime shift theory from dynamical systems theory
