- Society and the scientific community are increasingly valuing the ability to identify and understand the impacts we are having  
- One line of research trying to advance this area, is that of what some call, 'regime shifts'
- There are numerous definitions, but today we define regime shifts as

- Changes in the structure, or functioning of an ecological system...
- Most useful when related to some ecosystem service or function of interest to humans

# Can we detect & predict ecological regime shifts in under-described systems?

???

- Detecting and predicting change of less well-understood ecological systems is, arguably, the holy grail of ecology 
- As we will discuss later, there numerous quantitative methods proposed for doing just that 
- Yes, we can for some systems.

.footnote[ [1] Wikipedia ]

???
- Ecological regime shift theory was born out of dynamical systems theory, a branch of mathematics
- Of particular note are the existence of chaotic systems, or, systems which are unpredictible in most situations
- EX: the lorenz attractor

- The study of chaotic systems in mathematics is relatively new (1980s)


--

- That is, a system which exhibits time-dependence
- The Lorenz, or butterfly attractor, is a commonly used visualization of such a system  
- For example, somepredator-prey systems cna exhibit chaotic behavior reflecting the Lorenz attractor [^1]

and has very much diverged from the field
- When entering a new field of research or usign a new method, the practical ecologist might conduct a lit review
- Research surrounding ecological regime shifts and the methods used to identify them, however, are spread across disciplines, and subdisciplines.
- The same goes for when we are trying to identify best methods and best practices using methods on empirical data
- This, however is a difficult feat in the regime shift literature
