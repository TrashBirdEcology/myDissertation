- For example, reef systems are relatively well-understood now
- So we know that if for example the  sea temps rise and sustaint high temps, 
- Or local acification occurs, 
- Then the algae will leave the corals, adn the corals will bleach and die

- Predicting shifts more difficult ]

- Ecosystems are complex
  - high dimensional    
  - many ( $\infty$ ) interactions  
  - dynamic (time dependence)
  - non-linear

???
Ecosystems are 
- high dimensional, especially as we increase scale system extent
- which leads to a higher number of interactions
- increasingly realizing these are non-linear interactions
- non-ergodic
- because they are open, they are obviously dynamic.
- These characteristics, paired with our inability to perfectly observe the systems means that we cannot predict many shifts now,  
- Especially as we move beyonbd just a handful of state  variables.

- Particularly I focus on the methods that are used for ecological community and systems, rather than single-species or single-state variable analyses.

- Ecologists are taking baby steps towards being able to make predition in ecology
- Easier done when system dynamics are UNDERSTOOD 
- When systems are well-described
- When conditions are predictable
- I think we have a long way until we are able to forecast most undesirable shifts in the environment, whcih some may refer to as regime shifts.

# Applications Exceed Regime Shift Theory and Method Efficacy  <!-- summarise diss findings-->
.medium[

- Too many methods proposed
- Few rigorously tested
- Still no generalizable methods
- Some methods sensitive to data quality/quantity
  - but velocity appears robust
- Divergence of regime shift theory from dynamical systems theory

- Does the method assume __smooth potential__? <sup>1</sup>
- Types of shifts detected
- Sensitivity to:
  - data quality & quantity
  - process lags

- Theory way behind our applications
- No practiioners are using these metrics
- Perhaps because the theory is lagging WAY far behind applications and claims
- Rigorous statistical testing
