- So the question becomes -- can we foresee and perhaps avoid undesirable change in ecological systems?

# Ecological Regime Shifts  <!-- what how goal -->
???
- One way the scientific community is attempting to foresee and avoid undesirable conseuqences (like bashing your face into an ice wall)
- is to develop and apply the concept of __ecological regime shifts__ ... next

## **what?**  a persistent change in the structure or functioning of a system 
</br>  
???
- A **persistent change in the sturcture or functioning of a system**
--

## **how?** loss of negative feedback(s) maintaining the system
<br>
???
- Regime shifts occur, via a number of pathways, when a system **loses the negative feedback(s) maintaining** the system in its current state

- Again, *goal* is to predict in time to prevent something bad from happening. Pipe dream? Probably...
--

## **goal?** predict in time to prevent  
???
- goal is to predict regime shifts in time to either prevent or create a plan of action for timely mitigation

# Regime Shift Example: Coral Reef Bleaching <!-- caryfort before -->

- Regime shifts are especially important when the changes impact human societies and livelihoods.

- Identifying and predicting regime shifts is a feasible feat when the system is well-understood
- For most ecological systems, however, this is not the case...next

# Problem: Ecosystems are Complex <!--prediction is difficult in ecology...-->

.medium[
- high dimensional    
- many ( $\infty$ ) interactions  
- dynamic (time dependence)
- non-linear  
- non-ergodic (open)    
]
???
Ecosystems are 
- high dimensional, especially as we increase scale system extent
- which leads to a higher number of interactions
- increasingly realizing these are non-linear interactions
- non-ergodic
- because they are open, they are obviously dynamic.
--
<font color="blue">.medium[Especially difficult when drivers are unknown in a high dimensional system]</font>
???
- These characteristics, paired with our inability to perfectly observe the systems means that we cannot predict many shifts now,  
- Especially as we move beyonbd just a handful of state  variables.

# <!--Research Question + Diss Aims-->
<font size="15" color="red">Research Question Motivating this Research</font>

- But before we can even talk about predicting regime shifts, we need to to be able to accurately and precisely DETECT historic changes under varying conditions, and especially in complex and messy ecological data.

>pause...water 
- So, with the practical ecologist in mind, or basically anyone not able to spend a solid 4 years studying this literature and testing these methods but wishing to apply these methods, my dissertation focuses on the quantitative methods proposed for identifying ecological regime shfits
- Particularly I focus on the methods that are used for ecological community and systems, rather than single-species or single-state variable analyses.

My dissertation comprises 8 chapters, with three themes

- In chapters 1,2 and 8 I review and synthesize both the state of the regime shift  literature, focusing on the quantiattive methods we are usign to identify regime shifts.

# Regime Detection Methods Difficult to Find Using Typical Literature Reviews <!--results: journals--> 
???
- I conducted a second litearture review in an attempt to build a comprehensive list of the methods proposed and applied for detecting eoclogical regime shifts
- Using a well-defined boolean search AND incorpoating my prior knowledge, <u>I identified over 70 methods </u> proposed or used to ID ecological regime shifts 

--

<img src="figures/wosRegimePubsByJrnl_min4Pubs.png" width="750">
- A few things contributed to my inability to build this list using typical lit search methods:
  1. Jargon is inconsistent
  2. Methods are not often first proposed in either methods journals, nor proposed using theoretical data
    - rather, they are applied using empirical data, and put into more 'applied journals'

- Ecologists are taking baby steps towards being able to make predition in ecology
- Easier done when system dynamics are UNDERSTOOD 
- When systems are well-described
- When conditions are predictable
- I think we have a long way until we are able to forecast most undesirable shifts in the environment, whcih some may refer to as regime shifts.
