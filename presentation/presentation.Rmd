- So the question becomes -- can we foresee and perhaps avoid undesirable change in ecological systems?

# Ecological Regime Shifts  <!-- what how goal -->
???
- One way the scientific community is attempting to foresee and avoid undesirable conseuqences (like bashing your face into an ice wall)
- is to develop and apply the concept of __ecological regime shifts__ ... next

## **what?**  a persistent change in the structure or functioning of a system 
</br>  
???
- A **persistent change in the sturcture or functioning of a system**
--

## **how?** loss of negative feedback(s) maintaining the system
<br>
???
- Regime shifts occur, via a number of pathways, when a system **loses the negative feedback(s) maintaining** the system in its current state

- Again, *goal* is to predict in time to prevent something bad from happening. Pipe dream? Probably...
--

## **goal?** predict in time to prevent  
???
- goal is to predict regime shifts in time to either prevent or create a plan of action for timely mitigation

# Regime Shift Example: Coral Reef Bleaching <!-- caryfort before -->
???
- Regime shifts are especially important when the changes impact human societies and livelihoods.

- For example, coral reef systems provide economic opportunity via ecotourism and fisheries revenue, and also provide storm protection to local human communities.

- However, these ecosystem services are lost when the coral reef undergoes a reigme shift to a bleached state, or upon death of the reef

- Identifying and predicting regime shifts is a feasible feat when the system is well-understood
- For most ecological systems, however, this is not the case...next

# Problem: Ecosystems are Complex <!--prediction is difficult in ecology...-->

.medium[
- high dimensional    
- many ( $\infty$ ) interactions  
- dynamic (time dependence)
- non-linear  
- non-ergodic (open)    
]
???
Ecosystems are 
- high dimensional, especially as we increase scale system extent
- which leads to a higher number of interactions
- increasingly realizing these are non-linear interactions
- non-ergodic
- because they are open, they are obviously dynamic.
--
<font color="blue">.medium[Especially difficult when drivers are unknown in a high dimensional system]</font>
???
- These characteristics, paired with our inability to perfectly observe the systems means that we cannot predict many shifts now,  
- Especially as we move beyonbd just a handful of state  variables.

# <!--Research Question + Diss Aims-->
<font size="15" color="red">Research Question Motivating this Research</font>

- But before we can even talk about predicting regime shifts, we need to to be able to accurately and precisely DETECT historic changes under varying conditions, and especially in complex and messy ecological data. 
- The research question motivating my researhc program is just that.... __click__

???
>pause...water 
- So, with the practical ecologist in mind, or basically anyone not able to spend a solid 4 years studying this literature and testing these methods but wishing to apply these methods, my dissertation focuses on the quantitative methods proposed for identifying ecological regime shfits
- Particularly I focus on the methods that are used for ecological community and systems, rather than single-species or single-state variable analyses.

#  Dissertation Themes & Outline<!--chapter themes-->
???
My dissertation comprises 8 chapters, with three themes
--

.small[<font color="black"><b><u>Theme 1</u>: Synthesize and review methods and literature</b></font>]
.smaller[
- __Chapter 1 & 8__: Introduction to and Synthesis of the State of Regime Detection Measures
- __Chapter 2__: A Brief Overview of the Ecological Regime Detection Methods
]
???
- In chapters 1,2 and 8 I review and synthesize both the state of the regime shift  literature, focusing on the quantiattive methods we are usign to identify regime shifts. 

--

.small[<font color="black"><b> <u>Theme 2</u>: Test the utility and efficacy of methods</b></font>]
.smaller[
- __Chapter 4__: Spatial application of Fisher Information
- __Chapter 5__: Proposed method: velocity (*v*) of  system  trajectory 
- __Chapter 6__: Relative performance of methods using resampling
- __Chapter 7__: Body mass distributions application
]

???
- Next, I use theoretical and empirical data to test the utility and efficacy of selected regime sfhit methods  

--

.small[<font color="black"><b> <u>Theme 3</u>: Improve method accessibility</b></font>]
.smaller[
- __Chapter 3__: Deconstructing Fisher Information calculation

???
Finally I will give a brief overview and very shamelessly promote the open sources softwares associated with this research program and which were used throughout  this research program

- Ecologists are taking baby steps towards being able to make predition in ecology
- Easier done when system dynamics are UNDERSTOOD 
- When systems are well-described
- When conditions are predictable
- I think we have a long way until we are able to forecast most undesirable shifts in the environment, whcih some may refer to as regime shifts.
