# Anthropogenic Activity is Changing the World &lt;!-- anthropo activity == unwanted chgs--&gt;

???
- Modern anthropogenic activity is leading to unprecedented change across the globe  

- For example, our activiies have altered atmospheric conditions __click__

# Humans Influence Regime Shifts, Impacting Ecological &amp; Social Systems &lt;!--humans induce regime shifts--&gt;

- So the question becomes -- can we foresee and perhaps avoid undesirable change in ecological systems?

---
# Ecological Regime Shifts  &lt;!-- what how goal --&gt;
???
- One way the scientific community is attempting to foresee and avoid undesirable conseuqences (like bashing your face into an ice wall)
- is to develop and apply the concept of __ecological regime shifts__ ... next

## **what?**  a persistent change in the structure or functioning of a system 
&lt;/br&gt;  
???
- A **persistent change in the sturcture or functioning of a system**
--

## **how?** loss of negative feedback(s) maintaining the system
&lt;br&gt;
???
- Regime shifts occur, via a number of pathways, when a system **loses the negative feedback(s) maintaining** the system in its current state

- Again, *goal* is to predict in time to prevent something bad from happening. Pipe dream? Probably...
--

## **goal?** predict in time to prevent  
???
- goal is to predict regime shifts in time to either prevent or create a plan of action for timely mitigation

- Regime shifts are especially important when the changes impact human societies and livelihoods.

- However, these ecosystem services are lost when the coral reef undergoes a reigme shift to a bleached state, or upon death of the reef

# Prediction is ~The~ Holy Grail of Ecology &lt;!--holy grail is prediction--&gt;

???
- Ecologists are taking baby steps towards being able to make predition in ecology
- Easier done when system dynamics are UNDERSTOOD 
- When systems are well-described
- When conditions are predictable
- I think we have a long way until we are able to forecast most undesirable shifts in the environment, whcih some may refer to as regime shifts.

# Problem: Ecosystems are Complex &lt;!--prediction is difficult in ecology...--&gt;
.medium[Complicating our ability to identify regime shifts]
--
.medium[
- high dimensional    
- many ( `\(\infty\)` ) interactions  
- dynamic (time dependence)
- non-linear  
- non-ergodic (open)    
]
???
Ecosystems are 
- high dimensional, especially as we increase scale system extent
- which leads to a higher number of interactions
- increasingly realizing these are non-linear interactions
- non-ergodic
- because they are open, they are obviously dynamic.
--
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;.medium[Especially difficult when drivers are unknown in a high dimensional system]&lt;/font&gt;

- These characteristics, paired with our inability to perfectly observe the systems means that 
- Especially as we move beyonbd just a handful of state  variables.

# &lt;!--Research Question + Diss Aims--&gt;
&lt;font size="15" color="red"&gt;Research Question Motivating this Research&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
???
- But before we can even talk about predicting regime shifts, we need to to be able to accurately and precisely DETECT historic changes under varying conditions, and especially in complex and messy ecological data. 
- The research question motivating my researhc program is just that.... __click__

&lt;font size="15" color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;.center[Can we detect &amp; predict ecological regime shifts in &lt;u&gt;under-described&lt;/u&gt; systems?]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

???
&gt;pause 
- So, with the practical ecologist in mind, or basically anyone not able to spend a solid 4 years studying this literature and testing these methods but wishing to apply these methods, my dissertation focuses on the quantitative methods proposed for identifying ecological regime shfits
- Particularly I focus on the methods that are used for ecological community and systems, rather than single-species or single-state variable analyses.

# The Practical Ecologist Has Not the Time To: &lt;!--list all chaps--&gt;
.small[&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthesize regime shift methods available&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]
???
My dissertation comprises 8 chapters, with two goals
--

- __Chapter 1 &amp; 8__: Introduction to and Synthesis of the State of Regime Detection Measures
- __Chapter 2__: A Brief Overview of the Ecological Regime Detection Methods

???
My dissertation comprises a few key components:
  1. Creating a resource for ecologists to visit to view all the available methods
  1. Improving select methods
  1. Testing the boundaries of existing and new methods 

--

.small[&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Test the utility and efficacy of regime detection methods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]

- __Chapter 4__: An application of Fisher Information to bird community data does not reveal distinct regimes in the continental United States
- __Chapter 5__: Velocity (*v*): using rate-of-change of  system  trajectory to identify abrupt changes
- __Chapter 6__: Using Resampling Methods to Evaluate the Relative Performance of Regime Detection Measures Under Varying Conditions of Data Quality and Quantity

Finally I will give a brief overview and very shamelessly promote the open sources softwares associated with this research program and which were used throughout  this research program

# Chapter 2: Methods for Detecting Regime Shifts &lt;!--ch2 background of RS theory --&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;

???
- Ecological regime shift theory was born out of dynamical systems theory, a branch of mathematics
- Of particular note are the existence of chaotic systems, or, systems which are unpredictible in most situations
- The study of chaotic systems in mathematics is relatively new (1980s)

--

- That is, a system which exhibits time-dependence
- The Lorenz, or butterfly attractor, is a commonly used visualization of such a system  
- For example, somepredator-prey systems cna exhibit chaotic behavior reflecting the Lorenz attractor [^1]

and has very much diverged from the field
- When entering a new field of research or usign a new method, the practical ecologist might conduct a lit review
- Research surrounding ecological regime shifts and the methods used to identify them, however, are spread across disciplines, and subdisciplines.
- The same goes for when we are trying to identify best methods and best practices using methods on empirical data
- This, however is a difficult feat in the regime shift literature
