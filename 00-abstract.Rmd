Identifying abrupt changes in the structure and functioning of systems, or system regime shifts, in ecological and social-ecological systems leads to an understanding of relative and absolute system resilience. Resilience is an emergent phenomenon of complex social-ecological systems, and is the ability of a system to absorb disturbance without reorganizing into a new state, or regime. Resilience science provides a framework and methodology for quantitatively assessing the capacity of a system to maintain its current trajectory (or to stay within a certain, and often desirable regime). If and when a systemâ€™s resilience is exceeded, it crosses a threshold and enters into an alternate regime (or undergoes a regime shift).   
I use Fisher Information to detect regime shifts in time and space using avian community data obtained from the North American Breeding Bird Survey within the area east of the Rockies and west of the Mississippi River. Fisher Information is a technique that captures the dynamic of a system, and this metric will be calculated about a suite of bird species abundances aggregated to the route level for all possible time periods. Transmutation (aggregation error) about inclusion or exclusion of certain bird species, functional groups, and guilds will be analyzed. Efforts have been made to develop early warning indicators of regime shifts in ecosystems, however, for most ecosystems there is great uncertainty in predicting the risk of a regime shift, regarding both when and how long it will take to happen and if it can be recognized early enough to be avoided when desired. We will complement the use of Fisher Information with multiple discontinuity analyses about body mass distributions at the route-level to achieve the aim of identifying individual species that best serve as early-warning indicators of regime shifts. For those species found on the edges of body mass aggregations, we test the hypothesis that the background variance in their abundances (on Breeding Bird Survey routes) will increase more than those not observed at the edge of discontinuity aggregations. Identification of early-warning indicators of regime shifts in ecological systems allows management efforts to focus on a single or a small number of species that inform us about ecosystem resilience and trajectory.   
These methods transcend the primary objective of the Breeding Bird Survey (to monitor population trends) and use this expansive dataset in such a way that information about ecosystem order, trajectory, and resilience emerge. Here, we utilize an expansive dataset (the Breeding Bird Survey) to make broad-scale estimations and predictions about ecosystem resilience, regime status and trajectory, and ecosystem sustainability. Identification of regime shifts and early-warning indicator species may afford us the ability to predict system regime shifts in time.
