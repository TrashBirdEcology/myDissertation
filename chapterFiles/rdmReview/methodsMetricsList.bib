	abstract = {Ecological regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning indicators of impending shifts. A critical question, however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or shoreline development (only gradual restoration is possible). The model represents key features of a broad class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers can only be manipulated gradually management action is needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated, often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is also dependent on developing policy processes that enable society to respond more rapidly to information about impending regime shifts.},

The identification of such regime shifts in time series includes both model-fitting and statistical approaches. We introduce two methods that use state- or measurement-space neighborhood statistics to pick out regime shifts. Analysis of simulated and real data sets shows that these methods can be an effective means of identifying regime shifts for single variable as well as multivariable time series. In addition, these methods can be used on systems with non-equilibrium steady states. However, care must be taken in interpreting results as these methods do respond to changes in time series that are not consistent with the regime shift concept.},

The Fisher Information index, as we have derived it, is a measure of system order, and captures the characteristic variation in speed and acceleration along the system's periodic steady-state trajectories. When calculated repeatedly over the system period, this index tracks steady states and transient behavior. We believe that such an index could be useful in detecting system ???flips??? associated with a regime change, i.e. determining when systems are in a transient between one steady state and another.
