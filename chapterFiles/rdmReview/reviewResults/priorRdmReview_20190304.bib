Computer simulation predicted that the intensity ratio of (662) and (331) reflections for La2-xCaxZr2O7 +/- delta increased with the increasing Ca content x. XRD analysis showed that with increasing x until 0.08, the ratio increased as predicted, then leveled off with further increase of x.

	abstract = {Context Frog species are now targets for delivery of high-value managed environmental flows on floodplains. Information on the drivers of frog presence and abundance is required to support adaptive management, including analysis of the roles of flood frequency, flood timing and habitat type. Aims This paper describes frog species richness and abundance responses to flooding and habitat type in the Barmah Forest, part of the largest river red gum forest in the world. Methods Surveys were conducted at 22 sites over 6 years, to determine species presence, relative abundance, and evidence of breeding. Data were then used to examine temporal patterns within and between wet and dry years and spatial relationships with site geomorphology, vegetation form and wetting frequency. Key results Six species were common and widespread, and three were rare. The seasonal timing of peak numbers of calling males differed among species. The seasonal pattern of calling for each species did not differ between wet and dry years; however, significantly lower numbers of frogs were recorded calling in dry years. The number of frogs calling was significantly higher in well vegetated grassy wetlands. Evidence of a positive relationship between wetting frequency and numbers of calling males was found for Limnodynastes fletcheri, Crinia signifera and Limnodynastes dumerilii. The abundance of tadpoles was significantly higher in wet years. Conclusions The seasonal timing of flooding in Barmah Forest will influence the breeding success of individual species with different preferences. Flooding from September to December is required to cover most preferred breeding seasons, but longer durations may be required to maximise recruitment. This, together with regular flooding of well vegetated grassy wetland habitat, will increase the likelihood of species persistence and maximise diversity. Insufficient flooding frequency will result in reduced frog species richness and abundance. Implications Managed flooding is important for frog abundance and species richness. This study emphasises the value of key habitats such as well vegetated grassy wetlands and reinforces the need to make their preservation a priority for management. It has identified knowledge gaps to drive future data collection for improved modelling, including a need for further research on flow-regime change and frog communities.},

	abstract = {Although Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic is a widely used method, some weaknesses exist in investigating abrupt Change Point (CP) problems, e. g. it is time-consuming and invalid sometimes. To detect abrupt change from time series fast, a novel method is proposed based on Haar Wavelet (HW) and KS statistic (HWKS). First, the two Binary Search Trees (BSTs), termed TcA and TcD, are constructed by multi-level HW from a diagnosed time series; the framework of HWKS method is implemented by introducing a modified KS statistic and two search rules based on the two BSTs; and then fast CP detection is implemented by two HWKS-based algorithms. Second, the performance of HWKS is evaluated by simulated time series dataset. The simulations show that HWKS is faster, more sensitive and efficient than KS, HW, and T methods. Last, HWKS is applied to analyze the electrocardiogram (ECG) time series, the experiment results show that the proposed method can find abrupt change from ECG segment with maximal data fluctuation more quickly and efficiently, and it is very helpful to inspect and diagnose the different state of health from a patient's ECG signal.},

	abstract = {An alkali feldspar megacryst from a protomylonite has been studied using laser ablation-ICP-mass spectrometry combined with cathodoluminescence imaging, Raman spectroscopy, and electron probe microanalysis. The aim was to determine the original (magmatic) geochemical pattern of the crystal and the changes introduced by protomylonitization. Digital concentration-distribution models, derivative gradient models, and fractal statistics, e. g., Hurst-exponent values are used in a novel way to reveal subtle changes in the trace-element composition of the feldspar. Formation of the crystal is reflected in a slightly chaotic trace-element (Ba, Sr, and Rb) distribution pattern that is more or less characterized by continuous development from a fairly homogeneous environment. Derivative gradient models demonstrate a microdomain pattern. Fractal statistics show that element behavior was changeable, with Ba and Sr always more persistent (continuing) and Rb always less persistent, with the latter showing a tendency to migrate. The variations in the Hurst exponent are, however, too large to be explained by magmatic differentiation alone. The observed element behavior may be explained by structural changes revealed by Raman spectroscopy and CL. In high-strain domains, T-O-T modes become stronger for Si-O-Al than Al-O-Al linkages. Increasing amounts of Al-O–Al defects are demonstrated by cathodoluminescence. Both may result from small-distance diffusion creep, making the crystal geochemical pattern slightly patchy. In turn, the marginal part of the megacryst has a mosaic of randomly orientated, newly crystallized K-feldspars. The re-growth is confirmed by trace-element distribution patterns and fractal statistics which identify an abrupt change in the transformation environment. The novel set of tools used in this study reveals a complicated history of megacryst formation and transformation that otherwise would be difficult to unravel and decipher.},

	abstract = {Sandy beaches support a wide variety of underappreciated biodiversity that is critical to coastal ecosystems. Prior to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the diversity and function of supratidal beach sediment microbial communities along Gulf of Mexico coastlines were not well understood. As such, it was unclear if microbial community compositional changes would occur following exposure to beached oil, if indigenous communities could biodegrade oil, or how cleanup efforts, such as sand washing and sediment redistribution, would impact microbial ecosystem resiliency. Transects perpendicular to the shoreline were sampled from public beaches on Grand Isle, Louisiana, and Dauphin Island, Alabama, over one year. Prior to oil coming onshore, elevated levels of bacteria associated with fecal contamination were detected (e.g., Enterobacteriales and Campylobacterales). Over time, significant shifts within major phyla were identified (e.g., Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria) and fecal indicator groups were replaced by taxa affiliated with open-ocean and marine systems (e.g., Oceanospirillales, Rhodospirillales, and Rhodobacterales). These new bacterial groups included putative hydrocarbon degraders, similar to those identified near the oil plume offshore. Shifts in the microbial community composition strongly correlated to more poorly sorted sediment and grain size distributional changes. Natural oceanographic processes could not account for the disrupted sediment, especially from the backshore well above the maximum high-tide levels recorded at these sites. Sand washing and tilling occurred on both open beaches from August through at least December 2010, which were mechanisms that could replace fecal indicator groups with open-ocean groups. Consequently, remediation efforts meant to return beaches to pre-spill compositions caused a regime shift that may have added potential ecosystem function, like hydrocarbon degradation, to the sediment. Future research will need to assess the persistence and impact of the newly formed microbial communities to the overall sandy beach ecosystems.},

Using a novel diagnostic technique, the phase speed, vertical tilting, and form stress of equatorial waves in the stratosphere are obtained continuously on a daily basis. The results indicate that, on top of a weak-amplitude annual-cycle signal, all of these wave properties have a pronounced QBO signal with a downward propagation that evolves continuously together with the background QBO. The analysis also highlights the potential role of wave-induced form stress in driving the QBO regime change. Dominant waves in the equatorial stratosphere propagate very slowly relative to the ground at all times, implying that their observed intrinsic phase speed evolution follows the background QBO nearly exactly but with opposite sign, as the established theory predicts. By revealing the continuous evolution of the form stress associated with the vertically tilted waves, the new diagnostic method also demonstrates the dominance of eastward-tilted, eastward-propagating waves contributing to a deceleration of easterly flow at high altitudes, which causes a downward propagation of the easterly flow signal. Similarly, the dominance of westward-tilted, westward-propagating waves acts to reverse westerly flow to easterly flow and causes a downward propagation of westerly flow signal. The results suggest that in addition to the wave-breaking processes, such continuously alternating downward transfer of westerly and easterly angular momentum by westward-tilted, westward-propagating waves and eastward-tilted, eastward-propagating waves contributes to the wave mean flow interaction mechanism for the QBO.},

	abstract = {Most studies have attempted to identify the major environmental factors responsible for elevational variations in species richness. Such studies have been mainly performed in temperate and tropical areas, whereas the mediterranean biome has been substantially neglected. The aim of this paper was to disentangle the effects of available area, mid-domain constraints, and the environmental tolerance of species, on the altitudinal distribution of tenebrionid beetles in a Mediterranean region. A comprehensive faunistic database was used to assess the elevational distribution of tenebrionids in Latium (Central Italy). Variations in species richness, beta diversity and nestedness were analysed in association with variation in species ranges and midpoints. Variation in species richness was contrasted with patterns expected on the basis of the mid domain effect (MDE) and available surface area. After correcting for differences in area availability due to the conical shape of mountains, an unexpected triphasic pattern emerged: (1) at low altitudes, species richness was higher than expected on the basis of the effect of area and the MDE; (2) at around 800 m elevation, there is an abrupt change in species assemblages, and richness values fit those predicted by the MDE; (3) a new dramatic change occurred at 1,700 m, with tenebrionid assemblages composed of a small number of mainly eurytopic species. The integrated approach used in this study demonstrates that neither MDE nor monotonic patterns fully explain the observed diversity patterns. Variations in species ranges indicate that the elevational gradient filters species according to their ecological tolerance.},

	abstract = {The Asian monsoon system is an important tipping element in Earth's climate with a large impact on human societies in the past and present. In light of the potentially severe impacts of present and future anthropogenic climate change on Asian hydrology, it is vital to understand the forcing mechanisms of past climatic regime shifts in the Asian monsoon domain. Here we use novel recurrence network analysis techniques for detecting episodes with pronounced non-linear changes in Holocene Asian monsoon dynamics recorded in speleothems from caves distributed throughout the major branches of the Asian monsoon system. A newly developed multi-proxy methodology explicitly considers dating uncertainties with the COPRA (COnstructing Proxy Records from Age models) approach and allows for detection of continental-scale regime shifts in the complexity of monsoon dynamics. Several epochs are characterised by non-linear regime shifts in Asian monsoon variability, including the periods around 8.5-7.9, 5.7-5.0, 4.1-3.7, and 3.0-2.4 ka BP. The timing of these regime shifts is consistent with known episodes of Holocene rapid climate change (RCC) and high-latitude Bond events. Additionally, we observe a previously rarely reported non-linear regime shift around 7.3 ka BP, a timing that matches the typical 1.0-1.5 ky return intervals of Bond events. A detailed review of previously suggested links between Holocene climatic changes in the Asian monsoon domain and the archaeological record indicates that, in addition to previously considered longer-term changes in mean monsoon intensity and other climatic parameters, regime shifts in monsoon complexity might have played an important role as drivers of migration, pronounced cultural changes, and the collapse of ancient human societies.},

In addition, we propose a new metrics called evolution strength to measure the error probably caused by incrementally assigning the community ownership or the abrupt change of network structure. The experiment results show that our proposed algorithm is able to identify the community structure in a network with a higher efficiency. Meanwhile, due to the lack of dynamic network data with ground-truth structure and limitation of existing synthetic methods, we propose a novel method for generating synthetic data of dynamic network with ground-truth structure, which defines evolution events and evolution rate of events, so as to get more realistic synthetic data.},

After the whole one-pixel boundary of overlapping fruits was extracted, the curvature at every point on the boundary was calculated. Then the whole boundary was split into segments by removing points with abrupt change in curvature and valid segments were retained through a screening process based on three criterion. At last, the identification of fruits was achieved by circle fitting and merging. Ultimately, the experimental results show that the proposed method is effective.},

Typical core-annulus flow structure and non-uniform distribution of solid holdup appear in the riser. The inside and outside swirling flows of gas motion as well as the fishtailing phenomenon are captured in the cyclone. The solid residence time in the riser shows an early-occurred peak with a long tail. In the riser, details related to solid motion at the particle-scale level are obtained.

	abstract = {Extreme climatic events can trigger abrupt and often lasting change in ecosystems via the reduction or elimination of foundation (i.e., habitat-forming) species. However, while the frequency/intensity of extreme events is predicted to increase under climate change, the impact of these events on many foundation species and the ecosystems they support remains poorly understood. Here, we use the iconic seagrass meadows of Shark Bay, Western Australia - a relatively pristine subtropical embayment whose dominant, canopy-forming seagrass, Amphibolis antarctica, is a temperate species growing near its low-latitude range limit - as a model system to investigate the impacts of extreme temperatures on ecosystems supported by thermally sensitive foundation species in a changing climate. Following an unprecedented marine heat wave in late summer 2010/11, A. antarctica experienced catastrophic ({\textgreater}90\%) dieback in several regions of Shark Bay. Animal-borne video footage taken from the perspective of resident, seagrass-associated megafauna (sea turtles) revealed severe habitat degradation after the event compared with a decade earlier. This reduction in habitat quality corresponded with a decline in the health status of largely herbivorous green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in the 2years following the heat wave, providing evidence of long-term, community-level impacts of the event. Based on these findings, and similar examples from diverse ecosystems, we argue that a generalized framework for assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems to abrupt change associated with the loss of foundation species is needed to accurately predict ecosystem trajectories in a changing climate. This includes seagrass meadows, which have received relatively little attention in this context. Novel research and monitoring methods, such as the analysis of habitat and environmental data from animal-borne video and data-logging systems, can make an important contribution to this framework.},

	abstract = {Critical commentators of agricultural/rural change in advanced economies have begun to refer to `neoproductivist' pathways of change. However, conceptualizations of neo-productivism have so far largely failed to provide a robust analytical framework for understanding the propelling forces, processes and characteristics of complex modern agricultural pathways. This article analyses two key approaches used to conceptualize neo-productivism: an actor-oriented spatio-temporal perspective (the AOST approach) which focuses mainly on geographical and temporal-historical characteristics in the adoption of neoproductivist actor spaces, and structuralist interpretations which see neo-productivism predominantly as a response to macro-political regime change. There is an underlying assumption in both that productivist and non-productivist pathways of agricultural change can be identified in different guises and that the notion of neo-productivism can be situated in relation to productivist/non-productivist concepts. However, they differ in their temporal conceptualisations of agricultural change (i.e. neoproductivism as productivist resurgence versus productivist approaches adapted to match the new political realities of an era influenced by non-productivism), processes (i.e. non-productivist pathways forced by events `back' towards productivist-dominated pathways versus neo-productivism as a shift from a state-led system of support responsible for driving state productivism, to market-based drivers enabled by the gradual withdrawal of the state), and spatial differentiation (i.e. complex geography of actor spaces in the adoption of neo-productivist pathways versus locked-in productivist pathways working alongside multifunctional agriculture). The article concludes with some critical thoughts about the utility of the term `neo-productivism', but also argues that the term allows researchers to further nuance conceptualisations of the complex spatial, temporal and structural changes that characterise modern agriculture in any area of the globe.

Two payments for watershed services (PWS) programs for water quality improvement have been successively implemented in the Huai River catchment and its sub-watershed, the Shaying River catchment, in Henan Province since 2009. To detect changes in water quality in response to PWS schemes, nonparametric statistical approaches were used to analyze gradual and abrupt trends in water quality, focusing on chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) at 26 monitoring stations in the Huai River watershed during 2006-2013. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test and the Theil-Sen estimator were used to identify trends and their magnitudes in weekly water quality observations and the Pettitt test was applied to change-point analysis of water quality time series. We found decreasing concentration trends in the weekly water quality data set in this catchment, with water quality at most stations affected by the PWS schemes. The COD and NH3-N concentrations decreased at 26 stations by an average of 0.05 mg/L wk and 0.01 mg/L wk, respectively, from 2006 to 2013. Meanwhile, the mean concentrations of COD and NH3-N decreased at the 26 stations by an average of 1803 mg/L and 4.82 mg/L, respectively, after the abrupt change points of the time-series trends of these two pollutants. We also estimated annual reductions in COD and NH3-N for each station based on average flow observations using the Theil-Sen approach along with the resulting economic benefits from 2009 to 2010. The COD and NH3-N reductions were 14604.50 and 6213.25 t/y, respectively, in the Huai River catchment in Henan Province. The total economic benefits of reductions in these two pollutants were 769.71 million (sic) 2009 and 2010, accounting for 0.08\% and 0.06\%, respectively, of the GDP in the entire Huai River watershed of Henan Province. These results provide new insights into the linkages between PWS programs and water quality improvements at regional and local scales for effective management of water resources.

	abstract = {Spectro-Temporal Receptive Fields (STRFs) were estimated from both multi-unit sorted clusters and high-gamma power responses in human auditory cortex. Intracranial electrophysiological recordings were used to measure responses to a random chord sequence of Gammatone stimuli. Traditional methods for estimating STRFs from single-unit recordings, such as spike-triggered-averages, tend to be noisy and are less robust to other response signals such as local field potentials. We present an extension to recently advanced methods for estimating STRFs from generalized linear models (GLM). A new variant of regression using regularization that penalizes non-zero coefficients is described, which results in a sparse solution. The frequency-time structure of the STRF tends toward grouping in different areas of frequency-time and we demonstrate that group sparsity-inducing penalties applied to GLM estimates of STRFs reduces the background noise while preserving the complex internal structure. The contribution of local spiking activity to the high-gamma power signal was factored out of the STRF using the GLM method, and this contribution was significant in 85 percent of the cases. Although the GLM methods have been used to estimate STRFs in animals, this study examines the detailed structure directly from auditory cortex in the awake human brain. We used this approach to identify an abrupt change in the best frequency of estimated STRFs along posteromedial-to-anterolateral recording locations along the long axis of Heschl's gyrus. This change correlates well with a proposed transition from core to non-core auditory fields previously identified using the temporal response properties of Heschl's gyrus recordings elicited by click-train stimuli.},

The original MTTE technique is effective with regard to the antislip control; however, it cannot sufficiently utilize the adhesive force from the tire-road surface. In the proposed TCS algorithm, only front wheels are equipped with the MTTE technique, while rear wheels are equipped with the SMC technique. As a result, the front wheel is critically controlled by the MTTE technique. Thus, its rotary speed can be used to approximately estimate the chassis velocity and acceleration, which are key input parameters of the SMC. The rear wheel slip ratio can be therefore controlled by the SMC which is robust against uncertainties and disturbances of parameters for exploiting more transmissible friction force. In addition, the stability of MTTE is analyzed in this paper because an important parameter is neglected in the original MTTE technique. As a result, the stability condition is changed, and the MTTE is modified in the proposed TCS according to the new conclusion. A half four-wheel drive (4WD) EV model is initially built using MATLAB/SIMULINK. This paper investigates the proposed TCS for various adhesive conditions involving abrupt change in road friction. Compared with the original MTTE technique, the comprehensive performance, particularly the acceleration ability, is significantly improved by the proposed controller. The simulation result validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed TCS.},

Despite a basin-wide cooling trend, we report an anomalous warming in the central subpolar basin during the LIA that is reproduced in ensemble simulations with the climate model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-3 as a result of a non-linear regime shift in the subpolar North Atlantic ocean circulation. The identified volcanically triggered non-linear transition in the model simulations provides a plausible explanation for the signatures of time-irreversibility found in the ocean sediment records.

The climate regime shift is one of the most common forms of abrupt climate change, which mainly refers to the statistical significant changes on the variable of climate system at one time scale. These detection methods can be roughly divided into five categories based on different types of abrupt changes, namely, abrupt mean value change, abrupt variance change, abrupt frequency change, abrupt probability density change, and the multivariable analysis. The main research progress of abrupt climate change detection methods is reviewed. What is more, some actual applications of those methods in observational data are provided. With the development of nonlinear science, many new methods have been presented for detecting an abrupt dynamic change in recent years, which is useful supplement for the abrupt change detection methods.},

	abstract = {Precipitation directly impacts agricultural production, water resources management, and recreational activities, all of which significantly affect a state's economy. As the human population increases, demand for water escalates due to its crucial role in human health and food production. The question then becomes, can current water management strategies ensure sustainable access to clean water, maintain food supplies, and permit industrial uses given a changing climate? Developing a solid understanding of rainfall patterns and trends is vital, particularly for regions like Kansas with high spatial and temporal climate variability. In this study, three statistical methods were used to analyse annual rainfall trends in Kansas using daily rainfall data from 1890 through 2011: (1) a linear regression model, (2) the Mann-Kendall test, and (3) the Spearman test. A gradual increase in total annual rainfall was noted for 21 of 23 stations, including eight statistically significant upward trends. The 23 station period of record average slope for Kansas was 6.8 mm per 10 year with a minimum value of -8.5 mm per 10 year for Saint Francis in the northwest and a maximum value of 20.1 mm per 10 year for Independence in the southeast. In addition, sudden change analyses were conducted using cumulative sum and Pettitt tests. At 12 stations, significant change-points were detected as early as 1940 and as recently as 1980. The increasing trend, particularly after the significant change-points, is useful in updating water management plans. Total annual rainfall correlates with available water in soil, lakes, streams, and reservoirs and can assist with agricultural production decisions such as crop selection and new plant variety development when combined with rainfall distribution analysis throughout the year.},

The alignment of electronic energy levels at a heterojunction can be used to tailor charge transfer across the interface, for example to improve carrier injection or to block leakage current. An overview of the understanding of heterojunction energy-level alignment with specific examples of the unique contributions that hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) provides to the understanding of this topic is presented in this chapter. Many theoretical approaches have been applied to heterojunction band alignment, and have had some success in predicting band-alignment values in some but not all cases. Band-alignment measurements have been made using electronic measurements such as internal photoemission, as well as photoelectron spectroscopy either measuring valence bands directly or through the use of core levels. Examples of measurements made by these techniques is presented. HAXPES measurements provide a greater analysis depth, which provides the advantage of measuring “real” heterojunctions fabricated by industrially-relevant techniques. HAXPES has been used to query the fundamental limitations on interlayer thickness for band-offset engineering, and the use of new materials for photovoltaic applications. These and other applications are presented.},

	abstract = {Around the world, the decreasing health of coral reef ecosystems has highlighted the need to better understand the processes of reef degradation. The development of more sensitive tools, which complement traditional methods of monitoring coral reefs, may reveal earlier signs of degradation and provide an opportunity for pre-emptive responses. We identify new, sensitive metrics of ecosystem processes and benthic composition that allow us to quantify subtle, yet destabilizing, changes in the ecosystem state of an inshore coral reef on the Great Barrier Reef. Following severe climatic disturbances over the period 2011-2012, the herbivorous reef fish community of the reef did not change in terms of biomass or functional groups present. However, fish-based ecosystem processes showed marked changes, with grazing by herbivorous fishes declining by over 90\%. On the benthos, algal turf lengths in the epilithic algal matrix increased more than 50\% while benthic sediment loads increased 37-fold. The profound changes in processes, despite no visible change in ecosystem state, i.e., no shift to macroalgal dominance, suggest that although the reef has not undergone a visible regime-shift, the ecosystem is highly unstable, and may sit on an ecological knife-edge. Sensitive, process-based metrics of ecosystem state, such as grazing or browsing rates thus appear to be effective in detecting subtle signs of degradation and may be critical in identifying ecosystems at risk for the future.},

Utilizing the geometric features of sharp corners, a novel and general CMM method is proposed in this paper. The major advantage of this approach over the conventional CMM is that a corner with only one sensed edge can be identified through comparing the scan data between two subsequent sensed points in the same scan, as a sharp corner with only one edge sensed will cause two adjacent scan data an abrupt change. In order to identify the same corner point in two adjacent scans, an effective corner matching algorithm is formulated based on the distance matrix constructed from the corner points identified in each scan. Finally, with two or more matched corner points between two adjacent scans, the change of the robot pose (position and orientation) can be accurately estimated. As the proposed approach only deals with the point data, it is computationally efficient. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through experiments.},

	abstract = {Since the regime change almost a quarter of century has passed. The revelative period of the first decade was the time of looking for paths also in architecture, when several buildings were realized that could be classified to internationally known trends too. In the first half of the 2000s beside the survival of the previous trend of pluralism - regionalism has become an increasingly determinant principle of mainstream architecture as well as a comprehensive theoretical concept, mostly under the protective shield of Kenneth Frampton's term `critical regionalism'. In the last decade and the recent years, the style categories that were apparently valid before have been questioned by the present situation generated by the economic crisis. We cannot talk about a new era and there are no clear stylistic formulas and tendencies either. The recent strategies sometimes still reflect regionalism but more often they are moving away from it. One of these trends is the strategy of the `house-like' concepts of pitched roofs can be traced even today but the bonding to location and local conditions turns up on new levels and manifests in new creative methods. Hungarian building regulations often restrict the resulting buildings in their forms too; and only a few innovative examples can be realized from this over-definition. However, there are some new buildings which try to reinterpret the archetypal house form, only their answers do not present romantic or pathetic resources and resolutions anymore much rather pragmatic ones, however, even through these examples a strong local presence shines in a paradox way. The different origins of the attempts in this field can easily be identified. Some architects make the archetypal house form more abstract and object-like with the abstract definition of forms and the use of homogenous materials on walls and roof or the formula created with addition of forms can also prove itself to be a productive way, when the architect uses the archetypal form once as a being-like element and at the same time as an experience that can be interpreted as a street view transcription, a certain kind of structure. In my lecture, I would like to present the results of this kind of architectural thinking and method, with focusing on the newest examples (like Balazs Marian's and Peter Gereben's small winery complex in Eger, which project won the main award of the Piran Architectural Days in 2014). The results are based on a research which was supported by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in the last years.},

	abstract = {Background. This study sought to evaluate the predictors of malignancy in the 2012 international consensus guidelines for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and validate their diagnostic value relative to the 2006 guidelines. Methods. Between 2002 and 2014, 177 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection of IPMN were reviewed. Based on the 2012 guidelines, high-risk stigmata (mural nodule with enhancement, main pancreatic duct [MPD] {\textgreater}= 10 mm, and obstructive jaundice) and worrisome features (cyst size 30 mm, thickened cyst wall, mural nodule without enhancement, MPD 5-9 mm, an abrupt change in MPD diameter, and lymphadenopathy) were assessed, and predictive and diagnostic values were analyzed statistically. Results. Multivariate analysis identified obstructive jaundice (odds ratio [OR], 23.9; P {\textless} .0001), abrupt change in MPD diameter (OR; 3.01; P = .017) and lymphadenopathy (OR, 5.84; P = .027) as independent predictive factors, with an accuracy of 69.8, 67.4, and 66.3\%, respectively. Operative intervention was indicated in 156 patients (94.0\%) using the 2006 guidelines, and in 130 (78.3 \%) using the 2012 guidelines. The accuracy of the 2006 guidelines was 35.5 \% compared with 44.8 \% for the 2012 guidelines. The area under the curve (AUC) for the 2006 and 2012 guidelines was 0.65 and 0.67, respectively; Delta AUC was 0.02, which was not statistically significant. When the worrisome features were combined with high-risk stigmata, the AUC increased to 0.79. Conclusion. Obstructive jaundice, abrupt change in MPD diameter, and lymphadenopathy were independent predictive factors in the 2012 guidelines with high accuracy. Using the new guidelines, the number of patients with IPMN managed with observation and the predictive accuracy increased.},

	abstract = {The behavior of Spanish inflation rates at the provincial level (consumption prices) differs over the two spans of time considered in our study (1955.1-1978.6, 1978.7-2014.4). We point to a long list of institutional and economic changes, at national and international levels, as the potential factors that might have led to this new pattern. In addition to confirming the remarkable persistence shown by the Spanish inflation, the PANIC (panel analysis of non-stationarity in idiosyncratic and common components) analysis we undertake identifies a higher importance of the common component of the series in the second period studied. Besides inflation, we draw attention to a battery of economic and labor variables, mostly through regional data, and we conclude that they tend to converge as well, particularly in the case of our second period of analysis. There are several theoretical avenues whereby the geographic convergence of these variables and the observed inflation convergence could be related. We also relate the common factor in inflation obtained to some potential explanatory variables. Moreover, a relevant additional analysis, which is only feasible for the second period, is implemented by focusing on the weightings attributed to the different groups of goods and services that make up the Consumer Price Index. The outcome we obtain is straightforward: the shopping basket across Spanish provinces has tended to become more homogeneous. In summary, a variety of changes, which we regard as having increased essentially since the late 70s, with the intensification of the Spanish integration in the core of European Union, among other factors, have brought about a regime shift in inflation behavior. The Spanish experience may offer lessons for other economies that follow similar paths, for instance Latin American countries.},

	abstract = {After many years at the forefront of renewable energy (RE) implementation both in Europe and worldwide, Spain experienced a sudden transformation in 2012 to its RE development model in which national government backing and financial incentives for renewables were removed, throwing the RE sector into a paralysis which continues to the present day. This is in marked contrast to the case of the other major European RE leader, Germany, where it has been argued that RE implementation has produced a “regime shift” that has transformed the energy generation model to a new resilient pathway. In this paper, key differences between Spanish regions are identified in the way the RE implementation process has been carried out. The research brings these different characteristics into focus and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the RE implementation process in each region. If stakeholders at all levels are empowered and motivated towards the implementation process goal, it is less likely that a few, very powerful actors (e.g. multinational energy companies or governments) can dominate the process, and thus systemic instability can be reduced. In this way, lock-down situations like the current one can be avoided in future and a more resilient system can be designed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Identifying critical shifts in ecosystems caused by human impacts has become a priority for understanding resilience to change and setting realistic landscape management goals. Previous work suggests that many British blanket peats have suffered a loss of functional integrity over recent centuries, but it is unclear whether all moorland habitats are equally vulnerable. This study examines the relative sensitivity of four contrasting moorland communities to historic land-use changes and assesses whether these management pressures are pushing some moorlands beyond their Holocene range of variability. Late Holocene dynamics in the Peak District, northern England, were investigated using high resolution pollen, fungal spore and charcoal data, and multivariate analyses. All sites show high Calluna values during the 19th century and converge on local Poaceae dominance during the 20th century. This involved a shift from gradual or cyclical variability and moderate changes in pollen abundance during preceding centuries, to rapid transitions between mono-dominant pollen assemblages and a functional shift to taxa with competitive traits; these are interpreted as a regime shift. Evidence for the recent recovery of dwarf shrubs and Sphagnum is strong at one site, with slight evidence from two others, but disturbance could push the system back to grass dominance. The deep blanket peat site may have crossed a threshold, leading to a persistent grass dominated state. Studying regime shifts on decadal to centennial scales can help bridge the gap between ecology and palaeoecology by providing a robust basis for assessing vulnerability, setting restoration priorities and managing novel peatland states.},

	abstract = {The present-day Lesina area (Adriatic coast of southern Italy) preserves in the subsurface the stratigraphic signature of a recent sedimentary process regime change, which was responsible for the conversion of a former alluvial plain into a back-barrier tidal flat and, finally, into the modern barrier island. Facies-based analyses of the first 55 m of the upper Pleistocene-Holocene stratigraphic record, integrated with biostratigraphic sampling, radiocarbon data, and aerial observations of some diagnostic relict morphologies, allowed us to reconstruct the history of the last 20,000 years of this area. The succession investigated is adjacent to a salt dome, which uplifted in recent times, forming the easternmost boundary of the present-day Lesina lagoon. Three main stratigraphic intervals were detected in the subsurface: the lowermost unit is made up of conglomerates, sandstones, and mudstones of terrestrial origin, belonging to a complex system of alluvial plain filling a pre-existing Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) topography. The second interval consists of sands and muds, with subordinate conglomerates of brackish and marine origin, and lies on the previous one through a wide ravinement. Its composing lithofacies exhibit a strong tidal signature preserved in tidal rhythmites belonging to a net of tidal channels, associated with marshes, mud flat, and lagoonal deposits. These sediments record the emplacement of a back-barrier tidal flat, which developed under the strong influence of a tidal influx enhanced by the late post-LGM transgression. The third uppermost interval resulted from the deposition of coastal-marine sands and gravels accumulated during the ensuing modern normal regression, under the dominance of a wave-dominated coastal dynamics, which was responsible for the progradation of the present-day beach barrier and the closure of the Lesina lagoon. The paleogeography of the back-barrier tidal flat preceding the onset of the modern barrier island is thus reconstructed based on the results of our facies analysis, biostratigraphy, and AMS dating. Many of the elements composing this mid-Holocene tide-influenced system were also interpreted from the aerial-photograph observation of several relict morphologies, which are still preserved in many parts of the modern Lesina barrier island. We propose some new interpretation on the origin some of these elements, which possibly developed under sedimentary process regimes different from the modern ones, including some flood-tidal deltas, previously interpreted as tsunami-derived washover fans.},

Early detection of such surface damage is crucial in order to avoid sudden failure and the subsequent downtime losses and safety hazards. In this paper we develop methods for inner damage identification in pipes utilizing the vibration mode shapes. Wall-thinning and cracks are modeled by smooth gradual change and abrupt change in the internal surface of the pipe, respectively. Since wavelets are very efficient in detecting fast changes in signals and their derivatives, they are primarily used to detect crack development. While wavelets cannot be used to detect smooth wall-thinning changes, they can, nevertheless, be used to detect the beginning and end of such damage. We develop a new method for identifying the profile of the inner surface of the pipe, once the wavelet transform indicates that damage is taking place. The identification process requires the shape of one vibration mode of the pipe and does not require the elaborate monitoring and tracking of changes in the modal characteristics. No baseline data are needed aside from the nominal values of the pipe parameters. In addition to damage localization, the developed identification method is capable of quantizing damage severity from the identification of a more accurate profile of the inner surface of the pipe. The motivation and methods used in this work are introduced first in a general setting and then demonstrated by several pipe examples. The numerical simulations carried out here indicate the effectiveness of the developed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

There is heated debate over drivers, especially when trying to understand the causes of major ecosystem events termed regime shifts. In this work, we have researched and developed a novel methodology based on Genetic Programming (GP) for distinguishing which drivers can influence species abundance. This methodology benefits of having no a priori assumptions either on the ecological parameters used or on the underlying mathematical relationships among them. We have validated this methodology applying it to the North Sea pelagic ecosystem. We use the target species Calanus finmarchicus, a key copepod in temperate and subarctic ecosystems, along with 86 biological, hydrographical and climatic time series, ranging from local water nutrients and fish predation, to large scale climate pressure patterns. The chosen study area is the central North Sea, from 1972 to 2011, during which period there was an ecological regime shift. The GP based analysis identified 3 likely drivers of C. finmarchicus abundance, which highlights the importance of considering both physical and trophic drivers: temperature, North Sea circulation (net flow into the North Atlantic), and predation (herring). No large scale climate patterns were selected, suggesting that when there is availability of both data types, local drivers are more important. The results produced by the GP based procedure are consistent with the literature published to date, and validate the use of GP for interpreting species dynamics. We propose that this methodology holds promises for the highly non-linear field of ecology.},

This new preparation method yields the smallest Cu-Fe-S nanocrystals ever reported to date (1.5 nm for the high bornite structure and 2.7 nm for the chalcopyrite structure). A comparative study of nanocrystals of the same composition (Cu1.6Fe1.0S2.0) but different in size (2.7 nm and 9.3 nm) revealed a pronounced quantum confinement effect, confirmed by three different techniques: UV-vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and Mossbauer spectroscopy. The optical band gap increased from 0.60 eV in the bulk material to 0.69 eV in the nanocrystals of 9.3 nm size and to 1.39 eV in nanocrystals of 2.7 nm size. The same trend was observed in the electrochemical band gaps, derived from cyclic voltammetry studies (band gaps of 0.74 eV and 1.54 eV). The quantum effect was also manifested in Mossbauer spectroscopy by an abrupt change in the spectrum from a quadrupole doublet to a Zeeman sextet below 10 K, which could be interpreted in terms of the well defined energy states in these nanoparticles, resulting from quantum confinement. The Mossbauer spectroscopic data confirmed, in addition to the results of XPS spectroscopy, the co-existence of Fe(III) and Fe(II) in the synthesized nanocrystals. The organic shell composition was investigated by NMR (after dissolution of the inorganic core) and IR spectroscopy. Both methods identified oleylamine (OLA) and 1-octadecene (ODE) as surfacial ligands, the latter being formed in situ via an elimination-hydrogenation reaction occurring between OLA and the nanocrystal surface.},

	abstract = {Natural hydrological regimes are essential to the stability of river basins. While numerous efforts have been put forth to characterize flow regime alterations driven by climate change and human activities, few approaches have been proposed to explore changes in watershed resilience. The present study attempted to introduce a systematic approach that can be used to identify the resilience change of river basins based on annual river discharge through the application of a convex model and the principle of critical slowing down. Specifically, a resilience indicator (p(1)) that reflects streamfiow autocorrelation at a given time was proposed to represent the temporal variation of the system resilience, and annual water discharge at representative hydrological stations located in upstream, midstream, and downstream regions of a river basin was used to reflect alterations in long-term hydrological processes and the stability of river basins. The application of this method to the Yellow River basin and Yangtze River basin indicated that the system resilience was lower in downstream regions compared to upstream regions. The Yellow River basin has suffered a decrease in resilience in its lower reaches since 1971, which extended to the middle reaches in 1987 and upper reaches in 1990. Similarly, recent observation of the resilience change in the Yangtze River basin indicated that resilience in its lower reaches has likely decreased since 2002, and this low resilience extended to the middle reaches in 2005. Overall, our study presents a new method to predict potential decreases of resilience in complex large scale watershed systems where mechanistic insight is insufficient to build reliable basin-scale hydrological, climate, ecosystem integrated models.

	abstract = {The paper presents a new method for diagnosis of a process fault which takes the form of an abrupt change in some real parameter of a time-continuous linear system. The abrupt fault in the process real parameter is reflected in step changes in many parameters of the input/output model as well as in step changes in canonical state variables of the system. Detection of these state changes will enable localization of the faulty parameter in the system. For detecting state changes, a special type of exact state observer will be used. The canonical state will be represented by the derivatives of the measured output signal. Hence the exact state observer will play the role of virtual sensors for reconstruction of the derivatives of the output signal. For designing the exact state observer, the model parameters before and after the moment of fault occurrence must be known. To this end, a special identification method with modulating functions will be used. A novel concept presented in this paper concerns the structure of the observer. It will take the form of a double moving window observer which consists of two signal processing windows, each of width T. These windows are coupled to each other with a common edge. The right-hand side edge of the left-side moving window in the interval [t - 2T, t - T] is connected to the left-hand side edge of the right-side window which operates in the interval [t - T, t]. The double observer uses different measurements of input/output signals in both the windows, and for each current time t simultaneously reconstructs two values of the state-the final value of the state in the left-side window zT (t - T) and the initial value of the state z(0)(t - T) in the right-side window. If the process parameters are constant, the values of both the states on the common joint edge are the same. If an abrupt change (fault) in some parameter at the moment t(A) = t - T occurs in the system, then step changes in some variables of the canonical state vector will also occur and the difference between the states will be detected. This will enable localization of the faulty parameter in the system.},

	abstract = {Polar bear (Ursus maritimus) subpopulations in several areas with seasonal sea ice regimes have shown declines in body condition, reproductive rates, or abundance as a result of declining sea ice habitat. In the Foxe Basin region of Nunavut, Canada, the size of the polar bear subpopulation has remained largely stable over the past 20 years, despite concurrent declines in sea ice habitat. We used fatty acid analysis to examine polar bear feeding habits in Foxe Basin and thus potentially identify ecological factors contributing to population stability. Adipose tissue samples were collected from 103 polar bears harvested during 2010-2012. Polar bear diet composition varied spatially within the region with ringed seal (Pusa hispida) comprising the primary prey in northern and southern Foxe Basin, whereas polar bears in Hudson Strait consumed equal proportions of ringed seal and harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus). Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) consumption was highest in northern Foxe Basin, a trend driven by the ability of adult male bears to capture large-bodied prey. Importantly, bow-head whale (Balaena mysticetus) contributed to polar bear diets in all areas and all age and sex classes. Bowhead carcasses resulting from killer whale (Orcinus orca) predation and subsistence harvest potentially provide an important supplementary food source for polar bears during the ice-free period. Our results suggest that the increasing abundance of killer whales and bowhead whales in the region could be indirectly contributing to improved polar bear foraging success despite declining sea ice habitat. However, this indirect interaction between top predators may be temporary if continued sea ice declines eventually severely limit on-ice feeding opportunities for polar bears.},

The method is based on a nonlinear least squares estimation that yields predictions of when the bubble will change regime. Previous studies have only presented results where the predictions turn out to be successful. This study is the first to highlight both the potential and the limitations of the LPPL-model. We find evidence that supports the characteristic patterns as proposed by the LPPL-framework leading up to the change in regime; asset prices during bubble periods seem to oscillate around a faster-than-exponential growth. In most cases the estimation yields accurate predictions, although we conclude that the predictions are quite dependent on the point in time at which they are conducted. We also find that the end of a speculative bubble seems to be influenced by both endogenous speculative growth and exogenous factors. For this reason we propose a new way of interpreting the predictions of the model, where the end dates should be interpreted as the start of a time period where the asset prices are especially sensitive to exogenous events. We propose that negative news during this time period results in a regime shift and the bursting of the bubble. Thus, the model has the ability to predict sensitivity to exogenous events},

	abstract = {Background: Dread Pirate Roberts, founder of the first cryptomarket for illicit drugs named Silk Road, articulated libertarian political motives for his ventures. Previous research argues that there is a significant political component present or involved in cryptomarket drug dealing which is specifically libertarian. The aim of the paper is to investigate the prevalence of political discourses within discussions of cryptomarket drug dealing, and further to research the potential changes of these over the timespan of the study. Methods: We develop a novel operationalization of discourse analytic concepts which we combine with topic modelling enabling us to study how politics are articulated on cryptomarket forums. We apply the Structural Topic Model on a corpus extracted from crawls of cryptomarket forums encompassing posts dating from 2011 to 2015. Results: The topics discussed on cryptomarket forums are primarily centered around the distribution of drugs including discussions of shipping and receiving, product advertisements, and reviews as well as aspects of drug consumption such as testing and consumption. However, on forums whose primary function is aiding operations on a black market, we still observe political matter. We identified one topic which expresses a libertarian discourse that emphasizes the individual's right to non-interference. Over time we observe an increasing prevalence of the libertarian discourse from 2011 to the end of 2013. In the end of 2013 - when Silk Road was seized - we observe an abrupt change in the prevalence of the libertarian discourse. Conclusions: The libertarian political discourse has historically been prevalent on cryptomarket forums. The closure of Silk Road has affected the prevalence of libertarian discourse suggesting that while the closure did not succeed in curtailing the cryptomarket economy, it dampened political sentiments.

	abstract = {Remote sensing has proven a useful way of evaluating long-term trends in vegetation “greenness” through the use of vegetation indices like Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). In particular, analyses of greenness trends have been performed for large areas (continents, for example) in an attempt to understand vegetation response to climate. These studies have been most often used coarse resolution sensors like Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). However, trends in greenness are also important at more local scales, particularly in and around cities as vegetation offers a variety of valuable ecosystem services ranging from minimizing air pollution to mitigating urban heat island effects. To explore the ability to monitor greenness trends in and around cities, this paper presents a new way for analyzing greenness trends based on all available Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images and applies it to Guangzhou, China. This method is capable of including the effects of land cover change in the evaluation of greenness trends by separating the effects of abrupt and gradual changes, and providing information on the timing of greenness trends. An assessment of the consistency of surface reflectance from Landsat 8 with past Landsat sensors indicates biases in the visible bands of Landsat 8, especially the blue band. Landsat 8 NDVI values were found to have a larger bias than the EVI values; therefore, EVI was used in the analysis of greenness trends for Guangzhou. In spite of massive amounts of development in Guangzhou from 2000 to 2014, greenness was found to increase, mostly as a result of gradual change. Comparison of the greening magnitudes estimated from the approach presented here and a Simple Linear Trend (SLT) method indicated large differences for certain time intervals as the SLT method does not include consideration for abrupt land cover changes. Overall, this analysis demonstrates the importance of considering land cover change when analyzing trends in greenness from satellite time series in areas where land cover change is common.

	abstract = {The human population is projected to grow to more than 9 billion by 2050. New farming and fishing techniques are continually being developed. However, food production remains restricted by the finiteness of natural resources and the rapid increase in the global population. In the future, food production may decline because of the aggravated effects of climate change. Food production will be unable to satisfy the demands of the global population, leading to a food security crisis. As the world population continues to increase, food shortages will become increasingly severe, particularly for regions located in “climate impact hot spots” in tropical and subtropical zones and for small-island countries such as Taiwan. In the present study, supply and demand are analysed to examine the risks and uncertainties associated with the impact of climate change on the domestic and imported seafood supply. First, we conduct a literature review to identify the climate risk for sea food security, and then, we analyse the domestic production of both the marine fishing catch and aquaculture. This study also examines the critical problems of the imported seafood supply and applies a comparative analysis of impact type and differences in the top 10 seafood import countries to organize adaptation strategies to climate change. Moreover, due to the type of climate impact and the differences between long-term climate impact and extreme climate impact, we collect and compile the existing climate adaptation strategies of fishery production, seafood importing, and the demand and supply of seafood in Taiwan. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis to seek any deficiencies in the existing climate adaptation strategies and offer new adaptation guidelines based on the existing climate adaptation strategies. The results show that Taiwan's major adaptation strategies have been precautionary mitigation measures. In terms of resilience management, only the buffer stock scheme plan and the stabilization funds method are selected for some specific species to mitigate the short-term fluctuation in both yield and price for imported domestic seafood. However, we will confront uncertainties stemming from global climate change in the future; the existing climate adaptation strategies of Taiwan are still not sufficient to respond to climate impacts. For example, the climate change early warning system is still very inadequate, the existing scientific knowledge is insufficient, and the current adaptation strategies are insufficient for resolving the fluctuations in the market mechanism of seafood. According to the principles of risk management, the adaptation strategies recommended in this study can be differentiated into two categories: precautionary mitigation measures can be used to adapt to domestic production and uncertainties; such measures include avoidance, transfer, and reduction to prevent the frequency and consequences of climate change for building a resilient fisheries sector. Moreover, resilience management (e.g., risk retention) can be used to respond to uncertainties in supply for adjusting production and mitigating the risks of climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The climate system is a classical spatiotemporal evolutionary dynamic system with spatiotemporal correlation characteristics. Based on this, two-dimensional detrended fluctuation analysis (TD-DFA) is used to estimate the Hurst exponent of two-dimensional images. Then, we monitored the change of the Hurst exponent of the images to identify an abrupt dynamic change. We tested the performance of this method with a coupled spatiotemporal dynamic model and found that it works well. The changes in the Hurst exponents of the spatial images are stable when there is no dynamic change in the system, but there will be a clear non-stationary change of the Hurst exponents; for example, the abrupt mean values change if the dynamics of the system change. Thus, the TD-DFA method is suitable for detecting an abrupt dynamic change from natural and artificial images. The spatial images of the NCEP reanalysis of the daily average temperature exhibited fractality. Based on this, we found three non-stationary changes in the Hurst exponents for the NCEP reanalysis of the daily average temperature or for the annual average temperature in the region (60A degrees S-60A degrees N). It can be concluded that the climate system may have incurred three dynamic changes since 1961 on decadal timescales, i.e., in approximately the mid-1970s, the mid-1980s, and between the late 1990s and the early 2000s.},

This reversal to glacial-like conditions is one of the best known examples of abrupt change but the exact timing and global spatial extent remain uncertain. Whilst the wider Atlantic region has a network of high-resolution proxy records spanning GS-1, the Pacific Ocean suffers from a scarcity of sub-decadally resolved sequences. Here we report the results from an investigation into a tree-ring chronology from northern New Zealand aimed at addressing the paucity of data. The conifer tree species kauri (Agathis australis) is known from contemporary studies to be sensitive to regional climate changes. An analysis of a `historic' 452-year kauri chronology confirms a tropical-Pacific teleconnection via the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We then focus our study on a 1010-year sub-fossil kauri chronology that has been precisely dated by comprehensive radiocarbon dating and contains a striking ring-width downturn between 12,500 and 12,380 cal BP within GS-1. Wavelet analysis shows a marked increase in ENSO-like periodicities occurring after the downturn event. Comparison to low-and mid-latitude Pacific records suggests a coherency with ENSO and Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation change during this period. The driver(s) for this climate event remain unclear but may be related to solar changes that subsequently led to establishment and/or increased expression of ENSO across the mid-latitudes of the Pacific, seemingly independent of the Atlantic and polar regions.

We assess this clinically important feature of the longitudinal HIV/AIDS data using the bent-cable framework within a growth mixture Tobit model. To account for heterogeneity of drug resistance among subjects, the parameters of the bent-cable growth mixture Tobit model are also allowed to differ by subgroups (subpopulations) of patients classified into latent classes on the basis of trajectories of observed viral load data with skewness and left-censoring. The proposed methods are illustrated using real data from an AIDS clinical study. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Ecological shifts in shallow lakes from clear-water macrophyte-dominated to turbid-water phytoplankton-dominated are generally thought of as rapid short-term transitions. Diatom remains in sediment records from shallow lakes in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America provide new evidence that the long-term ecological stability of these lakes is defined by the legacy of large regime shifts. We examine the modern and historical stability of 11 shallow lakes. Currently, four of the lakes are in a clear-water state, three are consistently turbid-water, and four have been observed to change state from year to year (transitional). Lake sediment records spanning the past 150-200 yr suggest that (1) the diatom assemblage is characteristic of either clear or turbid lakes, (2) prior to significant landscape alteration, all of the lakes existed in a regime of a stable clear-water state, (3) lakes that are currently classified as turbid or transitional have experienced one strong regime shift over the past 150-200 yr and have since remained in a regime where turbid-water predominates, and (4) top-down impacts to the lake food-web from fish introductions appear to be the dominant driver of strong regime shifts and not increased nutrient availability. Based on our findings we demonstrate a method that could be used by lake managers to identify lakes that have an ecological history close to the clear-turbid regime threshold; such lakes might more easily be returned to a clear-water state through biomanipulation. The unfortunate reality is that many of these lakes are now part of a managed landscape and will likely require continued intervention.},

With IMS networks widespread deployment, SIP flooding attacks are becoming into a major threat to IMS network. However, the existing SIP flooding attack detection schemes are inefficient for detecting low rate SIP flooding attacks and are lacking in poor recovery for detecting high-rate SIP flooding attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel SIP flooding attack detection scheme with the internal and external detection features in IMS networks, called SFADS (SIP flooding attack detection scheme). In SFADS, based on the analysis of SIP flooding attacks, we first extract the abrupt change of SIP session request as the external detection feature, and the abnormal abrupt change of difference between the sequence of legitimate SIP session establishment and the SIP session request messages as the internal detection feature. Then we use the improved cumulative sum control chart algorithm to analyze the two detection features. Finally, we take the analysis data as inputs and adopt Fuzzy Logic to detect SIP flooding attacks. To investigate the detection performance of the proposed SFADS, we conduct simulations with the prototype implement in an IMS network testbed. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed SFADS is better than that of other schemes.},

We design a novel composite stopping rule and prove that it is asymptotically optimal of third order under a weighted Lorden's criterion for detection delay. We also develop the strategy to identify the post-change drift and analyze the conditional identification error asymptotically. Our composite rules are based on CUSUM stopping times, as well as their reaction periods, namely the times between the last reset of the CUSUM statistic process and the CUSUM alarm. The established results shed new light on the performance of CUSUM strategies under model uncertainty and offer strong asymptotic optimality results in this framework.},

Tree-ring reconstructions of forest disturbance can inform restoration and management plans by placing these changes into a historical context. This study examined forest disturbance with regard to land use change and drought in the New River Gorge region of West Virginia. I developed a 182-year pitch pine (Pinus rigida) growth chronology (1833-2014) using samples collected from 33 trees along 2 km of south-and southwest-facing slopes at Babcock State Park. Samples cut from fire-scarred pitch and Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana) were used to generate a fire chronology for the site. Temporal trends in pitch pine growth variability were assessed using regime shift and growth release detection methods. There was no change in pitch pine growth during the transition from the early settlement to industrial era (ca. 1885), while a significant decrease in annual growth variability characterized the post-industrial era (1963-2014). Seventeen fire events were recorded between 1887 and 1968. Growth releases displayed a temporal relationship with fire and there was a strong, but not significant, association between drought and fire years. These results suggest a coupled system in which anthropogenic fires driven by periodic drought maintained pitch pine before and during industrialization. Reintroducing fire to the post-industrial forest may not meet management objectives as decades of fire exclusion have altered forest fuels and species composition such that its effects would be difficult to predict.},

The predicted impedance samples are obtained using the Kalman filter and Taylor expansion, which are used in this paper to track the phasor precisely. Second order of Taylor expansion is used to decrease the corrugation effect of impedance estimation and increase the reliability of the proposed method. Furthermore, in order to increase the selectivity of the proposed method, the proposed index is armed with phase comparison logic to detect internal faults. The instantaneous estimation and prediction capability of the Kalman filter are two reasons for proposing the use of Kalman filter.

Under the assumptions that the planned motion is smooth enough and that the gravity with respect to the joint variable is continuous, the detection strategy presented here can work fast and efficiently. A prototype with one degree of freedom (DOF) has been built to verify the given approach. Experiment results reveal that the proposed method is valid in different situations.

A 94-cm-long core, covering c. 90 years of age, was analysed at 1 cm resolution for subfossil cladocerans, diatoms and other proxies. Prior to river regulation (c. 1930), the littoral to planktonic ratios of cladocerans and diatoms, and bulk sediment delta C-13 values were high, while the period from c. 1930 to c. 1970 experienced considerable changes to the wetland ecosystem. The abrupt nature of changes of planktonic cladocerans and diatoms, particularly after the onset of river regulation (1930s), was triggered by inundation, high rates of sedimentation and shifts in bulk sediment delta N-15 values. However, the transition of a once littoral-dominated community, to one favouring an increasingly turbid, plankton-dominated trophic condition following river regulation was relatively slow and lasted for decades. The progression to a new regime was likely delayed by the partial recovery of submerged plant communities and related internal dynamics.},

	abstract = {Quantitative evidence of sudden shifts in ecological structure and function in large shallow lakes is rare, even though they provide essential benefits to society. Such regime shifts' can be driven by human activities which degrade ecological stability including water level control (WLC) and nutrient loading. Interactions between WLC and nutrient loading on the long-term dynamics of shallow lake ecosystems are, however, often overlooked and largely underestimated, which has hampered the effectiveness of lake management. Here, we focus on a large shallow lake (Lake Chaohu) located in one of the most densely populated areas in China, the lower Yangtze River floodplain, which has undergone both WLC and increasing nutrient loading over the last several decades. We applied a novel methodology that combines consistent evidence from both paleolimnological records and ecosystem modeling to overcome the hurdle of data insufficiency and to unravel the drivers and underlying mechanisms in ecosystem dynamics. We identified the occurrence of two regime shifts: one in 1963, characterized by the abrupt disappearance of submerged vegetation, and another around 1980, with strong algal blooms being observed thereafter. Using model scenarios, we further disentangled the roles of WLC and nutrient loading, showing that the 1963 shift was predominantly triggered by WLC, whereas the shift ca. 1980 was attributed to aggravated nutrient loading. Our analysis also shows interactions between these two stressors. Compared to the dynamics driven by nutrient loading alone, WLC reduced the critical P loading and resulted in earlier disappearance of submerged vegetation and emergence of algal blooms by approximately 26 and 10years, respectively. Overall, our study reveals the significant role of hydrological regulation in driving shallow lake ecosystem dynamics, and it highlights the urgency of using multi-objective management criteria that includes ecological sustainability perspectives when implementing hydrological regulation for aquatic ecosystems around the globe.},

The model predicts quartic energy-momentum dispersions despite quadratic or linear ones, which is also the origin of the strong singularity. Starting with this model and using first principles density functional theory calculations, a family of novel two-dimensional materials that actually display such singularities are identified and their extraordinary features are investigated. The strong singularity gives rise to ferromagnetic instability with an inverse-square-root temperature dependence and the quartic dispersion is responsible for a steplike transmission spectrum, which is a characteristic feature of one-dimensional systems. Because of the abrupt change in transmission at the band edge, these materials have temperature-independent thermopower and enhanced thermoelectric efficiencies. Nitrogene has exceptionally high thermoelectric efficiencies at temperatures down to 50 K, which could make low temperature thermoelectric applications possible.},

	abstract = {The scaling exponent is an effective nonlinear dynamic index, which can be used to detect the dynamic structure mutations of the correlation time series by the moving cut a fixed window technology. The immediacy and accuracy of scaling exponent is very important for detecting the series change points, however, some of the existing scale index calculation methods (such as rescaled range analysis and rescaled variance analysis) take none of these into account. Wavelet transform analysis can quickly decompose the sequence on different scales, and then the scaling index can be calculated by analyzing the scaling relation of wavelet coefficients on different scales, which has the characteristics of fast calculation speed and good convergence and memory saving. By moving cut window technology, in the present paper we put forward a new method, i.e., the moving cut data-wavelet transformation for detecting a series of dynamic structure mutations. The principle is that the removal of the data has little effect on the estimation of the scaling exponents of the correlation time series with the same dynamical properties. In order to test the performance of the method, first of all, the dynamic structure mutation analyses of linear ideal time series and nonlinear ideal time series are carried out by selecting different moving cut fixed windows. The test results show that the method can quickly and accurately detect the dynamic structure change points and intervals both in linear time series and nonlinear time series, besides, its calculation speed is obviously better than the moving cut data-rescaled range analysis and the moving cut data-rescaled variance analysis. It has strong stability, and depends less on the moving cut window length, which will have some advantages in the large data processing. At the same time, in order to detect the influence of noise on the method, the linear and nonlinear ideal time series are added to the white Gaussian noise (S N R = 2 0, 25, 30 dB), respectively, and the results show that the method has a strong anti-noise ability with different moving cut window lengths, can still quickly and accurately detect the mutation point or interval in different noise additions. Finally, the method is used to detect the dynamic structure mutation of measured daily maximum temperature data of Foping station in Wei basin, the experimental results indicate that the mutation interval is consistent with the abrupt change in 1970's on a global scale, which further verifies the validity of the method.},

Whilst the significance of these discontinuities to the overall development of the mountain belt is still being investigated, their identification and characterization has become important for potential correlations across regions, and for constraining the kinematic framework of the mid-crust. The result of new phase equilibria modelling, trace element analysis and high-precision Lu-Hf garnet dating of the metapelites from the Likhu Khola region in east central Nepal, combined with the previously published monazite petrochronology data confirms the presence of one of such cryptic thrust-sense tectonometamorphic discontinuities within the lower portion of the exhumed metamorphic core and provides new constraints on the P-T estimates for that region. The location of the discontinuity is marked by an abrupt change in the nature of P-T-t paths of the rocks across it. The rocks in the footwall are characterized by a prograde burial P-T path with peak metamorphic conditions of similar to 660 degrees C and similar to 9.5kbar likely in the mid-to-late Miocene, which are overlain by the hanging wall rocks, that preserve retrograde P-T paths with P-T conditions of {\textgreater}700 degrees C and similar to 7kbar in the early Miocene. The occurrence of this thrust-sense structure that separates rock units with unique metamorphic histories is compatible with orogenic models that identify a spatial and temporal transition from early midcrustal deformation and metamorphism in the deeper hinterland to later deformation and metamorphism towards the shallower foreland of the orogen. Moreover, these observations are comparable with those made across other discontinuities at similar structural levels along the Himalaya, confirming their importance as important orogen-scale structures.},

	abstract = {Many abrupt climate change events often cannot be detected timely by conventional abrupt detection methods until a few years after these events have occurred. The reason for this lag in detection is that abundant and long-term observational data are required for accurate abrupt change detection by these methods, especially for the detection of a regime shift. So, these methods cannot help us understand and forecast the evolution of the climate system in a timely manner. Obviously, spatial images, generated by a coupled spatiotemporal dynamical model, contain more information about a dynamic system than a single time series, and we find that spatial images show the fractal properties. The fractal properties of spatial images can be quantitatively characterized by the Hurst exponent, which can be estimated by two-dimensional detrended fluctuation analysis (TD-DFA). Based on this, TD-DFA is used to detect an abrupt dynamic change of a coupled spatiotemporal model. The results show that the TD-DFA method can effectively detect abrupt parameter changes in the coupled model by monitoring the changing in the fractal properties of spatial images. The present method provides a new way for abrupt dynamic change detection, which can achieve timely and efficient abrupt change detection results.},

Materials and Methods: Google News was used to search U.S. news sites over a 9-year period (2006-2015) based on the search terms “mammography” and “mammogram.” The top 100 search results were recorded. Identified articles were manually reviewed. Results: The top 100 news articles were from the following sources: local news outlet (50\%), national news outlet (24\%), nonimaging medical source (13\%), entertainment or culture news outlet (6\%), business news outlet (4\%), peer-reviewed journal (1\%), and radiology news outlet (1\%). Most common major themes were the screening mammography controversy (29\%), description of a new breast imaging technology (23\%), dense breasts (11\%), and promotion of a public screening initiative (11\%). For the most recent year, article stance toward screening mammography was 59\%, favorable; 16\%, unfavorable; and 25\%, neutral. After 2010, there was an abrupt shift in articles' stances from neutral to both favorable and unfavorable. Conclusions: A wide range of online news sources addressed a range of issues related to mammography. National, rather than local, news sites were more likely to focus on the screening controversy and more likely to take an unfavorable view. The controversial United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines may have influenced articles to take a stance on screening mammography. As such online news may impact public perception of the topic and thus potentially impact guideline adherence, radiologists are encouraged to maintain awareness of this online coverage and to support the online dissemination of reliable and accurate information.},

Although various changes may occur in a dynamic social network, they can be classified into two categories, gradual changes and abrupt changes. Many researchers have attempted to propose a method to discover communities in dynamic social networks with various changes more accurately. Most of them have assumed that changes in dynamic social networks occur gradually. This presumption for the dynamic social network in which abrupt changes may occur misleads the problem. Few methods have tried to detect abrupt changes, but they used the statistical approach which has such disadvantages as the need for a lot of snapshots. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect the type of changes using the least information of social networks and then, apply it to a new community detection framework named change-aware model. The experimental results on different benchmark and real-life datasets confirmed that the new method and framework have improved the performance of community detection algorithms.},

	abstract = {Various models have been proposed to predict changes in scalar concentrations and surface fluxes following an abrupt change in surface conditions. In most cases the boundary conditions used to describe the surface represent limiting cases such as a step change in either concentration, flux or surface resistance. Three main conclusions emerge from a review of experimental results published thus far. Firstly, a dry-to-wet transition can be treated as a step change in concentration, after which the difference between the downwind and upwind surface fluxes show a power-law dependence on distance from the leading edge with an exponent of the order of -1/6. Secondly, wet-to-dry transitions should be treated as resulting in a step change in flux. This has not always been appreciated. Thirdly, a dry-to-moist (e.g. irrigated) transition is shown to resemble more closely a step change in flux than a step change in surface resistance. This can only be explained if stomatal resistance varies in conjunction with downwind changes in saturation deficit. We propose a simple analytical model to describe the streamwise change in surface resistance in the limit of a step change in flux. A scarcity of published data suitable for validation of this model has led us to undertake a new experimental investigation. This experiment is the subject of a companion paper.},

In the experiment, rat mesentery was used as the sample of biological membranes, and the refractive index of the mesentery was measured precisely as the sample temperature was changed. Abrupt change in both the index and transmission of the mesentery can be found in the temperature range of 38 degrees C to 42 degrees C, which is good agreement with the temperature range for the gel-to-liquid phase transition of the artificial (liposomal) membrane. Our method does not require any treatments, including fragmentation and centrifugation, for extraction of phospholipid bilayers from biological membranes. It, therefore, is a useful method for in vivo measurement and analysis of the membrane functions.},

	abstract = {While color Doppler flow mapping has yielded a quick and relatively sensitive method for visualizing the turbulent jets generated in valvular insufficiency, quantification of the degree of valvular insufficiency has been limited by the dependence of visualization of turbulent jets on hemodynamic as well as instrument-related factors. Color Doppler flow imaging, however, does have the capability of reliably showing the spatial relations of laminar flows. An area where flow accelerates proximal to a regurgitant orifice is commonly visualized on the left ventricular side of a mitral regurgitant orifice, especially when imaging is performed with high grain and a low pulse repetition frequency. This area of flow convergence, where the flow stream narrows symmetrically, can be quantified because velocity and the flow cross-sectional area change in inverse proportion along streamlines centered at the orifice. In this study, a gravity-driven constant-flow system with five sharp-edges diaphragm orifices (ranging from 2.9 to 12 mm in diameter) was imaged both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of flow through the orifice. Color Doppler flow images were produced by zero shifting so that the abrupt change in display color occurred at different velocities. This “aliasing boundary” with a known velocity and a measurable radial distance from the center of the orifice was used to determine an isovelocity hemisphere such that flow rate through the orifice was calculated as 2-pi-r2 x V(r), where r is the radial distance from the center of the orifice to the color change and V(r) is the velocity at which the color change was noted. Using V(r) values from 54 to 14 cm/sec obtained with a 3.75-MHz transducer from 75 to 18 cm/sec obtained with a 2.5-MHz transducer, we calculated flow rates and found them to correlate with measured flow rates (r = 0.94-0.99). The slope of the regression line was closest to unity when the lowest V(r) and the correspondingly largest r were used in calculation. The flow rates estimated from color Doppler flow imaging could also be used in conjunction with continuous-wave Doppler measurements of the maximal velocity of flow through the orifice to calculate orifice areas (r = 0.75-0.96 correlation with measured areas). In a clinical series of 20 patients studied prospectively, radius of the flow convergence area separated patients with angiographically mild from those with moderate (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.001) and patients with angiographically moderate from those with severe (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.005) mitral regurgitation and showed good correlation with the angiographic severity of regurgitation ( r= 0.87). Color Doppler visualization of the flow convergence region is a method that appears promising for providing a calculated value of flow rate for a regurgitant orifice in the cardiovascular system. When used in conjunction with continuous-wave Doppler, color Doppler flow imaging can be used to predict the orifice area.},

While the resonance mode of major longitudinal vibration shifted in an indentation and elasticity dependent manner, a disappearance of the rotational vibration upon contact resulted in abrupt change in resonance frequency which was used to signal touch detection.

	abstract = {We compared a wide range of environmental data with measures of recruitment and stock production for Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus and chub mackerel Scomber japonicus to examine factors potentially responsible for fishery regimes (periods of high or low recruitment and productivity). Environmental factors fall into two groups based on principal component analyses. The first principal component group was determined by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index and was dominated by variables associated with the Southern Oscillation Index and Kuroshio Sverdrup transport. The second was led by the Arctic Oscillation and dominated by variables associated with Kuroshio geostrophic transport. Instantaneous surplus production rates (ISPR) and log recruitment residuals (LNRR) changed within several years of environmental regime shifts and then stabilized due, we hypothesize, to rapid changes in carrying capacity and relaxation of density dependent effects. Like ISPR, LNRR appears more useful than fluctuation in commercial catch data for identifying the onset of fishery regime shifts. The extended Ricker models indicate spawning stock biomass and sea surface temperatures (SST) affect recruitment of sardine while spawning stock biomass, SST and sardine biomass affect recruitment of chub mackerel. Environmental conditions were favorable for sardine during 1969-87 and unfavorable during 1951-67 and after 1988. There were apparent shifts from favorable to unfavorable conditions for chub mackerel during 1976-77 and 1985-88, and from unfavorable to favorable during 1969-70 and 1988-92. Environmental effects on recruitment and surplus production are important but fishing effects are also influential. For example, chub mackerel may have shifted into a new favorable fishery regime in 1992 if fishing mortality had been lower. We suggest that managers consider to shift fishing effort in response to the changing stock productivity, and protect strong year classes by which we may detect new favorable regimes.},

The method is based on using the ideas of segmentation, spectral feature extraction and the identification of EEG epochs containing MA with statistical methods and decisional rules. Full-night EEG recordings from two patients are used to present some initial performance results. For this analysis, the MA events are independently scored by three experienced sleep experts. Results show the method to be promising; however, due to the large inter-scorer variations it may be necessary to tailor the detection threshold to address the varying scorer preferences (address the sensitivity/specificity tradeoffs).},

The interdecadal variability is coupled with the LF mode, suggesting that decadal-interdecadal SST variation is primarily represented by the ENSO-like interdecadal regime shift in the late 1970s.

Non-linear regression showed that survey catch composition strongly responded to local climate at lags of 2 and 4 years, providing evidence of rapid ecological response to climate change in the system. A sequential regime shift detection method identified rapid change in local climate, and in survey and commercial catches following the well-documented regime shift to a positive state of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in 1976/1977. However, the analysis failed to detect the 1998/1999 regime shift in local climate, or in survey or commercial catches. This result is consistent with the view that the 1998/1999 climate regime shift did not represent a reversion to a negative PDO state. Local temperature increased and local sea level pressure decreased in the Gulf of Alaska during the years 2001-2005, consistent with anthropogenic warming and recent spatial reorganization in Arctic climate. There was no evidence of community reorganization following this climate event. Further observation will be required to evaluate the persistence of this new climate pattern, and the nature of community reaction to it. (c) 2006 International Council forthe Exploration ofthe Sea.

	abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to study thermocapillarity-induced flow of thin liquid films covering heated horizontal walls with 2D topography. Design/methodology/approach - A numerical model based on the 2D solution of heat and fluid flow within the liquid film, the gas above the film and the structured wall is developed. The full Navier-Stokes equations are solved and coupled with the energy equation by a finite difference algorithm. The movable gas-liquid interface is tracked by means of the volume-of-fluid method. The model is validated by comparison with theoretical and experimental data showing a good agreement. Findings - It is demonstrated that convective motion within a film on a structured wall exists at any nonzero Marangoni number. The motion is caused by surface tension gradients induced by temperature differences at the gas-liquid interface due to the spatial structure of the heated wall. These simulations predict that the maximal flow velocity is practically independent from the film thickness, and increases with increasing temperature difference between the wall and the surrounding gas. It is found that an abrupt change in wall temperature causes rupture of the liquid film. The thermocapillary convection notably enhances heat transfer in liquid films on heated structured walls. Research limitations/implications - Our solutions are restricted to the case of periodic wall structure, and the flow is enforced to be periodic with a period equal to that of the wall. Practical implications - The reported results are useful for design of the heat transfer equipment. Originality/value - New effects in thermocapillary convection are presented and studied using a developed numerical model.},

	abstract = {A generally accepted basic principle in relation to the use of the noble gas thermometer in groundwater flow systems is that high-frequency noble gas climatic signals are lost due to the effect of dispersion. This loss of signal, combined with C-14 dating issues, makes it only suited to identify major climatic events such as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Consequently, the identification of significant noble gas temperature (NGT) cooling ({\textgreater}= 5 degrees C) with respect to present time has systematically been associated with the occurrence of the LGM even when reasonable water age controls were unavailable. It has also become apparent at a number of studied sites that modem NGTs estimated through standard models [M. Stute, P. Schlosser, Principles and applications of the noble gas paleothermometer, in: P.K. Swart, K.C. Lohmann, J.A. McKenzie, S. Savin, (Eds), Climate change in continental isotopic records, Geophysical monograph 78, AGU (1993) 89-100.; W. Aeschbach-Hertig, F. Peeters, U. Beyerle, R. Kipfer, Paleotemperature reconstruction from noble gases in ground water taking into account equilibration with entrapped air, Nature 405(6790) (2000) 1040-1044.] are unable to reproduce ground temperatures at the interface with the unsaturated zone, a basic requirement for proper paleoclimate reconstruction through noble gases. Instead, a systematic bias to low NGTs in recharge areas is observed. The Carrizo aquifer, in which the LGM was previously identified [M. Stute, P. Schlosser, J.F. Clark, W.S. Broecker, Paleotemperatures in the Southwestern United States derived from noble gases in ground water, Science 256(5059) (1992) 1000-1001.] and which presents an NGT bias of over 4 degrees C, is an ideal setting to analyze and revise basic principles and assumptions in relation with the use of the noble gas thermometer. Here, we present a new noble gas data set (49 measurements) collected at 20 different locations in the Carrizo aquifer. This new data set together with previously published data (20 measurements) was used to calibrate a 3-D groundwater flow and He-4 transport model in which simulations of groundwater age were subsequently carried out. These account for mixing processes due to advection, dispersion, diffusion, and cross-formational flow. We first show that samples previously attributed to the LGM belong in fact to the middle Holocene. Through a step-by-step approach we then proceed to carry out a comparative analysis of both the impact of dispersion on high frequency climatic signals and assumptions underlying competing NGT models. Our combined analysis indicates that groundwater flow systems, at least those with similar characteristics to that of the Carrizo, do have the ability to preserve short term (100-200 yrs) climatic fluctuations archived by noble gases. It also shows that abrupt climate shifts during the mid-late Holocene which are associated with significant NGT changes ({\textgreater}= 5 degrees C) do not reflect equally important changes in the mean annual atmospheric temperature (MAAT). Instead, these reflect the combined effect of atmospheric temperature changes, seasonality of recharge and, above all, significant variations of the water table depth which result from shifts between humid and and regimes. Together with NGTs, our excess air record plays a critical role in identifying such abrupt climate changes. Specifically, the Carrizo combined data set indicates an abrupt shift from a cool, humid regime to a wanner, and one at similar to 1 kyrs BP. A major Holocene (similar to 6 kyrs BP) NGT change of 7.7 degrees C with respect to present now identified is mostly the result of a dramatic water table drop which occurred during the similar to 1 kyrs, BP transition period. Current NGTs in the Carrizo recharge area do not appear to be recording atmospheric changes. Rather, these are recording ground conditions reflecting mostly the impact of heat flow in the area. We also show that observed systematic offsets in NGT recharge areas can be reconciled through NGT estimation models which account for a noble gas partial pressure increase in the unsaturated zone, potentially due to 02 depletion.

A new method known as the sequential t-test algorithm for analysing regime shifts (STARS) is applied to a set of biological state variables as well as environmental and anthropogenic forcing variables in the southern Benguela. The method is able to correct for auto-correlation within time-series by a process known as prewhitening. All variables were tested with and without prewhitening. Shifts that were detected with both methods were termed robust. The STARS method detected shifts in relatively short time-series and identified when these shifts occurred without a priori hypotheses. Shifts were generally well detected at the end of time-series, but further development of the method is needed to enhance its performance for auto-correlated time-series. Since 1950, two major long-term ecosystem changes were identified for the southern Benguela. The first change occurred during the 1960s, caused predominantly by heavy fishing pressure but with some environmental forcing. The second change occurred in the early 2000s, caused mainly by environmental forcing. To strengthen these findings, further analyses should be carried out using different methods.},

	abstract = {Road surface condition is greatly dependent on the surface's friction coefficient. The abrupt change of the coefficient results in variation of wheel slip which likely leads to vehicle instability. Although the vehicle on-board sensors can measure the vehicle's velocities and yaw rate, the measurements, often containing noise and drift, are limited to the surface that the vehicle is engaged. In contrast, an effective observer can be used to estimate the vehicle dynamics for all possible surface conditions. This paper proposes a new observer, called Extended State Observer (ESO) to estimate the three quantities, and more importantly an additional quantity known as system dynamics. With the aid of the ESO, the following three tasks are performed: (1) noise filtering from the measurement data (2) detection and classification of surface condition change, and (3) identification of the road surface. Fuzzy logic was employed to quickly detect the change of road surface condition and further classify the surface; a neural network was employed to help determine the friction coefficient. The dynamic model used in this study can be applied to four-wheel independent drive vehicles. The presented methods were simulated when a vehicle encountered a significant change from a uniform-mu (i.e. uniform friction coefficient) surface to a split-mu surface (i.e. different friction coefficient on each side of the wheels) during cornering.},

	abstract = {In bridge structures, damage may induce an additional deflection which may naturally contain essential information about the damage. However, inverse mapping from the damage-induced deflection to the actual damage location and severity is generally complex, particularly for statically indeterminate systems. In this paper, a new load concept, called the positive-bending-inspection-load (PBIL) is proposed to construct a simple inverse mapping from the damage-induced deflection to the actual damage location. A PBIL for an inspection region is defined as a load or a system of loads which guarantees the bending moment to be positive in the inspection region. From the theoretical investigations, it was proven that the damage-induced chord-wise deflection (DI-CD) has the maximum value with the abrupt change in its slope at the damage location under a PBIL. Hence, a novel damage localization method is proposed based on the DI-CD under a PBIL. The procedure may be summarized as: (1) identification of the modal flexibility matrices from acceleration measurements, (2) design for a PBIL for an inspection region of interest in a structure, (3) calculation of the chord-wise deflections for the PBIL using the modal flexibility matrices, and (4) damage localization by finding the location with the maximum DI-CD with die abrupt change in its slope within the inspection region. Procedures from (2)-(4) can be repeated for several inspection regions to cover the whole structure complementarily. Numerical verification studies were carried out on a simply supported beam and a three-span continuous beam model. Experimental verification study was also carried out on a two-span continuous beam structure with a steel box-girder. It was found that the proposed method can identify the damage existence and damage location for small damage cases with narrow cuts at the bottom flange.},

	abstract = {A wide range of intractable problems such as polluting emissions, noise. accidents, resource depletion, and inaccessibility of amenities are associated with the current transport regime. Given the slow movement towards a more sustainable mobility system, more radical, systemic innovation - a `transition' - is required. Broadly speaking, this may be achieved via three routes: technological change, modal shift, and reduced travel demand. Drawing on concepts from the transitions literature (e.g., [Geels. F.W.: Technological Transitions and System Innovations: A Co-evolutionary and Socio-Technical Analysis, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2005.]), we conceptualise each of these routes as a bundle of niche activities within an Area of Innovation, deviating to differing degrees from the current mobility `regime'. We present empirical evidence and indications of ongoing development of niches in these three areas within the UK and Sweden, and explore processes of co-evolution, divergence and tension within and between niches. Findings indicate recent market penetration of novel transport technologies, more advanced than modal shift or demand management activities; however, different transport technologies are more successful in each country. We also identify examples of a close relationship between development of radical vehicle/fuel technologies and provision of mobility services; and information technology as a driver in all three areas of innovation. We conclude that future innovation in transport depends on diversity, hybridisation, and co-evolution of niches. Finally, policy implications are discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Ecosystems can undergo large-scale changes in their states, known as catastrophic regime shifts, leading to substantial losses to services they provide to humans. These shifts occur rapidly and are difficult to predict. Several early warning signals of such transitions have recently been developed using simple models. These studies typically ignore spatial interactions, and the signal provided by these indicators may be ambiguous. We employ a simple model of collapse of vegetation in one and two spatial dimensions and show, using analytic and numerical studies, that increases in spatial variance and changes in spatial skewness occur as one approaches the threshold of vegetation collapse. We identify a novel feature, an increasing spatial variance in conjunction with a peaking of spatial skewness, as an unambiguous indicator of an impending regime shift. Once a signal has been detected, we show that a quick management action reducing the grazing activity is needed to prevent the collapse of vegetated state. Our results show that the difficulties in obtaining the accurate estimates of indicators arising due to lack of long temporal data can be alleviated when high-resolution spatially extended data are available. These results are shown to hold true independent of various details of model or different spatial dispersal kernels such as Gaussian or heavily fat tailed. This study suggests that spatial data and monitoring multiple indicators of regime shifts can play a key role in making reliable predictions on ecosystem stability and resilience.},

	abstract = {Synthesis The quickly expanding literature on early warning signals for critical transitions in ecosystems suggests that critical slowing down is a key phenomenon to measure the distance to a tipping point in ecosystems. Such work is broadly misinterpreted as showing that slowing down is specific to tipping points. In this contribution, we show why this is not the case. Early warning signals based on critical slowing down indicate a broader class of situations where a system becomes increasingly sensitive to perturbations. Ecosystem responses to external changes can surprise us by their abruptness and irreversibility. Models have helped identifying indicators of impending catastrophic shifts, referred to as ‘generic early warning signals’. These indicators are linked to a phenomenon known as ‘critical slowing down’ which describes the fact that the recovery rate of a system after a perturbation decreases when the system approaches a bifurcation – such as the classical fold bifurcation associated to catastrophic shifts. However, contrary to what has sometimes been suggested in the literature, a decrease in recovery rate cannot be considered as specific to approaching catastrophic shifts. Here, we analyze the behavior of early warning signals based on critical slowing down in systems approaching a range of catastrophic and non-catastrophic situations. Our results show that slowing down generally happens in situations where a system is becoming increasingly sensitive to external perturbations, independently of whether the impeding change is catastrophic or not. These results highlight that indicators specific to catastrophic shifts are still lacking. More importantly, they also imply that in systems where we have no reason to expect catastrophic transitions, slowing down may still be used in a more general sense as a warning signal for a potential decrease in stability.},

We show that some indicators and methods can result in clear early-warning signals, while other methods may have limited utility in ecosystem-based management as they show no or weak potential for early-warning.

	abstract = {Ecosystems often exhibit transitions between multiple dynamic regimes (or steady states), such as the conversion of oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions and associated aquatic ecological communities, due to natural (or increasingly) anthropogenic disturbances. As ecosystems experience perturbations of varying regularity and intensity, they may either remain within the state space neighborhood of the current regime or “flip” into the neighborhood of a regime with different characteristics. An increasingly integral aspect of many ecological, economic, and social decisions is their impact on the sustainability of particular dynamic regimes of ecosystems. Sustainability entails a human preference for one particular regime versus another, and the persistence of that regime with regard to the human and natural perturbations exacted on the system.

Information theory has significantly advanced our ability to quantify the organizational complexity inherent in systems despite imperfect observations or ‘signals’ from the source system. Fisher Information is one of several measures developed under the theme of estimation theory. Fisher Information can be described in three ways: as a measure of the degree to which a parameter (or state of a system) can be estimated; as a measure of the relative amount of information that exists between different states of a system; as a measure of the disorder or chaos of a system. Fisher Information may be a useful measure to identify the degree to which a system is at risk of “flipping” into a different dynamic regime.

We developed a Fisher Information index for dynamic systems in a periodic steady state and applied it to a simple, two species Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model. Changes in the carrying capacity (size) of the system resulted in different stable steady states establishing themselves, each with a characteristic Fisher Information. By repeatedly calculating Fisher Information over time, transitions or “flips” between steady states were identified with changes in Fisher Information. We then examined data collected from four ecological systems (of increasingly large spatial and temporal scale) that have demonstrated regime transitions: the Bering Strait/Pacific Ocean food web; the western Africa savanna; the Florida (USA) pine–oak system; the global climate system. These datasets are noisy and reflect several to many cycles that are out of phase, which complicates the identification of both dynamic regimes and transitions. If transition phases between regimes can be detected early enough, human activity suspected of contributing to regime changes can be altered (or continued if the resultant steady state is desirable, such as in ecosystem restoration efforts).},

	abstract = {Despite advances in our mechanistic understanding of ecological processes, the inherent complexity of real-world ecosystems still limits our ability in predicting ecological dynamics especially in the face of on-going environmental stress. Developing a model is frequently challenged by structure uncertainty, unknown parameters, and limited data for exploring out-of-sample predictions. One way to address this challenge is to look for patterns in the data themselves in order to infer the underlying processes of an ecological system rather than to build system-specific models. For example, it has been recently suggested that statistical changes in ecological dynamics can be used to infer changes in the stability of ecosystems as they approach tipping points. For computer scientists such inference is similar to the notion of a Turing machine: a computational device that could execute a program (the process) to produce the observed data (the pattern). Here, we make use of such basic computational ideas introduced by Alan Turing to recognize changing patterns in ecological dynamics in ecosystems under stress. To do this, we use the concept of Kolmogorov algorithmic complexity that is a measure of randomness. In particular, we estimate an approximation to Kolmogorov complexity based on the Block Decomposition Method (BDM). We apply BDM to identify changes in complexity in simulated time-series and spatial datasets from ecosystems that experience different types of ecological transitions. We find that in all cases, KBDM complexity decreased before all ecological transitions both in time-series and spatial datasets. These trends indicate that loss of stability in the ecological models we explored is characterized by loss of complexity and the emergence of a regular and computable underlying structure. Our results suggest that Kolmogorov complexity may serve as tool for revealing changes in the dynamics of ecosystems close to ecological transitions.},

Large ecosystem changes such as eutrophication, shifts among vegetation types, degradation of coral reefs and regional climate change often come as surprises because we lack leading indicators for regime shifts. Increases in variability of ecosystems have been suggested to foreshadow ecological regime shifts. However, it may be difficult to discern variability due to impending regime shift from that of exogenous drivers that affect the ecosystem. We addressed this problem using a model of lake eutrophication. Lakes are subject to fluctuations in recycling associated with regime shifts, as well as fluctuating nutrient inputs. Despite the complications of noisy inputs, increasing variability of lake-water phosphorus was discernible prior to the shift to eutrophic conditions. Simulations show that rising standard deviation (SD) could signal impending shifts about a decade in advance. The rising SD was detected by studying variability around predictions of a simple time-series model, and did not depend on detailed knowledge of the actual ecosystem dynamics.},

Recent studies of populations in the field and in the laboratory have used time-series data to confirm some of the theoretically predicted early warning indicators, such as an increase in recovery time or in the size and timescale of fluctuations3,4,5,6. However, the predictive power of temporal warning signals is limited by the demand for long-term observations. Large-scale spatial data are more accessible, but the performance of warning signals in spatially extended systems7,8,9,10 needs to be examined empirically3,11,12,13. Here we use spatially extended yeast populations, an experimental system with a fold bifurcation (tipping point)6, to evaluate early warning signals based on spatio-temporal fluctuations and to identify a novel spatial warning indicator. We found that two leading indicators based on fluctuations increased before collapse of connected populations; however, the magnitudes of the increases were smaller than those observed in isolated populations, possibly because local variation is reduced by dispersal. Furthermore, we propose a generic indicator based on deterministic spatial patterns, which we call ‘recovery length’. As the spatial counterpart of recovery time14, recovery length is the distance necessary for connected populations to recover from spatial perturbations. In our experiments, recovery length increased substantially before population collapse, suggesting that the spatial scale of recovery can provide a superior warning signal before tipping points in spatially extended systems.},

	abstract = {In areas of the North Pacific that are largely free of overfishing, climate regime shifts – abrupt changes in modes of low-frequency climate variability – are seen as the dominant drivers of decadal-scale ecological variability. We assessed the ability of leading modes of climate variability [Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), Pacific-North American Pattern (PNA), North Pacific Index (NPI), El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)] to explain decadal-scale (1965–2008) patterns of climatic and biological variability across two North Pacific ecosystems (Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea). Our response variables were the first principle component (PC1) of four regional climate parameters [sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure (SLP), freshwater input, ice cover], and PCs 1–2 of 36 biological time series [production or abundance for populations of salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), groundfish, herring (Clupea pallasii), shrimp, and jellyfish]. We found that the climate modes alone could not explain ecological variability in the study region. Both linear models (for climate PC1) and generalized additive models (for biology PC1–2) invoking only the climate modes produced residuals with significant temporal trends, indicating that the models failed to capture coherent patterns of ecological variability. However, when the residual climate trend and a time series of commercial fishery catches were used as additional candidate variables, resulting models of biology PC1–2 satisfied assumptions of independent residuals and out-performed models constructed from the climate modes alone in terms of predictive power. As measured by effect size and Akaike weights, the residual climate trend was the most important variable for explaining biology PC1 variability, and commercial catch the most important variable for biology PC2. Patterns of climate sensitivity and exploitation history for taxa strongly associated with biology PC1–2 suggest plausible mechanistic explanations for these modeling results. Our findings suggest that, even in the absence of overfishing and in areas strongly influenced by internal climate variability, climate regime shift effects can only be understood in the context of other ecosystem perturbations.},

We document a biochemical effect of climate-induced community transitions in boreal oceans: opposite population trajectories of lipid-rich and lipid-poor fish species. We compared published estimates of fish lipid content and population trajectories following climate shifts in 4 areas (Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Scotian Shelf and North Sea). In all cases, total lipid content differed between species that increased and decreased in abundance, and the resulting relatively lipid-rich or lipid-poor communities persisted for decades. We hypothesize that these changes in fish community lipid content are the result of climate-mediated changes in the availability of essential fatty acids (EFAs), which are required by fish as components of hormones and cell membranes. EFAs are produced only by plants and must be obtained by fish through their diet, and ecosystem EFA availability is sensitive to physical forcing mechanisms. Using original data from 5 species of northeast Pacific fish (total lipid 1.0 to 28.9\% wet mass) and published data for 29 species of myctophids (total lipid 0.5 to 46.3\% wet mass), we found that the content of 2 important EFAs was positively correlated with total lipid content. This result suggests the possibility of species differences in EFA requirements that are related to total lipid content, and possible differences in susceptibility to changing EFA availability in lipid-rich and lipid-poor fish species.},

	abstract = {We used an indicator approach to address outstanding questions concerning the ecological importance of low-frequency climate variability in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Our data consist of a previously-published set of 33 climate and 64 biology time series, updated by us for the years 1965–2011 (for climate data) and 1965–2008 (for biology data). A model-selection approach showed that the first axis of variability in large-scale climate indices (PC1ci), the first and second axes for local climate parameters (PC1cp and PC2cp) and the second axis for biological variability (PC2biol) all showed temporal variability best described by abrupt shifts. In contrast, PC1biol showed gradual, rather than abrupt, temporal variability, suggesting that the leading axis of biological variability was not dominated by abrupt transitions following climate regime shifts. The leading mode of variability in detrended North Pacific sea surface temperature, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, showed reduced amplitude from the late 1980s until the mid-2000s, and we found that this change in PDO behavior was associated with a decline in the strength of the leading pattern of basin-scale biological variability (PC1biol). A reversion to a PDO-negative state in the winter of 2007/08 was associated with the largest observed annual change in the PC1bio–PC2bio phase space, suggesting renewed ecological importance of the PDO. However, a subset of biology time series (n=23) for which more recent data were available did not show persistent change in PC1bio or PC2bio during 2008–2011, thus failing to support the hypothesis of widespread ecological response to the putative 2007/08 shift. To further assess the possible ecological importance of low-frequency climate variability in recent years, we compared changes in the PDO-North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) phase space for 2007/08 with ecologically important (1976/77) and less important (1988/89) climate regime shifts of the past. We found that all three shifts involved PDO-NPGO variability of similar magnitude (i.e., similar pulse disturbances), but that the 1976/77 shift was followed by a period of stability in a new climate state (i.e., strong press disturbance), while the 1988/89 shift was not followed by a period of stability (weak press disturbance). Data through 2013 suggest that the press disturbance following 2007/08 is similar to that following 1976/77, implying that the putative 2007/08 shift may eventually prove to be ecologically important. Our “pulse-press” approach provides a formal framework for distinguishing transient and persistent climate perturbations at the ends of time series.},

The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of spatial pattern rescales system dynamics into spatial frequencies where early warnings may be sharpened. We analyzed four spatial ecological models with the DFT. Different models represented single species in discrete and continuous time, and two different prey-harvester systems. In all four systems, the DFT of transient data exhibited substantial increases prior to the critical transitions. The DFT adds to the arsenal of early warning indicators for spatially structured ecosystems. In addition it provides information about the spatial frequencies where destabilization first begins.},

We present a conceptual framework that will enhance our ability to detect, predict and manage regime shifts in the ocean, illustrating our approach with three well-documented examples: the North Pacific, the North Sea and Caribbean coral reefs.

In particular, marine systems are much more responsive to decadal scale alterations in their physical environment but are also much more adaptable. Thus it is difficult, and probably counterproductive, to try to define a baseline state for marine ecosystems. Further, regime shifts in fish communities can have major economic consequences without being ecological disasters. Climatic changes at decadal scales, from natural or anthropogenic causes, are likely to produce or enhance regime shifts. There are different management issues in different sectors. The coastal zone demands our intervention to assure integrated management of the land and sea components. At the other extreme, our understanding of open ocean systems is an essential element of climate prediction and so of eventual management. Between these two environments, our use of resources in continental shelf seas requires an ability to distinguish between human and natural causes of long-term change.},

The evidence reveals that the likelihood of regime shifts may increase when humans reduce resilience by such actions as removing response diversity, removing whole functional groups of species, or removing whole trophic levels; impacting on ecosystems via emissions of waste and pollutants and climate change; and altering the magnitude, frequency, and duration of disturbance regimes. The combined and often synergistic effects of those pressures can make ecosystems more vulnerable to changes that previously could be absorbed. As a consequence, ecosystems may suddenly shift from desired to less desired states in their capacity to generate ecosystem services. Active adaptive management and governance of resilience will be required to sustain desired ecosystem states and transform degraded ecosystems into fundamentally new and more desirable configurations.},

Scottish fisheries research vessel data collected during the months July-September over the period 1929-53 are compared with more recent August groundfish survey data covering the period 1980-93. Trends in the whole groundfish assemblage, and in a subset of the assemblage that is not targeted by commercial fisheries, are described. 2. Long-term differences in species assemblage were subtle, and were most apparent in the dominance structure. Species diversity in the whole groundfish assemblage was marginally greater in the period 1929-53, but no difference was apparent within the non-target species assemblage. For the whole groundfish assemblage, diversity was greatest in the inshore region and least in the offshore area, but there was no obvious spatial gradient for the non-target species assemblage. 3. Multivariate analyses indicated long-term changes and between-area differences in the species composition for both the whole groundfish assemblage and the non-target species subset. More detailed examination of the data revealed that the long-term changes resulted from relatively small and subtle differences in the relative abundance of rarer species, such as grey gurnard Eutrigla gurnardus (L.) and spur-dog Squalus acanthius L.. In contrast, changes in the relative abundance of the more common species, such as Norway pout Trisopterus esmarkii (Nilsson) and whiting Merlangius merlangus (L.), explained much of the between-area variation. 4. Examination of species aggregated length-frequency distributions suggested that by the 1980s there had been a shift towards assemblages in which smaller fish were more highly represented. This was only apparent, however, in the whole groundfish species assemblage; the length-frequency distributions of non-targeted species were almost identical in the two time periods. 5. Overall, the results suggest that, although differences in the structure of the whole fish assemblage can be detected, the non-target groundfish assemblage appears to have remained relatively unchanged, despite a century of intensive fishing activity.},

	abstract = {Ecological regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning indicators of impending shifts. A critical question, however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or shoreline development (only gradual restoration is possible). The model represents key features of a broad class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers can only be manipulated gradually management action is needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated, often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is also dependent on developing policy processes that enable society to respond more rapidly to information about impending regime shifts.},

	abstract = {The index of the North Atlantic Oscillation, the dominant mode of climatic variability in the North Atlantic region, changed in the late 1980s (1987–1989) from a negative to a positive phase. This led to regime shifts in the ecology of the North Sea (NS) and the central Baltic Sea (CBS), which involved all trophic levels in the pelagial of these two neighbouring continental shelf seas. Increasing air and sea surface temperatures, which affected critical physical and biological processes, were the main direct and indirect driving forces. After 1987, phytoplankton biomass in both systems increased and the growing season was extended. The composition of phyto- and zooplankton communities in both seas changed conspicuously, e.g. dinoflagellate abundance increased and diatom abundance decreased in the CBS. Key copepod species that are essential in fish diets experienced pronounced changes in biomass. Abundance of Calanus finmarchicus (NS) and Pseudocalanus sp. (CBS) fell to low levels, whereas C. helgolandicus (NS) and Temora longicornis and Acartia spp. (CBS) were persistently abundant. These changes in biomass of different copepod species had dramatic consequences on biomass, fisheries, and landings of key fish species: North Sea cod declined, cod in the CBS remained at low levels, and CBS sprat reached unprecedented high biomass levels resulting in high yields. The synchronous regime shifts in NS and CBS resulted in profound changes in both marine ecosystems. However, the reaction of fish populations to the bottom-up mechanisms caused by the same climatic shift was very different for the three fish stocks.},

	abstract = {It is now widely accepted that a climatic regime shift transpired in the North Pacific Ocean in the winter of 1976–77. This regime shift has had far reaching consequences for the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific. Despite the strength and scope of the changes initiated by the shift, it was 10–15 years before it was fully recognized. Subsequent research has suggested that this event was not unique in the historical record but merely the latest in a succession of climatic regime shifts. In this study, we assembled 100 environmental time series, 31 climatic and 69 biological, to determine if there is evidence for common regime signals in the 1965–1997 period of record. Our analysis reproduces previously documented features of the 1977 regime shift, and identifies a further shift in 1989 in some components of the North Pacific ecosystem. The 1989 changes were neither as pervasive as the 1977 changes nor did they signal a simple return to pre-1977 conditions. A notable feature of the 1989 regime shift is the relative clarity that is found in biological records, which contrasts with the relative lack of clear changes expressed by indices of Pacific climate. Thus, the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific and Bering Sea appear to filter climate variability strongly, and respond nonlinearly to environmental forcing. We conclude that monitoring North Pacific and Bering Sea ecosystems may allow for an earlier identification of regime shifts than is possible from monitoring climate data alone.},

Understanding if such anthropogenic disturbances influence organisms that are dependent upon estuarine wetlands remains unclear. We developed an index of marsh bird community integrity (IMBCI) to evaluate marsh bird communities and wetland condition. During the 2002 and 2003 summers, we detected 30 bird species at 219 point count locations distributed among 96 wetlands. IMBCI scores for each wetland were used to determine whether wetland habitat characteristics and urban/suburban development, agriculture, and forest at three different spatial scales (watershed, 1000-m buffer, and 500-m buffer) influenced marsh bird community integrity. We found no relationship between IMBCI scores and wetland habitat characteristics, implying that marsh bird community integrity is not related to any single plant community. Nonparametric changepoint analysis indicated that marsh bird community integrity was significantly reduced when the amount of urban/suburban development within 500 m and 1000m of the marsh exceeded 14\% and 25\%, respectively. There was no effect of urban/suburban development on IMBCI scores at the watershed scale. The results of our study demonstrate that marsh bird community integrity shows a threshold response to urban/suburban development at local scales. IMBCI scores, combined with the identification of a land-use threshold, can be easy to interpret and may help communicate complex ecological data to natural resource managers and conservation planners.},

This process, known as regime shift, is occurring globally: previously super-diverse reefs are becoming dominated by macroalgae instead of coral, losing animal biodiversity and potentially ecosystem services as a result. Regime shift is not ubiquitous however, and perturbed reefs can also recover to their coral-dominated state. Nicholas Graham and colleagues used long-term data from 21 perturbed reefs in the Indo-Pacific region to examine the factors predisposing a reef to recovery or regime shift. By way of this natural experiment, they identify thresholds for characteristics such as structural complexity, water depth and fish density that predict reef responses to an extreme weather event. These results improve our understanding of one of the greatest threats to marine biodiversity and could enable pre-emptive action to mitigate climate change effects on tropical coral reefs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Ecosystems can undergo large-scale changes in their states, known as catastrophic regime shifts, leading to substantial losses to services they provide to humans. These shifts occur rapidly and are difficult to predict. Several early warning signals of such transitions have recently been developed using simple models. These studies typically ignore spatial interactions, and the signal provided by these indicators may be ambiguous. We employ a simple model of collapse of vegetation in one and two spatial dimensions and show, using analytic and numerical studies, that increases in spatial variance and changes in spatial skewness occur as one approaches the threshold of vegetation collapse. We identify a novel feature, an increasing spatial variance in conjunction with a peaking of spatial skewness, as an unambiguous indicator of an impending regime shift. Once a signal has been detected, we show that a quick management action reducing the grazing activity is needed to prevent the collapse of vegetated state. Our results show that the difficulties in obtaining the accurate estimates of indicators arising due to lack of long temporal data can be alleviated when high-resolution spatially extended data are available. These results are shown to hold true independent of various details of model or different spatial dispersal kernels such as Gaussian or heavily fat tailed. This study suggests that spatial data and monitoring multiple indicators of regime shifts can play a key role in making reliable predictions on ecosystem stability and resilience.},

	abstract = {Although alternative stable states are commonly found in simple models, it seems reasonable to assume that the response of real ecosystems to environmental change should often be smoothed by spatial heterogeneity and other stabilizing mechanisms. Here, we systematically explore the effect of spatial heterogeneity on regime shifts for three different models, which we run on a one-dimensional lattice with different spatial distributions of an environmental factor (e.g., soil fertility, water level). If dispersion between patches is negligible, the response to gradual change in some overall Stressor (e.g., precipitation, nutrient load) is straightforward. Because of the environmental heterogeneity, each patch shifts to the other stable state at different values of the overall control variable. Therefore, the response of the ecosystem as a whole is gradual (i.e., the average of many asynchronous small shifts) instead of catastrophic. However, in response to a reverse change in the global Stressor, the system always shows hysteresis, as each individual patch shifts back to the original state at a different value of the control parameter than the critical threshold for the forward shift. If dispersion between patches occurs, the response to change in the overall control parameter becomes dependent on the spatial pattern of environmental heterogeneity. If the environmental parameter is randomly distributed in space, the overall response tends to remain surprisingly catastrophic, and hysteresis is hardly reduced as compared to the homogeneous case. By contrast, in a smooth environmental gradient, the response of the overall system is gradual, and hysteresis is much smaller. In fact, hysteresis is largely reduced to the initial phases, in which none of the patches have shifted to the alternative state yet. As soon as the first patch shifts, a domino effect occurs, pushing over the neighboring patches. In conclusion, our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity may weaken the tendency for large-scale catastrophic regime shifts if dispersion is unimportant or if local environmental characteristics vary along a smooth gradient.},

We first show why from the universal phenomenon of critical slowing down, spatial correlation should be expected to increase in the vicinity of bifurcations. Subsequently, we explore the applicability of this idea in spatially explicit ecosystem models that can have alternative attractors. The analysis reveals that as a control parameter slowly pushes the system towards the threshold, spatial correlation between neighboring cells tends to increase well before the transition. We show that such increase in spatial correlation represents a better early-warning signal than indicators derived from time-series provided that there is sufficient spatial heterogeneity and connectivity in the system.},

	abstract = {Because novel ecological conditions can cause severe and long-lasting environmental damage with large economic costs, ecologists must identify possible environmental regime shifts and pro-actively guide ecosystem management. As an illustrative example, we applied six potential indicators of impending regime shifts to S. R. Carpenter and W. A. Brock's model of lake eutrophication and analyzed whether or not they afforded adequate advance warning to enable preventative interventions. Our initial analyses suggest that an indicator based on the high-frequency signal in the spectral density of the time-series provides the best advance warning of a regime shift, even when only incomplete information about underlying system drivers and processes is available. In light of this result, we explored two key factors associated with using indicators to prevent regime shifts. The first key factor is the amount of inertia in the system; i.e., how fast the system will react to a change in management, given that a manager can actually control relevant system drivers. If rapid, intensive management is possible, our analyses suggest that an indicator must provide at least 20 years advance warning to reduce the probability of a regime shift to {\textless} 5\%. As time to intervention is increased or intensity of intervention is decreased, the necessary amount of advance warning required to avoid a regime shift increases exponentially. The second key factor concerns the amount and type of variability intrinsic to the system, and the impact of this variability on the power of an indicator. Indicators are considered powerful if they detect an impending regime shift with adequate lead time for effective management intervention, but not so far in advance that interventions are too costly or unnecessary. Intrinsic "noise" in the system obscures the "signal" provided by all indicators, and therefore, the power of the indicators declines rapidly with increasing within- and between-year variability in measurable variables or parameters. Our results highlight the key role of human decisions in managing ecosystems and the importance of pro-active application of the precautionary principle to avoid regime shifts.},

Since the first papers on the subject appeared, two perspectives have developed to describe how communities shift from one stable state to another. One assumes a constant environment with shifts in variables such as population density, and the other anticipates changes to underlying parameters or environmental “drivers”. We review the theory behind alternative stable states and examine to what extent these perspectives are the same, and in what ways they differ. We discuss the concepts of resilience and hysteresis, and the role of stochasticity within the two formulations. In spite of differences in the two perspectives, the same type of experimental evidence is required to demonstrate the existence of alternative stable states.},

This frequently leads to roughly equal importance of deterministic and stochastic forces. The resulting tension between noise and determinism makes ecological dynamics unique, with conceptual and methodological challenges distinctive from those in other dynamical systems. The theory for stochastic, nonlinear ecological dynamics has been developed alongside methods to test models. A range of dynamical components has been considered—density dependence, environmental and demographic stochasticity, and climatic forcing—as well as their often complex interactions. We discuss recent advances in understanding ecological dynamics and testing theory using long-term data and review how dynamical forces interact to generate some central field and laboratory time series.},

	abstract = {Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in the central and western Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands, and Bering Sea have declined by 80\% in the last 30 yr. One hypothesis for the decline in this western Steller sea lion population is that a climate regime shift in 1976–1977 changed the species composition of the fish community and reduced the nutritional quality (energy density) of the sea lion prey field. This in turn led to nutritional stress and reduced individual fitness, survival, and reproduction of sea lions. Implications of this regime shift-“junk food” hypothesis are that (1) the recruitment and abundance of supposed high quality species (e.g., Pacific herring, Clupea pallasi) decreased while those of supposed low quality (e.g., species in the family Gadidae) increased following the regime shift, (2) Steller sea lion diets shifted in response to this change in fish community structure, and (3) a diet composed principally of gadids (e.g., walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma) is detrimental to sea lion fitness and survival. We examine data relating to each of these implications and find little support for the hypothesis that increases in the availability and consumption of gadids following the regime shift are primarily responsible for the decline of the western population of Steller sea lion.},

FI was developed as a measure of information content in data, and it has been adapted to assess order in complex system behaviour. The main advantage of the approach is the ability to collapse multiple variables into an index that can be used to assess stability and track overall trends in a system, including its regimes and regime shifts. Here, we provide a brief overview of FI theory, followed by a simple step-by-step numerical example on how to compute FI. Furthermore, we introduce an open source Python library that can be freely downloaded from GitHub and we use it in a simple case study to evaluate the evolution of FI for the global-mean temperature from 1880 to 2015.

	abstract = {We used an observed abrupt shift in the dominance pattern of two coexisting copepod species in Müggelsee, a shallow eutrophic lake in Germany, to investigate mechanisms leading to this shift, by embedding our findings into the framework of intraguild predation theory and theoretical scenarios of threshold-driven regime shifts. We proposed that the abrupt increase in Cyclops kolensis, changing its status from a rare to the dominant species as available algal prey declined in the lake, was due to its superior exploitative competition for commonly consumed algal prey. However, C. kolensis was only able to thrive in the emerging low food niche when abundances of competing larger Cyclops vicinus, a predator of C. kolensis juveniles, fell below a critical threshold. This is consistent with the “state threshold scenario” of regime shift theory, for which a response variable exhibits an abrupt shift, here C. kolensis, after the driver (C. vicinus) crosses a threshold. We confirmed the nonlinear relationship between the two copepod species by excluding potentially matching abrupt changes in other abiotic and biotic driving variables, and successfully classifying C. kolensis abundance probability on the basis of C. vicinus abundances using logistic generalized linear modeling. C. vicinus decline followed the “driver threshold scenario” of regime shift theory, whereby an abrupt change in a driver (cryptophytes) causes a sudden shift in a response variable (C. vicinus). We illustrated how observational data on plankton communities match predictions derived from ecological theory.},

However, slow responses by ecosystems after transgressing a dangerous threshold also affords borrowed time – a window of opportunity to return to safer conditions before the new state eventually locks in and equilibrates. In this context, the most important challenge is a social one: convincing enough people to confront business-as-usual before time runs out to reverse unwanted regime shifts even after they have already begun.},

	abstract = {Humans and climate affect ecosystems and their services, which may involve continuous and discontinuous transitions from one stable state to another. Discontinuous transitions are abrupt, irreversible and among the most catastrophic changes of ecosystems identified. For terrestrial ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent transitions. Here, we analyse how vegetation patchiness changes in arid ecosystems with different grazing pressures, using both field data and a modelling approach. In the modelling approach, we extrapolated our analysis to even higher grazing pressures to investigate the vegetation patchiness when desertification is imminent. In three arid Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain, Greece and Morocco, we found that the patch-size distribution of the vegetation follows a power law. Using a stochastic cellular automaton model, we show that local positive interactions among plants can explain such power-law distributions. Furthermore, with increasing grazing pressure, the field data revealed consistent deviations from power laws. Increased grazing pressure leads to similar deviations in the model. When grazing was further increased in the model, we found that these deviations always and only occurred close to transition to desert, independent of the type of transition, and regardless of the vegetation cover. Therefore, we propose that patch-size distributions may be a warning signal for the onset of desertification.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem regime shifts are regarded as abrupt global transitions from one stable state to an alternative stable state, induced by slow environmental changes or by global disturbances. Spatially extended ecosystems, however, can also respond to local disturbances by the formation of small domains of the alternative state. Such a response can lead to gradual regime shifts involving front propagation and the coalescence of alternative-state domains. When one of the states is spatially patterned, a multitude of intermediate stable states appears, giving rise to step-like gradual shifts with extended pauses at these states. Using a minimal model, we study gradual state transitions and show that they precede abrupt transitions. We propose indicators to probe gradual regime shifts, and suggest that a combination of abrupt-shift indicators and gradual-shift indicators might be needed to unambiguously identify regime shifts. Our results are particularly relevant to desertification in drylands where transitions to bare soil take place from spotted vegetation, and the degradation process appears to involve step-like events of local vegetation mortality caused by repeated droughts.},

	abstract = {All organisms alter their surroundings, and humans now have the ability to affect environments at increasingly larger temporal and spatial scales. Indeed, mechanical and engineering advances of the twentieth century greatly enhanced the scale of human activities. Among these are the use and redistribution of natural resources. Unfortunately, these activities can have unexpected and unintended consequences. Environmental systems often respond to these activities with diminished or lost capacity of natural function. Fortunately, environmental management can play an important role in ameliorating these negative effects. The aim is to promote sustainable development, i.e., enrichment of the lives of the majority of people without seriously degrading the diversity and richness of the environment. However, the management tools themselves often fall prey to the same narrow levels of perspective that generated the negative conditions. The challenge is to develop a system-level index, one that indicates the organization and direction of ecological system dynamics. This index could detect when the system is changing its configuration to a new, perhaps less desirable, dynamic regime and may be incorporated into a sustainable management plan for the system. In this chapter, we demonstrate the use of Fisher information (FI) as such an environmental system index.},

Modelling studies have suggested that increased variance may foreshadow a regime shift, but this requires long-term data and knowledge of the functional links between key processes. Field-based research and ground-truthing is an essential part of the heuristic that marries theoretical and empirical research, but experimental studies of resilience are lagging behind theory, management and policy requirements. Empirically, ecological resilience must be understood in terms of community dynamics and the potential for small shifts in environmental forcing to break the feedbacks that support resilience. Here, we integrate recent theory and empirical data to identify ways we might define and understand potential thresholds in the resilience of nature, and thus the potential for regime shifts, by focusing on the roles of strong and weak interactions, linkages in meta-communities, and positive feedbacks between these and environmental drivers. The challenge to theoretical and field ecologists is to make the shift from hindsight to a more predictive science that is able to assist in the implementation of ecosystem-based management.},

In this paper, we review the challenges and limitations that are associated with this view, and we discuss promising research paths to explore the causes and the likelihood of abrupt changes in future climate.We focus on several climate system components and ecosystems that have been proposed as candidates for tipping points, with an emphasis on ice sheets, the Atlantic Ocean circulation, vegetation in North Africa and Arctic sea ice. In most example cases, multiple equilibria found in simple models do not appear in complex models or become more difficult to find, while the potential for abrupt change still remains. We also discuss how the low-dimensional logic of current methods to detect and interpret the existence of multiple equilibria can fail in complex models. Moreover, we highlight promising methods to detect abrupt shifts and to obtain information about the mechanisms behind them. These methods include linear approaches such as statistical stability indicators and radiative feedback analysis as well as non-linear approaches to detect dynamical transitions and infer the causality behind events.Given the huge complexity of comprehensive process-based climate models and the non-linearity and regional peculiarities of the processes involved, the uncertainties associated with the possible future occurrence of abrupt shifts are large and not well quantified. We highlight the potential of data mining approaches to tackle this problem and finally discuss how the scientific community can collaborate to make efficient progress in understanding abrupt climate shifts.},

Applying principal component analysis, change-point analysis and a sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts to 72 time series, we confirm that the 1980s regime shift represented a major change in the Earth's biophysical systems from the upper atmosphere to the depths of the ocean and from the Arctic to the Antarctic, and occurred at slightly different times around the world. Using historical climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and statistical modelling of historical temperatures, we then demonstrate that this event was triggered by rapid global warming from anthropogenic plus natural forcing, the latter associated with the recovery from the El Chichón volcanic eruption. The shift in temperature that occurred at this time is hypothesized as the main forcing for a cascade of abrupt environmental changes. Within the context of the last century or more, the 1980s event was unique in terms of its global scope and scale; our observed consequences imply that if unavoidable natural events such as major volcanic eruptions interact with anthropogenic warming unforeseen multiplier effects may occur.},

	abstract = {Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated Cumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD), have been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo experiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the modelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD advantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When tested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same change points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception was the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that appeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values), ICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or tripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended. Interestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the Tropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these series was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other findings of increased climate variability in recent decades.},

	abstract = {Many ecosystems can experience regime shifts: surprising, large and persistent changes in the function and structure of ecosystems. Assessing whether continued global change will lead to further regime shifts, or has the potential to trigger cascading regime shifts has been a central question in global change policy. Addressing this issue has, however, been hampered by the focus of regime shift research on specific cases and types of regime shifts. To systematically assess the global risk of regime shifts we conducted a comparative analysis of 25 generic types of regime shifts across marine, terrestrial and polar systems; identifying their drivers, and impacts on ecosystem services. Our results show that the drivers of regime shifts are diverse and co-occur strongly, which suggests that continued global change can be expected to synchronously increase the risk of multiple regime shifts. Furthermore, many regime shift drivers are related to climate change and food production, whose links to the continued expansion of human activities makes them difficult to limit. Because many regime shifts can amplify the drivers of other regime shifts, continued global change can also be expected to increase the risk of cascading regime shifts. Nevertheless, the variety of scales at which regime shift drivers operate provides opportunities for reducing the risk of many types of regime shifts by addressing local or regional drivers, even in the absence of rapid reduction of global drivers.},

However, the degree to which theoretical EWS predictions are supported in empirical systems remains unclear. The goal of this study is to make recommendations for identifying the types of ecological transitions that are expected to show EWS. We conducted a review and meta-analysis of published studies and comparative analysis of eight northeast Pacific Ocean time series to illustrate the importance of testing for nonlinearity in empirical EWS studies. We found that published studies demonstrating nonlinearity in ecosystem dynamics are more likely to support EWS predictions than studies with linear or undetermined dynamics. The northeast Pacific time series in our analysis were often too short for formal tests of nonlinearity, a common problem in empirical studies. To assess the evidence for nonlinear dynamics in these data, we tested for state-dependent driver–response relationships consistent with hysteresis, a central feature of nonlinear ecological models. This analysis supported the results of the literature meta-analysis. Four time series with driver–response relationships consistent with hysteresis generally supported theoretical EWS predictions, while four without evidence of hysteresis failed to support EWS predictions. Theoretical support for EWS is largely generated from nonlinear models, and we conclude that tests for either nonlinear dynamics or hysteresis are needed before employing EWS.},

Study on the phenomenon and theory of the abrupt climate change is a new research field of modern climatology, and it is of great significance for the prediction of future climate change. The climate regime shift is one of the most common forms of abrupt climate change, which mainly refers to the statistical significant changes on the variable of climate system at one time scale. These detection methods can be roughly divided into five categories based on different types of abrupt changes, namely, abrupt mean value change, abrupt variance change, abrupt frequency change, abrupt probability density change, and the multivariable analysis. The main research progress of abrupt climate change detection methods is reviewed. What is more, some actual applications of those methods in observational data are provided. With the development of nonlinear science, many new methods have been presented for detecting an abrupt dynamic change in recent years, which is useful supplement for the abrupt change detection methods.},

	abstract = {To investigate the underlying mechanisms that control long-term recovery of tundra carbon (C) and nutrients after fire, we employed the Multiple Element Limitation (MEL) model to simulate 200-yr post-fire changes in the biogeochemistry of three sites along a burn severity gradient in response to increases in air temperature, CO2 concentration, nitrogen (N) deposition, and phosphorus (P) weathering rates. The simulations were conducted for severely burned, moderately burned, and unburned arctic tundra. Our simulations indicated that recovery of C balance after fire was mainly determined by the internal redistribution of nutrients among ecosystem components (controlled by air temperature), rather than the supply of nutrients from external sources (e.g., nitrogen deposition and fixation, phosphorus weathering). Increases in air temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration resulted in (1) a net transfer of nutrient from soil organic matter to vegetation and (2) higher C : nutrient ratios in vegetation and soil organic matter. These changes led to gains in vegetation biomass C but net losses in soil organic C stocks. Under a warming climate, nutrients lost in wildfire were difficult to recover because the warming-induced acceleration in nutrient cycles caused further net nutrient loss from the system through leaching. In both burned and unburned tundra, the warming-caused acceleration in nutrient cycles and increases in ecosystem C stocks were eventually constrained by increases in soil C : nutrient ratios, which increased microbial retention of plant-available nutrients in the soil. Accelerated nutrient turnover, loss of C, and increasing soil temperatures will likely result in vegetation changes, which further regulate the long-term biogeochemical succession. Our analysis should help in the assessment of tundra C budgets and of the recovery of biogeochemical function following fire, which is in turn necessary for the maintenance of wildlife habitat and tundra vegetation.},

Detecting an approaching tipping point may help management to adapt to or mitigate the effects of catastrophic change. Intertidal wetlands are one of the most vulnerable ecosystems, faced with climate, sea level and anthropogenic changes. Early warning indicators of regime shifts that may be evident include slowing recovery rates from perturbation, increased autocorrelation and variance, changing skewness and self-organised patchiness. We examine these indicators using intertidal examples and discuss the limitations. Managers cannot adapt to or mitigate the effects of state shifts over tipping points if there is no way to detect early warning signals. This detection is highly dependent on system-specific modelling and requires understanding of alternate stable states theory and its application in large, complex ecosystems.},

We mapped the bifurcation diagram experimentally and found that the populations became more vulnerable to disturbance closer to the tipping point.

Our results suggest that indicators of critical slowing down can provide advance warning of catastrophic thresholds and loss of resilience in a variety of dynamical systems.

However, failure of these early warning signals in some systems calls for a better understanding of their limitations. In particular, little is known about the generality of early warning signals in different deteriorating environments. In this study, we characterized how multiple environmental drivers influence the dynamics of laboratory yeast populations, which was previously shown to display alternative stable states [Dai et al., Science, 2012]. We observed that both the coefficient of variation and autocorrelation increased before population collapse in two slowly deteriorating environments, one with a rising death rate and the other one with decreasing nutrient availability. We compared the performance of early warning signals across multiple environments as “indicators for loss of resilience.” We find that the varying performance is determined by how a system responds to changes in a specific driver, which can be captured by a relation between stability (recovery rate) and resilience (size of the basin of attraction). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the positive correlation between stability and resilience, as the essential assumption of indicators based on critical slowing down, can break down in this system when multiple environmental drivers are changed simultaneously. Our results suggest that the stability–resilience relation needs to be better understood for the application of early warning signals in different scenarios.},

Potential leading indicators include wider swings in dynamics of key ecosystem variables, slower return rates after perturbation and shift of variance towards lower frequencies. We evaluated these indicators using a food web model calibrated to long-term whole-lake experiments. We investigated whether impending regime shifts driven by gradual increase in exploitation of the top predator can create signals that cascade through food webs and be discerned in phytoplankton. Substantial changes in standard deviations, return rates and spectra occurred near the switch point, even two trophic levels removed from the regime shift in fishes. Signals of regime shift can be detected well in advance, if the driver of the regime shift changes much more slowly than the dynamics of key ecosystem variables which can be sampled frequently enough to measure the indicators. However, the regime shift may occur long after the driver has passed the critical point, because of very slow transient dynamics near the critical point. Thus, the ecosystem can be poised for regime shift by the time the signal is discernible. Field tests are needed to evaluate these indicators.},

	abstract = {Long term macrobenthos data together with physical habitat parameters were analysed to investigate spatial and temporal changes at an estuary under different anthropogenic pressures, mainly increasing shellfish farming. The aim was to assess the possible impacts of these pressures on the macrobenthic communities by comparing a period before and after changes in these pressures. Benthic samples were seasonally collected in 1990 (before major anthropogenic changes), 2000 and 2005 at the same sampling stations located on three different habitats in the Eo estuary (Northern Spanish coast). Multivariate and univariate methods were used to assess spatial variability of benthic assemblages and to compare community changes over time. Data from 1990 was assumed as the reference situation to appraise the subsequent impacts. We observed a significant spatial variability of the benthic assemblages in the system as a function of habitat heterogeneity in relation to sediment composition, presence/absence and density of seagrasses, and hydrodynamic regime. Changes were detected in the community composition at all sites during this 15 year period. The extent of changes was related to initial community conditions, rather than the intensity of the pressure. The results suggest that the responses of the benthic communities to human induced perturbations occurring in the system are largely dependent on its intrinsic buffer capacity, and that these communities have been able to cope with an increasing environmental stress (organic enrichment). In conclusion, to keep shellfish farming at a sustainable level without undesirable impacts, the disturbance intensity must be kept below the system carrying capacity. This will allow natural communities to cope with pressures and thus avoid further deterioration in ecological quality. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We standardized abundance data for each of 77 ichthyoplankton taxa, and used the Bray-Curtis distance measure and Flexible Beta linkage method, which grouped them into 22 discrete clusters. Variance Partitioning Analysis stressed the importance of geographical and seasonal processes for ichthyoplankton dynamics, and helped us identify the specific region(s) and month(s) for each response variable (cluster abundance, diversity) in which annual variation was maximized. Response variables were linked to environmental explanatory variables (atmospheric pressure, temperature, salinity and circulation indices) by Canonical Correspondence Analysis. The North Pacific Index (atmospheric pressure) and meso-scale climate variables like the El Ni (n) over tildeo Index (temperature), wind, and freshwater input (circulation) had the strongest impacts on ichthyoplankton species clusters. Specifically, the El Ni (n) over tildeo Index was negatively correlated with several ichthyoplankton clusters that were dominated by cold water species. Circulation was predominantly positively related to diversity and ichthyoplankton clusters, with the exception of clusters that mainly consisted of offshore taxa. The immediate response of ichthyoplankton to environmental forcing might make them suitable ecological indicators of environmental change although additional work is needed to assess affects on survival and recruitment.

	abstract = {The management of marine fisheries needs to undergo dramatic change in the new millennium, in response to the well-documented evidence of global overfishing and the general depletion of commercial fish stocks. The axioms of sustainable development and equilibrium productivity of wild ecosystems are identified as misleading concepts, which nonetheless underlie current approaches to the management of living marine resources. Current trends in marine fisheries landings worldwide provide little evidence of sustainability of marine resources under current management paradigms, where biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries are usually treated as different disciplines. While open-access conditions are less widespread than formerly, except for many straddling and highly migratory resources, fishers usually have access to the resource year-round throughout its range. Despite quotas, the nominal control of capacity and technical measures protecting juveniles, top-down management has generally been unable to prevent stock depletion, particularly of the older spawners that for demersal stocks often support recruitment. An integrated solution to the complexity of managing wild resources seems not to have been achieved. Any new paradigm should assert the basic unpredictability of fisheries at the system level and require a broader range of performance indicators to be incorporated into the decisional framework. This must reflect the non-equilibrium nature of marine systems, and give greater importance to resource (as opposed to harvest) continuity in the face of regime shifts, and promote habitat restoration and conservation of genetic resources. The new management framework requires co-management and collective decision-making to be incorporated within a precautionary and pre-negotiated management framework. This must explicitly recognize that decision-making occurs in conditions of model-based uncertainty and precautionary approaches should be incorporated at all levels, not least of which is to avoid the assumption that all resources can be harvested in a sustainable fashion through time. Redundancy in data inputs to management are needed to avoid the surprises that model-based sampling occasionally leads to, for example, when regime changes reduce productivity in response to climatic fluctuations. Emergency frameworks imposing non-discretionary rules must be invoked when overfishing and/or regime change trigger reference points indicating stock depletion. Non-discretionary recovery plans should then override rights-based systems and persist until fish populations recover to pre-established healthy levels, which may in turn need to await the return of a favourable regime. In fact, some stocks may require periodic rebuilding after regime-induced collapses or because of a combination of ecological or economic impacts, hence a constant harvest policy may not always be possible. It will probably also be necessary to discard the axiom that a stock should be available to harvesting throughout its range and seasonal cycle. Technological advances mean that time- and area-specific access rights are now practical options, through satellite monitoring of vessel operations, even offshore. More fundamentally, the basic axiom of 'enlightened self interest' underlying current methods of management will need to be tempered by an increased ethical concern for the fragility of natural ecosystems.},

Abstract
Predicting regime shifts – drastic changes in dynamic behaviour – is a key challenge in ecology and other fields. Here we show that the class of ecological systems that will exhibit leading indicators of regime shifts is limited, and that there is a set of ecological models and, therefore, also likely to be a class of natural systems for which there will be no forewarning of a regime change. We first describe how nonlinearities in combination with environmental variability lead to model descriptions that will not have smooth potentials, concluding that many ecological systems are described by systems without smooth potentials and thus will not show typical leading indicators of regime shifts. We then illustrate the impact of these general arguments by numerically examining the dynamics of several model ecological systems under slowly changing conditions. Our results offer a cautionary note about the generality of forecasting sudden changes in ecosystems.},

Many such indices have been proposed and here we investigate two: exergy and Fisher Information. Exergy, a thermodynamically based index, is a measure of the maximum amount of useable work that can be extracted when a system is brought into equilibrium with a reference state. The measure for exergy used herein, also includes a factor to weigh the “complexity” of the ecological species. Fisher Information is an old statistical measure that has recently been applied as a way to detect change in system regime and as a measure of system order. These two indices are compared on a 10-compartment food web model undergoing five different perturbation scenarios. This food web model, although simple, allows for some interesting insight into the two indices. The results show that generally, although not always, exergy and Fisher Information respond differently, such that when one increases due to a perturbation the other decreases and vice versa. We provide a discussion as to the usefulness of these metrics as ecological indices and as their potential use as ecological goal functions in light of these findings.},

However, a seemingly abrupt transition can be the product of a system reorganization that has been ongoing much longer than is evident in statistical analysis of a single component of the system. Using both univariate and multivariate statistical methods, we tested a long-term high-resolution paleoecological dataset with a known change in species assemblage for a regime shift. Analysis of this dataset with Fisher Information and multivariate time series modeling showed that there was a∼2000 year period of instability prior to the regime shift. This period of instability and the subsequent regime shift coincide with regional climate change, indicating that the system is undergoing extrinsic forcing. Paleoecological records offer a unique opportunity to test tools for the detection of thresholds and stable-states, and thus to examine the long-term stability of ecosystems over periods of multiple millennia.},

So far, alternative stable states have been addressed from two different angles: community assembly studies, which focus on species and their interactions, and regime shift studies, which focus on changes in ecosystem states following environmental change. Here, we propose a synthetic perspective that merges the community assembly with the regime shift approach to effectively inform restoration of ecosystems exhibiting alternative stable states. We show that the community assembly and the regime shift approaches have emphasized different aspects of alternative stable states (i.e., coarse vs fine resolutions of the focal state variable, different sets of feedback mechanisms, and small vs large spatial scales), and consequently have different limitations that influence restoration strategies. Using a simple mathematical model, we illustrate that a more explicit consideration of species identity and composition (i.e., the community assembly approach) can improve our ability to understand regime shifts and restore degraded ecosystems. Finally, we highlight two case studies in which such merging can bring novel insights into alternative stable states and ecological restoration. Understanding the relevant aspects of community assembly (biotic interactions and species identity) will lead to more informed decisions that target future restoration and the prediction of regime shifts in response to global environmental change.},

	abstract = {Abstract The term tipping point has experienced explosive popularity across multiple disciplines over the last decade. Research on social-ecological systems (SES) has contributed to the growth and diversity of the term’s use. The diverse uses of the term obscure potential differences between tipping behavior in natural and social systems, and issues of causality across natural and social system components in SES. This paper aims to create the foundation for a discussion within the SES research community about the appropriate use of the term tipping point, especially the relatively novel term ‘social tipping point.’ We review existing literature on tipping points and similar concepts (e.g., regime shifts, critical transitions) across all spheres of science published between 1960 and 2016 with a special focus on a recent and still small body of work on social tipping points. We combine quantitative and qualitative analyses in a bibliometric approach, rooted in an expert elicitation process. We find that the term tipping point became popular after the year 2000 – long after the terms regime shift and critical transition - across all spheres of science. We identify 23 distinct features of tipping point definitions and their prevalence across disciplines, but find no clear taxonomy of discipline-specific definitions. Building on the most frequently used features, we propose definitions for tipping points in general and social tipping points in SES in particular.},

To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we systematically review evidence for ecosystem collapses reported in two contrasting biomes – marine pelagic ecosystems and terrestrial forests. Most studies define states of ecosystem collapse quantitatively, but few studies adequately describe initial ecosystem states or ecological transitions leading to collapse. On the basis of our review, we offer four recommendations for defining ecosystem collapse in risk assessments: (1) qualitatively defining initial and collapsed states, (2) describing collapse and recovery transitions, (3) identifying and selecting indicators of collapse, and (4) setting quantitative collapse thresholds.},

Recent research has documented cases of regime shifts in local and regional systems and there is mounting concern about regime shifts of global significance. In this paper we discuss management of social–ecological systems in light of the potential for regime shift. Management that increases system resilience and lowers the probability of regime shifts is beneficial when regime shifts are likely to reduce human well-being. It may not always be possible to avoid harmful regime shifts, so building capacity to adapt should a regime shift occur is beneficial too. Adaptive management can help reduce uncertainty about the likelihood of regime shifts, how this likelihood can be affected by management action, and the impact of regime shifts on well-being. Linking scientific understanding with decision-making is important but distributional consequences can impede decision making and action.},

	abstract = {In the vicinity of tipping points—or more precisely bifurcation points—ecosystems recover slowly from small perturbations. Such slowness may be interpreted as a sign of low resilience in the sense that the ecosystem could easily be tipped through a critical transition into a contrasting state. Indicators of this phenomenon of ‘critical slowing down (CSD)’ include a rise in temporal correlation and variance. Such indicators of CSD can provide an early warning signal of a nearby tipping point. Or, they may offer a possibility to rank reefs, lakes or other ecosystems according to their resilience. The fact that CSD may happen across a wide range of complex ecosystems close to tipping points implies a powerful generality. However, indicators of CSD are not manifested in all cases where regime shifts occur. This is because not all regime shifts are associated with tipping points. Here, we review the exploding literature about this issue to provide guidance on what to expect and what not to expect when it comes to the CSD-based early warning signals for critical transitions.},

	abstract = {The discussions in the Villefranche Workshop covered a wide range of issues. The term regime shift was originally confined to spatial or temporal correspondences between climatic indices and population abundance. The body of evidence for physical–biological coupling has certainly generated a much better appreciation of the natural decadal scale variability in marine systems. It is difficult, however, to deduce from these time series, the mechanisms or trophic pathways that produce the correspondence. Ideally, we would need experimental manipulations such as those used in small lakes, to unravel the causal connections. Since this is impossible in the open sea, we must use comparisons between systems subject to different types of perturbation or stress. We focused at the Workshop on the effects of over-fishing in different marine regimes. The consequences of large scale changes in community structure imposed by excessive fishing give valuable case studies. Coral reefs, rocky shores, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems provide other examples. The possible existence of similar processes across such diverse systems raises corresponding questions about common ecological principles. The adaptive benefits of maximizing resilience (defined as minimizing the largest eigenvalue of the perturbed system) were considered. The corollary of this assumption is that, at the limits of adaptation, there will be switching between communities, providing a potential ground for a broad definition of regime shifts.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems were among the first to provide potential examples of multiple stable states. However, remarkably few of these have been explored in detail, and none have been rigorously confirmed. This may be because differences between alternative states are too subtle to document in the context of regular disturbance, because one state is naturally far more likely to occur than any other, or because most environments naturally support only one type of stable community. It is also possible that the temporal and spatial criteria required to document alternate stable states rigorously may be too difficult to meet in most circumstances. Nevertheless, the possibility of alternative stable states has recently received renewed attention in the context of marine conservation biology. People may be widening the range of habitats in which alternate stable states are possible, or they may be shifting communities to new domains of attraction that rarely occur in the absence of massive anthropogenic perturbations. The ability of people now to alter ocean ecosystems on global scales may eliminate “edge effects” that might otherwise rescue perturbed communities. Ecosystems with alternate stable states are characterized by positive feedback mechanisms that stabilize transitions; even if return to original conditions is predicted (that is, the alternate states are not stable), the same mechanisms will retard recovery. This may explain in part why return to original conditions following anthropogenic disturbance is slower than expected. Slow recovery times and transitions to new states are both potentially costly to human societies. Thus, from a conservation perspective the indefinite persistence of an alternate state may be less important than the presence of feedback loops that slow recovery. Both possibilities reinforce the arguments for application of the precautionary principle in managing marine ecosystems.},

We induced a cyanobacteria bloom by adding nutrients to an experimental lake and mapped fine-resolution spatial patterning of cyanobacteria using a mobile sensor platform. Prior to the bloom, we detected theoretically predicted spatial EWIs based on variance and spatial autocorrelation, as well as a new index based on the extreme values. Changes in EWIs were not discernible in an unenriched reference lake. Despite the fluid environment of a lake where spatial heterogeneity driven by biological processes may be overwhelmed by physical mixing, spatial EWIs detected an approaching bloom suggesting the utility of spatial metrics for signaling ecological thresholds.},

	abstract = {Aims
Over the last decades, Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) end-points have become an important outcome of the randomised controlled trials (RCTs). HRQoL methodology in RCTs has improved following international consensus recommendations. However, no international recommendations exist concerning the statistical analysis of such data. The aim of our study was to identify and characterise the quality of the statistical methods commonly used for analysing HRQoL data in cancer RCTs.
Methods
Building on our recently published systematic review, we analysed a total of 33 published RCTs studying the HRQoL methods reported in RCTs since 1991. We focussed on the ability of the methods to deal with the three major problems commonly encountered when analysing HRQoL data: their multidimensional and longitudinal structure and the commonly high rate of missing data.
Results
All studies reported HRQoL being assessed repeatedly over time for a period ranging from 2 to 36 months. Missing data were common, with compliance rates ranging from 45\% to 90\%. From the 33 studies considered, 12 different statistical methods were identified. Twenty-nine studies analysed each of the questionnaire sub-dimensions without type I error adjustment. Thirteen studies repeated the HRQoL analysis at each assessment time again without type I error adjustment. Only 8 studies used methods suitable for repeated measurements.
Conclusion
Our findings show a lack of consistency in statistical methods for analysing HRQoL data. Problems related to multiple comparisons were rarely considered leading to a high risk of false positive results. It is therefore critical that international recommendations for improving such statistical practices are developed.},

Establishing whether these constitute shifts between alternative stable states is of key importance for the prospects of ecosystem recovery and for management. We show how mechanisms underlying alternative stable states caused by predator–prey interactions can be revealed in field data, using analyses guided by theory on size-structured community dynamics. This is done by combining data on individual performance (such as growth and fecundity) with information on population size and prey availability. We use Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and their prey in the Baltic Sea as an example to discuss and distinguish two types of mechanisms, ‘cultivation-depensation’ and ‘overcompensation’, that can cause alternative stable states preventing the recovery of overexploited piscivorous fish populations. Importantly, the type of mechanism can be inferred already from changes in the predators' body growth in different life stages. Our approach can thus be readily applied to monitored stocks of piscivorous fish species, for which this information often can be assembled. Using this tool can help resolve the causes of catastrophic collapses in marine predatory–prey systems and guide fisheries managers on how to successfully restore collapsed piscivorous fish stocks.},

This paper proposes a theory showing that some ACSs originate from the interaction between climate-induced environmental changes and the species ecological niche. The theory predicts that a substantial stepwise shift in the thermal regime of a marine ecosystem leads indubitably to an ACS and explains why some species do not change during the phenomenon. It also explicates why the timing of ACSs may differ or why some studies may detect or not detect a shift in the same ecosystem, independently of the statistical method of detection and simply because they focus on different species or taxonomic groups. The present theory offers a way to predict future climate-induced community shifts and their potential associated trophic cascades and amplifications.},

	abstract = {The identification and detection of regime shifts pose many challenges. While there is general agreement that a regime shift consists of a restructuring of a marine ecosystem, the form of restructuring that constitutes a regime shift remains under debate. At present, we identify regime shifts through exploratory data analysis but what types of data are appropriate and how should the data be treated. There are many different possible variables to consider in describing a marine ecosystem. There are even many different categories of variables: physical, biogeochemical, habitat, and organismal (from bacteria and plankton through zooplankton to fish). It is possible to consider hundreds or indeed thousands of variables for a given marine ecosystem. Given the complexity of regime shifts, and the potential for misidentification, the selection of the data, and the approach taken to the analysis are important. The results of the analysis of very complex data sets can be quite sensitive to the approach taken to the analysis.
The first step in the analysis is a consideration of what we are looking for. In analyzing data for patterns, we need to know the characteristics of the pattern for which we are searching. With a template in hand, we can then consider the different approaches available for pattern extraction from the data. Since a regime shift is rarely identified through a single variable or time series, a common strategy is to bring together many different time series including both physical and biological data. The typical first step in the analysis is normalization of the data followed by some form of data summation or integration to reduce noise in order that the desired signal is more apparent. Most of the techniques are numerically quite straightforward, although some can be computationally demanding. While there is no unambiguous technique at present, the application of available techniques has been useful in improving our understanding of ocean regime states and shifts. No pure statistical analysis can replace our understanding of the underlying dynamical relations of the various variables, which can be enhanced by explicit dynamic modeling.},

In this work, we consider one-dimensional dynamical systems where attractors are stable equilibrium points.

We test the algorithm on synthetic data from a one-dimensional dynamical system with a multitude of stable equilibrium points and also on a model of the population dynamics of spruce budworms in a forest. The algorithm and other ideas discussed here contribute to an important part of the literature on exercising greater control over the sometimes unpredictable nature of nonlinear systems.},

	abstract = {Theory suggests that ecological systems exhibit a pronounced slow down in their dynamics, known as ‘critical slowing down’ (CSD), before they undergo regime shifts or critical transitions. As a result of CSD, ecosystems exhibit characteristic temporal and spatial changes which can be used as early warning signals of imminent regime shifts. For temporal data, statistical methods to detect these generic indicators of ecosystem resilience are well developed. However, for spatial data, despite a well developed theoretical framework, statistical methods such as data pre-processing and null models to detect EWS are relatively poorly developed. In this manuscript, we investigate the case of a common type of ecological spatial dataset which consists of binary values at each location (e.g. occupied/unoccupied, tree/grass or coralline/bleached). We employ a cellular-automaton based spatially-explicit model which generates data that mimics remotely sensed or field collected high-resolution spatial data with a binary classification of the state variables at each location. We demonstrate that trends in two spatial metrics, spatial variance and spatial skewness, of such binary spatial data lead to false, failed or misleading signals of transitions. We find that, two other indicators, spatial autocorrelation at lag-1 and spectral density ratio, accurately reflect CSD even with binary spatial data. To overcome the problems associated with detection of EWS using spatial variance and skewness, we investigate a data pre-processing method called ‘coarse-graining’ which is inspired from the physics literature on phase transitions. Coarse-graining reduces the spatial resolution of data by averaging state variables over small scales. Yet, it enables detection of CSD-based spatial indicators of impending critical transitions. In summary, our study provides a theoretical basis, and rigorous evaluation, of coarse-graining as a pre-processing step to analyse spatial datasets with discrete state classifications.},

	abstract = {The realization that complex systems such as ecological communities can collapse or shift regimes suddenly and without rapid external forcing poses a serious challenge to our understanding and management of the natural world. The potential to identify early warning signals that would allow researchers and managers to predict such events before they happen has therefore been an invaluable discovery that offers a way forward in spite of such seemingly unpredictable behavior. Research into early warning signals has demonstrated that it is possible to define and detect such early warning signals in advance of a transition in certain contexts. Here, we describe the pattern emerging as research continues to explore just how far we can generalize these results. A core of examples emerges that shares three properties: the phenomenon of rapid regime shifts, a pattern of "critical slowing down" that can be used to detect the approaching shift, and a mechanism of bifurcation driving the sudden change. As research has expanded beyond these core examples, it is becoming clear that not all systems that show regime shifts exhibit critical slowing down, or vice versa. Even when systems exhibit critical slowing down, statistical detection is a challenge. We review the literature that explores these edge cases and highlight the need for (a) new early warning behaviors that can be used in cases where rapid shifts do not exhibit critical slowing down; (b) the development of methods to identify which behavior might be an appropriate signal when encountering a novel system, bearing in mind that a positive indication for some systems is a negative indication in others; and (c) statistical methods that can distinguish between signatures of early warning behaviors and noise.},

However, the empirical validation of these indicators lag behind their theoretical developments. Here, we summarize a range of currently available spatial early warning signals, suggest potential null models to interpret their trends, and apply them to three simulated spatial data sets of systems undergoing an abrupt transition. In addition to providing a step-by-step methodology for applying these signals to spatial data sets, we propose a statistical toolbox that may be used to help detect approaching transitions in a wide range of spatial data.

Recent work has provided a proof-of-principle that many systems approaching a catastrophic transition may be identified through the lens of early warning indicators such as rising variance or increased return times. Despite widespread appreciation of the difficulties and uncertainty involved in such forecasts, proposed methods hardly ever characterize their expected error rates. Without the benefits of replicates, controls or hindsight, applications of these approaches must quantify how reliable different indicators are in avoiding false alarms, and how sensitive they are to missing subtle warning signs. We propose a model-based approach to quantify this trade-off between reliability and sensitivity and allow comparisons between different indicators. We show these error rates can be quite severe for common indicators even under favourable assumptions, and also illustrate how a model-based indicator can improve this performance. We demonstrate how the performance of an early warning indicator varies in different datasets, and suggest that uncertainty quantification become a more central part of early warning predictions.},

	abstract = {1. Human activities have led to ecological regime shifts, first revealed at the community level in ecosystems. A regime shift in a biological community is a sudden change in the relative contributions of several taxa, resulting in a post-shift state that remains stable over the long term with a structure that is outside the boundaries of the ‘normal’ pre-shift variability. Most methods for regime shift detection are based on univariate statistics (e.g. commercial fish catch data, sea surface temperature anomalies). Multivariate methods suitable for identifying change in multi-species communities can be used to identify regime shifts in communities. 2. In this paper, I use a 37-year record (1972–2008) of phytoplankton in the Bay of Quinte (northeastern Lake Ontario) to demonstrate the use of several largely independent data analysis methods that are shown here to concur in their output. Among the most powerful procedures is an approach that models the anomalies around long-term Grand Mean and reference-point community structures that were compared to annual structures using Bray–Curtis community similarity coefficients. CUSUM plots of model residuals, segmented regression analysis and other tests are all useful to identify the location of break-points in records of anomalies. Follow-up significance testing was performed separately with permutation tests. Improved sensitivity of these techniques when applied to highly seasonal data was demonstrated after extraction of seasonal components as periodic functions. 3. Statistically significant shifts in the Bay of Quinte phytoplankton were detected in the year following an approximate 50\% reduction in point-source phosphorus loading in early 1978 and again immediately after the establishment of invasive dreissenid mussels in the mid-1990s. Associated with this second intervention was an increased representation by species of the potentially toxic Cyanoprokaryote Microcystis, and dramatic declines in some diatom species, with significant implications for human use and food web function. 4. This paper provides a ‘tool box’ of methods (most freely available on the WWW) for those needing to distinguish between true shifts and normal inter-annual variability in biological communities. Ability to measure statistically significant change in communities can lead to enhanced understanding of cause–effect relations and to enhanced capabilities for prediction of change.},

Verifying this diagnosis is important because it implies a radically different view on management options, and on the potential effects of global change on such ecosystems. For instance, it implies that gradual changes in temperature or other factors might have little effect until a threshold is reached at which a large shift occurs that might be difficult to reverse. Strategies to assess whether alternative stable states are present are now converging in fields as disparate as desertification, limnology, oceanography and climatology. Here, we review emerging ways to link theory to observation, and conclude that although, field observations can provide hints of alternative stable states, experiments and models are essential for a good diagnosis.},

	abstract = {The longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forests are important ecosystems in the southeastern USA because of their ecological and economic value. Since European settlement, longleaf pine ecosystems have dramatically declined in extent, to the degree that they are now listed as endangered ecosystems. Its sporadic seed production, which limits the frequency of natural regeneration, is identified as a significant factor in this decline. Previous studies did not characterize the complexity in cone production. Here a method of multiscale entropy is used to analyze long-term data for cone production in longleaf pine forests at six sites across its native range. Our results indicate that there exists a regime shift for cone production at each site. The corresponding time scales of the regime shift are generally 1-9, 10-12, 13-16, and 17-24 yr. Overall patterns for the complexity of cone production with the change of time scale are similar among sites, with exception of the Red Hills (FL). There are high correlations between entropy of cone production and entropy of annual mean air temperature and annual total precipitation at all sites. These results provide new insight into the complexity of cone production of longleaf pine forests with significant management implications.},

	abstract = {The occurrence and causes of abrupt transitions, thresholds, or regime shifts between ecosystem states are of great concern and the likelihood of such transitions is increasing for many ecological systems. General understanding of abrupt transitions has been advanced by theory, but hindered by the lack of a common, accessible, and data-driven approach to characterizing them. We apply such an approach to 30–60 years of data on environmental drivers, biological responses, and associated evidence from pelagic ocean, coastal benthic, polar marine, and semi-arid grassland ecosystems. Our analyses revealed one case in which the response (krill abundance) linearly tracked abrupt changes in the driver (Pacific Decadal Oscillation), but abrupt transitions detected in the three other cases (sea cucumber abundance, penguin abundance, and black grama grass production) exhibited hysteretic relationships with drivers (wave intensity, sea-ice duration, and amounts of monsoonal rainfall, respectively) through a variety of response mechanisms. The use of a common approach across these case studies illustrates that: the utility of leading indicators is often limited and can depend on the abruptness of a transition relative to the lifespan of responsive organisms and observation intervals; information on spatiotemporal context is useful for comparing transitions; and ancillary information from associated experiments and observations aids interpretation of response-driver relationships. The understanding of abrupt transitions offered by this approach provides information that can be used to manage state changes and underscores the utility of long-term observations in multiple sentinel sites across a variety of ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Regime shifts are often used to describe sharp changes between two or more ecological states, each characterized by their own dynamics, stochastic fluctuations, or cycles. Ecological theory indicates they can occur either as a result of an abrupt environmental forcing (extrinsic regime shift), or be indicative of complex responses to local-scale dynamics and thresholds (intrinsic regime shift). One important area of ecological research is to develop quantitative tools to analyze regime shifts, but there are few studies that have applied these methods to the long-term ecological record. In this study, we introduce a framework to investigate regime shifts in diatom assemblages and mangrove ecosystem dynamics in a coastal lagoon from the Galápagos Islands over the past 2600 years. The framework integrates a set of established statistical methodologies for investigating regime shift dynamics in long-term ecological records. We use these methods to (1) identify the presence of regime shifts; (2) test for a series of hypothetical relationships (i.e., linear through to threshold) between ecological response and environment using nonlinear regression; and (3) investigate the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic dynamics in response to environmental perturbations. The transitions in the diatoms closely track the sequence of disturbance, recovery, and habitat shifts that have occurred in the lagoon over the past 2600 years, demonstrating extrinsic responses to environmental forcing. In contrast, the shift from a mangrove- to a microbial mat-dominated system ∼945 cal yr BP provides potential evidence of an intrinsic regime shift. Our framework enables robust interpretations into the underlying dynamics of regime shifts in the paleoecological record and is widely applicable for investigating abrupt ecological changes in a range of systems.},

	abstract = {1. Existing methods for identifying ecological community thresholds are designed for univariate indicators or multivariate dimension-reduction of community structure. Most are insensitive to responses of individual taxa with low occurrence frequencies or highly variable abundances, properties of the vast majority of taxa in community data sets. We introduce Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) to detect changes in taxa distributions along an environmental gradient over space or time, and assess synchrony among taxa change points as evidence for community thresholds. 2. TITAN uses indicator species scores to integrate occurrence, abundance and directionality of taxa responses. It identifies the optimum value of a continuous variable, x, that partitions sample units while maximizing taxon-specific scores. Indicator z scores standardize original scores relative to the mean and SD of permuted samples along x, thereby emphasizing the relative magnitude of change and increasing the contributions of taxa with low occurrence frequencies but high sensitivity to the gradient. TITAN distinguishes negative (z-) and positive (z+) taxa responses and tracks cumulative responses of declining [sum(z-)] and increasing [sum(z+)] taxa in the community. Bootstrapping is used to estimate indicator reliability and purity as well as uncertainty around the location of individual taxa and community change points. 3. Using two simulated data sets, TITAN correctly identified taxon and community thresholds in more than 99\% of 500 unique versions of each simulation. In contrast, multivariate change-point analysis did not distinguish directional taxa responses, resulting in much wider confidence intervals that in one instance failed to capture thresholds in 38\% of the iterations. 4. Retrospective analysis of macroinvertebrate community response to a phosphorus gradient supported previous threshold estimates, although TITAN produced narrower confidence limits and revealed that several taxa declined at lower levels of phosphorus. Re-analysis of macroinvertebrate responses to an urbanization gradient illustrated disparate change points for declining (0.81-3.3\% urban land) and increasing (6.8-26.6\%) taxa, whereas the published threshold estimate (20-30\%) missed the declining-taxa threshold because it could not distinguish their synchronous decline from the gradual increase in ubiquitous taxa. 5. Synthesis and applications. By deconstructing communities to assess synchrony of taxon-specific change points, TITAN provides a sensitive and precise alternative to existing methods for assessing community thresholds. TITAN has tremendous potential to inform conservation of rare or threatened species, develop species sensitivity models, identify reference conditions and to support development of numerical regulatory criteria.},

	abstract = {Massive changes to ecosystems sometimes cross thresholds from which recovery can be difficult, expensive and slow. These thresholds are usually discovered in post hoc analyses long after the event occurred. Anticipating these changes prior to their occurrence could give managers a chance to intervene. Here we present a novel approach for anticipating ecosystem thresholds that combines resilience indicators with Quickest detection of change points. Unlike existing methods, the Quickest detection method is updated every time a data point arrives, and minimizes the time to detect an approaching threshold given the users' tolerance for false alarms. The procedure accurately detected an impending regime shift in an experimentally manipulated ecosystem. An ecosystem model was used to determine if the method can detect an approaching threshold soon enough to prevent a regime shift. When the monitored variable was directly involved in the interaction that caused the regime shift, detection was quick enough to avert collapse. When the monitored variable was only indirectly linked to the critical transition, detection came too late. The procedure is useful for assessing changes in resilience as ecosystems approach thresholds. However some thresholds cannot be detected in time to prevent regime shifts, and surprises will be inevitable in ecosystem management.},

	abstract = {The ‘Anthropocene’ concept provides a conceptual framework that encapsulates the current global situation in which society has an ever-greater dominating influence on Earth System functioning. Simulation models used to understand earth system dynamics provide early warning, scenario analysis and evaluation of environmental management and policies. This paper aims to assess the extent to which current models represent the Anthropocene and suggest ways forward. Current models do not fully reflect the typical characteristics of the Anthropocene, such as societal influences and interactions with natural processes, feedbacks and system dynamics, tele-connections, tipping points, thresholds and regime shifts. Based on an analysis of current model representations of Anthropocene dynamics, we identify ways to enhance the role of modeling tools to better help us understand Anthropocene dynamics and address sustainability issues arising from them. To explore sustainable futures (‘safe and operating spaces’), social processes and anthropogenic drivers of biophysical processes must be incorporated, to allow for a spectrum of potential impacts and responses at different societal levels. In this context, model development can play a major role in reconciling the different epistemologies of the disciplines that need to collaborate to capture changes in the functioning of socio-ecological systems. Feedbacks between system functioning and underlying endogenous drivers should be represented, rather than assuming the drivers to be exogenous to the modelled system or stationary in time and space. While global scale assessments are important, the global scale dynamics need to be connected to local realities and vice versa. The diversity of stakeholders and potential questions requires a diversification of models, avoiding the convergence towards single models that are able to answer a wide range of questions, but without sufficient specificity. The novel concept of the Anthropocene can help to develop innovative model representations and model architectures that are better suited to assist in designing sustainable solutions targeted at the users of the models and model results.},

MIT Press, Cambridge, MA] and others extended the framework of state space models involving independent regime changes to the Markov dependent case. The cost of dealing with state space models with Markov switching is high in computational effort because of the number of the possible paths through the chain. Thus it is necessary to make some approximations in order to obtain a computationally feasible algorithm for estimation. The approximations depend on modified smoothing and filtering recursions that can be easily incorporated into an EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation. To investigate the accuracy of approximations, we develop a new method to obtain more exact solutions, and then compare the two methods. We apply both methods to a simulated series. The result shows that employing the approximation-based algorithm not only provides accurate results but also leads to a significant reduction in the computational costs. We also apply the methods to an influenza mortality series, in which we develop a model that is general enough to include most structural models useful in monitoring changes of regime. The model proposed has the flexibility to deal with a wide range of problems involving possible regime shifts in pattern that may be seen to occur in many biological, medical and epidemiological studies.},

However, the current geometric design criteria do not take into account driving at night. Moreover, studies that propose predictive models of operating speed only consider daytime driving conditions. Method This study compares driver speed behavior during daytime and nighttime driving and models operating speeds and speed differentials, identifying significant factors that influence speed behavior under different lighting conditions. The research was carried out using a driving simulator for a section of an existing two-lane rural road composed of 39 tangent–curve configurations. Speed profiles were recorded for 40 drivers under simulated daytime and nighttime driving conditions. Results New predictive speed models, differentiated for daytime and nighttime driving, are proposed that highlight the effects of different geometric predictors under different visibility conditions. Specifically, predictive models for operating speed on curves identified the inverse of the radius and the deflection angle of the curve as predictors under both driving conditions. For speed differentials based on the 85th percentile for maximum speed reduction (85MSR), we found that the inverse of the approaching tangent length and of the curve radius significantly explained the dependent variable in both cases, with a higher dependence of nighttime 85MSR on the curve geometry than on the tangent length. Tangent length had a significant effect on operating speed for independent tangents only for the daytime model, whereas the inverse of the previous radius was confirmed as a predictor for both visibility conditions. Practical applications This research may influence design considerations for nighttime driving by providing evidence of the effects of nighttime conditions on driver speed choices and road safety.},

	abstract = {The traditional catch-can technique for measuring water depth application under sprinkler irrigation systems has the limitation of being unable to monitor the continuous variation of wind drift and evaporation losses (WDEL) under changing weather conditions. Such information is essential to better manage the agricultural water by improving the global water application uniformity under moving irrigation machines. Three parallel, long, impermeable water collection strips were constructed underneath a stationary linear move irrigation system to address this issue. The sprinkler discharge efficiency (SDE≈1- WDEL) was monitored over 5-min intervals (SDE5min) during Apr-Aug of 2014-on a bare experimental plot. Experiments were conducted on a discrete basis for about 1040h total in order to collect more than 11,600 SDE5min data points. It was found that the SDE5min is very dynamic and can experience abrupt changes up to 16.5\% as a result of sudden changes in wind speed and direction. The maximum and minimum observed SDE5min during the study period were 97.5 and 73.6\%, respectively. The difference between maximum and minimum SDE5min during a day/night cycle was controlled by solar radiation and maximum wind speed. The average hourly SDE (SDEhr) for data collected at predawn, morning, afternoon, and evening were 89.5, 87.7, 86.9 and 88.8\%, respectively. Overall, the daily SDE was mainly controlled by air temperature and varied between 81.8 and 91.8\%, indicating that ∼8–18\% of the daily applied water was lost on average. A multiple linear regression model was developed to help predict the SDEhr as a function of weather parameters. The model indicated wind speed, temperature and relative humidity as the best explanatory variables and predicted the SDEhr with an absolute error just over 4\%. Because the difference between maximum and minimum SDEhr over a full experimental day could be as high as 22\%, this magnitude of error was considered to be acceptable for wind drift and evaporation loss estimation.},

In this paper, the impacts of land-use and climate changes on water and sediment yields in the Huangfuchuan River basin (HFCRB) of the Loess Plateau are investigated by combined usage of statistical tests, hydrological modeling, and land-use maps. The temporal trends and abrupt changes in runoff and sediment loads during 1954–2012 are detected by using non-parametric Mann–Kendall and Pettitt tests. The land-use changes between 1980 and 2005 are determined by using transition matrix analysis, and the effects of land-use and climate changes on water and sediment yields are assessed by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model and four scenarios, respectively. The results show significant decreasing trends in both annual runoff and sediment loads, whereas slightly decreasing and significantly increasing trends are detected for annual precipitation and air temperature, respectively. 1984 is identified as the dividing year of the study period. The land-use changes between 1980 and 2005 show significant effects of the Grain for Green Project in China. Both land-use change and climate change have greater impact on the reduction of sediment yield than that of water. Water and sediment yields in the upstream region show more significant decreases than those in the downstream region under different effects. The results obtained in this study can provide useful information for water resource planning and management as well as soil and water conservation in the Loess Plateau region.},

We fit a stochastic cusp catastrophe model to empirical housing market data for six OECD countries, US, JP, UK, NL, SE and BE. Two different estimation approaches are considered – Cobb׳s method and Euler discretization. The analysis shows that while Cobb׳s approach describes the long-run stationary density better, Euler discretization is more tailored for time series, as it provides better one-step-ahead predictions. Proceeding using the Euler discretization method we discuss the dynamics of housing markets in terms of the multiple equilibria cusp catastrophe model. By considering the long-term interest rate as an exogenous variable we obtain new insights into the policy implications of interest rate levels, in particular concerning the stability of housing markets.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method for detecting abrupt changes in dynamic systems. It is based on statistical information generated by the Extended Kalman Filter and is intended to reveal any drift from the normal behaviour of the process. This method was originally developed for linear systems (Himmeblau, 1978), our contribution consists in extending it to unsteady state nonlinear systems. A failure of chemical origin in a perfectly stirred batch chemical reactor, occurring at an unknown instant, is simulated. The reactor is modelled by mathematical expressions translating the relationships between heat and mass balances applied to the reaction mass. These expressions constitute the model which describes the behaviour of the process under normal conditions. The purpose is to detect the presence of this abrupt change, and pinpoint the moment it occurred. It is also shown that the convergence of the Extended Kalman Filter is accomplished more or less rapidly according to the nature of the noise generated by the measurement sensors. The state estimate is observed and discussed, as well as the delay in detection according to the decision threshold. The reaction under study is an exothermic second order one.},

	abstract = {A simple and versatile strategy was developed for dual detection (colorimetric and fluorimetric) of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) using folic acid (FA) fabricated silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as a probe. The optical properties (surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band and fluorescence) of FA-Ag NPs were strongly influenced by the addition of 6-MP. The abrupt change in absorbance of FA-Ag NPs was observed with increasing concentration of 6-MP, resulting a slight blue-shift in the SPR band and a color change from yellow to colorless, which confirms the oxidation of Ag0 NPs to Ag+ ion. Advantage is taken of the fact that FA is displaced from the surface of the Ag NPs, which progressively enhanced the fluorescence intensity of FA with increasing concentration of 6-MP. The perfect linear variations of absorbance at 399nm and emission peak at 448nm with 6-MP concentration was observed in range of 20•1000 and 5•300nM by UV•vis and fluorescence spectrometric methods, enabling the use of probe as a dual probe for quantification of 6-MP. Moreover, the probe shows excellent anti-disturbance ability when exposed to a series of interfering other organic, inorganic and biomolecules and can be applied to the determination of 6-MP in real samples with the detection limits of 13.2 and 2.3nM by colorimetric and fluorimetric methods, which suggests that the present method has a great potential of application for assay of 6-MP in pharmaceutical and biological samples.},

	abstract = {Abrupt reduction of the sediment load in the middle reaches of the Yellow River has extracted much attention during the past several decades due to global climate changes and intensive human activities. This paper investigates the spatial and temporal variations of annual sediment load in the section between Hekouzhen and Longmen in the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin from 1962 to 2009 by using annual observations at 21 hydrological gauging stations (4 mainstream and 17 tributaries stations), by making use of Mann–Kendall test and simple linear regression for trend detection, and the sequential cluster analysis method and Student’s t test for changing point detection. The results suggest that sediment load from both mainstream and tributaries show significant decreasing trends at confidence level of 0.01. Evident abrupt changing points are detected around 1970s for most stations, but for Toudaoguai station and Fugu station are found in the mid-1980s, which are mainly attributed to the operation of Longyangxia Dam. In addition, abrupt changes in the sediment series at some stations from the tributaries were found around the late 1990s, this situation may be resulted from the “Green for Grain” project launched in 1999. Sediment budget analysis indicates that the 17 tributaries contributes 70.60\% sediment load to the whole research area, which suggests that the majority sediment load contribution to He-Long region is from these tributaries. The comparison among three mainstream sections implies that the sediment is mainly from Wubao–Longmen section. And contribution of tributaries in each mainstream section is mainly from Huangfuchuan River, Kuye River, Wuding River and Yan River. The reduction of the sediment load is mainly caused by human activities especially soil and water conservation projects (such as afforestation, terraces, reservoirs and dams). In summary, the results in this study provide a further evidence for a more exact sediment source region and implementing soil and water conservation measures more effectively in the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin, China.},

This study presents methods to detect and characterise small changes in the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) that deviate from expected behaviour. Generalized additive models (GAMs) are used to describe daily mean NO2 concentrations at roadside monitoring sites to determine how concentrations deviate from measured concentrations. Structural change methods are applied to time series describing this difference to identify change-points, where concentrations of NO2 deviate significantly from expected behaviour. Methods are also used which quantify the timing and uncertainty associated in the timing of these change-points. For most time series data considered in London, concentrations of NO2 underwent relatively abrupt changes rather than smoothly varying increases; changes which remain largely undetected in raw time series data. Most change-points occurred in late 2002 or early 2003, and the factors, which may have contributed to them, are discussed. These methods can also identify technical problems with monitoring equipment and are applicable to other instances where detecting sudden atmospheric composition change is important.},

Here a novel approach based on stochastic approximation learning of probabilistic mixtures is proposed. It assumes that the camera can zoom and move in both horizontal and vertical planes, and it is also adequate for egomotion sequences without abrupt changes. In other words it is a non panoramic model for moving cameras, where the camera movement allows to reuse enough background information from the previous frame. Two pixel models are used, one to follow the camera movement and the other to detect foreground objects. A procedure is developed to transform and interpolate the covariance matrices of the Gaussian mixture components as the camera moves and zooms. Moreover, a background extrapolation method is presented in order to generate new mixture models for previously unseen regions. The proposal is compared with some state-of-the-art alternatives, with competitive results both quantitatively and qualitatively.},

	abstract = {Changes in the magnitude, frequency and timing of heavy precipitation are closely related to the occurrence of floods and droughts, which hold a great deal of significance for management of agricultural irrigation and water resources. Records of daily precipitation and temperature from 728 stations across China were used to assess changes in the magnitude, frequency and timing of heavy precipitation using the Peak-over-Threshold (POT) with 95th percentile as the threshold. Because of the continuous nature of the magnitude and timing of heavy precipitation, the “change point” method and the modified Mann-Kendall trend test method were used to detect change points (CPs) and slowly-varying changes, respectively. In addition, the segmented regression and Poisson regression methods were used to detect CPs and temporal trends in the frequency of heavy precipitation, respectively, with consideration of the count nature of the data. The results showed that 55\% and 36\% of the stations had CPs in mean and/or variance of the magnitude and timing, respectively, while the percentage is only 5.8\% in the frequency. However, while there is limited evidence of significant trends in the magnitude and timing, strong evidence points to a significant increasing frequency in most regions of China. These changes may be partly explained by changes in summer temperature. Examination of the summer surface temperature records suggests that the areas, where the frequency of heavy precipitation has a significant increase, are also mostly characterized by significant increasing temperature. In addition, trends of the frequency vary between the periods before and after the turn point (TP) of summer temperature trends, especially in northern China where both the summer temperature and the frequency have shifted significantly decreasing trends to significantly increasing trends. A possible interpretation of these findings is that storms tend to be more frequent without significant changes in water vapor content.},

Of these techniques, the method based on seismic noise measurements allows abrupt changes in seismic impedance at landslide boundaries resulting from varying levels of seismic velocity and material density to be detected. Peaks of the Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio have proven to serve as effective indicators of the resonance frequency of low-impedance surface layers. In this work, horizontal to vertical spectral ratio surveys of the Castagnola (La Spezia, Italy) and Roccalbegna (Grosseto, Italy) landslides were carried out. From roughly 100 single-station measurements made inside and outside the landslides at each site, we define a threshold number of single-station seismic noise measures beyond which information is redundant because the variation in reconstructed impedance contrast surfaces is not significant. This approach allows one to reliably retrieve the geometry of a landslide body, ultimately generating useful information for determining whether further measurements are needed to improve landslide body reconstruction.},

Certain kinds of disturbance signals do not show distinct abrupt changes in the signal parameters. In those cases, the standard mother wavelets fail to achieve correct event-specific segmentations. A new adjustment technique to the standard Haar wavelet is proposed in this paper, by introducing 2n adjusting zeros in the Haar wavelet scaling filter, n being a positive integer. This technique is quite effective in segmenting those fault signals into pre- and post-fault segments, and it is an improvement over the standard mother wavelets for this application.

Detecting structural breaks in natural processes, however, turns out to be an ambitious task because the lack of well defined target values and reference periods renders application of standard statistical (process or quality) control methods all but impossible. We develop an iterative procedure combining econometric, time series and quantile methods that produce a graphic display referred to as a “shiftogram,” which indicates potential shifts within univariate components of an ecosystem of interest by characterizing their specific and often fairly complex properties. The shiftogram approach can be routinely applied as a scanning device to any (univariate) time series. We provide a search algorithm that iteratively looks for the best value of some quality-of-fit criterion for a time series where the break point is not known beforehand. The approach is demonstrated by the application to univariate examples of fish recruitment, a climate change phenomenon and a canonical variable bundling the effect of different biodiversity indices. Analysis of ecosystem level shifts (i.e. regime shifts) can then be conducted by applying the shiftogram method to multiple component variables and examining correspondence among their resulting shift point and shift types. Alternatively we illustrate how regime shifts can be examined directly by applying the shiftogram approach to multivariate time series data after reduction to a univariate case through canonical data reduction techniques.},

Where humans interact with the landscapes, changing their flammability and acting as fire initiators or suppressors, fire regimes may change. Developing an objective and quantitative method for detecting short-term changes in fire regimes could be of paramount importance for addressing the effectiveness of fire management measures. We used the change point approach to detect shifts in fire frequency and extent in a 100-year fire dataset of two Swiss cantons (Ticino and Valais) differing in environmental, socioeconomic and legal context. We then analyzed the detected changes in fire regimes in the light of the implemented fire policy and the socio-economic evolution. Our results show the suitability of the approach for detecting change points. We found in particular that in the less fire-prone Canton of Valais, major driving forces that yield shifts in fire regimes are of climatic and socio-economic origin, whereas in the fire-prone Canton of Ticino fire policy measures also contributed to detectable changes. Fire legislative measures led to reduced fire frequencies, whereas improvements in fire-fighting resulted in a reduction of burnt area. Policy makers may learn from such analyses for planning future measures.},

	abstract = {Summary Detecting changes in catchment hydrochemistry driven by targeted pollutant mitigation is high on the scientific agenda, following the introduction of the European Union Water Framework Directive. Previous research has shown that understanding natural variability in hydrochemistry time series is vital if changes due to mitigation are to be detected. In order for change to be detected in a statistically robust manner, the data analysis methods need careful consideration. Previous work has shown that erroneous results have often been obtained when statistical analyses have been carried out despite the associated test assumptions not being met. This paper discusses the principal data issues which must be considered when analysing hydrochemical datasets, including non-normality and non-stationarity. A range of statistical techniques is discussed which could be used to detect gradual or abrupt changes in hydrochemistry, including parametric, non-parametric and signal decomposition methods. The statistical power of these techniques as well as their suitability for identifying change is discussed. Using the uniquely detailed hydrochemical datasets generated under the Demonstration Test Catchments programme in England, the efficacy and robustness of change detection methods for hydrochemical data series is assessed. A conceptual framework for choosing a change detection method is proposed, based on this analysis, in order to raise awareness of the types of questions a researcher should consider in order to perform robust statistical analyses, for informing river catchment management and policy support decisions.},

	abstract = {Power system restoration is a complex and vital task, which can be viewed as the repeated reconnection of de-energised elements of the network in blackout to re-energise them. However, the restoration process will be delayed if an excessive standing phase angle difference (SPAD) is detected across lines, and any delay in the restoration increases its economic and social costs. This paper proposes a two-step method for reducing excessive SPAD. In contrast to conventional techniques, this new approach optimally reschedules the machines to reduce the excessive SPAD, whilst avoiding abrupt changes in power output, and uses real-time information that enables operators to perform restoration in real-time. The method is tested using the IEEE 118-bus test system, and the results demonstrate that it can quickly determine a solution that decreases excessive SPADs to values below a user-defined threshold, whilst reducing operational cost and requiring changes in the power output of machines smaller than a given percentage of the nominal power output.},

	abstract = {This note provides a brief review of five analytical methods previously used or promoted for diagnosing regime shifts in marine ecosystems. The methods discussed are: (i) principal components analysis, (ii) compositing average standard deviates, (iii) autoregressive moving average and intervention analysis modeling, (iv) vector autoregressive process modeling, and (v) Fisher information. Assessments of the relative strengths and weaknesses for the different analytical approaches are also offered. Some of these methods are applied to a collection of fishery oceanographic time series for the N. Pacific to illustrate aspects of their relative utility and limitations for diagnosing regime shift behavior. One recommendation for future studies is to analyze biotic and abiotic time series separately in order to identify ecosystem state variables of interest and to better isolate ecosystem behaviors from other influences like environmental change. Methods that allow for quantitative assessments of the statistical significance of hypothesized regime shifts should be favored over those that do not. Analyses of especially large collections of time series may benefit from first using a data compression technique and then applying one of the methods that are more appropriate for just one or a small number of time series. Because of the difficulties in observing and adequately documenting many aspects of marine ecosystem variability, it is crucial that future research attempt to combine empirical studies of large marine ecosystems with theoretical and modeling studies of other systems for which the dynamics and predictability are better understood. With such a comparative approach it should be possible to refine conceptual and simulation models, while also identifying crucial gaps in existing observations.},

	abstract = {Resource sharing is an inherent characteristic of cloud data centers. Virtual Machines (VMs) and/or Containers that are co-located in the same physical server often compete for resources leading to interference. The noisy neighbor’s effect refers to an anomaly caused by a VM/container limiting resources accessed by another one. Our main contribution is an online, lightweight and application-agnostic solution for anomaly detection, that follows an unsupervised approach. It is based on comparing models for different lags: Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Models to characterize the resource usage profile of the application, and distance measures to score the similarity among models. An alarm is raised when there is an abrupt change in short-term lag (i.e. high distance score for short-term models), while the long-term state remains constant. We test the algorithm for different cloud workloads: websites, periodic batch applications, Spark-based applications, and Memcached server. We are able to detect anomalies in the CPU and memory resource usage with up to 82–96\% accuracy (recall) depending on the scenario. Compared to other baseline methods, our approach is able to detect anomalies successfully, while raising low number of false positives, even in the case of applications with unusual normal behavior (e.g. periodic). Experiments show that our proposed algorithm is a lightweight and effective solution to detect noisy neighbor effect without any historical info about the application, that could also be potentially applied to other kind of anomalies.},

In particular, the time series consisting of alternate stationary regimes characterised by the different amplitude and shape of oscillations with fast transient processes between these regimes are considered, with similar transitions being possible due to changes either in the coupling or in the individual properties of subsystems. Two popular approaches to surrogate times series generation are used to check the significance of the method results. Two model structures: the standard linear and the special non-linear adapted to data are implemented. The Granger causality method using the model structure adapted to data is shown to be significantly advantageous in detecting coupling directionality and the instant time of the regime change than the standard linear method, while in some cases the sensitivity and the specificity of the adapted approach are insufficient.},

A feature extraction method, based on a discrete wavelet transform that is combined with an evolving neural network, is used to recognize spatial–temporal patterns of electrical current data. Different wavelet families, such as Haar, Symlet, Daubechie, Coiflet and Biorthogonal, and different decomposition levels, were investigated in order to provide the most discriminative features for fault detection. The use of an evolving neural network was shown to be a quite appropriate approach to fault detection since high impedance faults is a time-varying problem. The performance of the proposed evolving system for detecting and classifying faults was compared with those of well-established computational intelligence methods: multilayer perceptron neural network, probabilistic neural network, and support vector machine. The results showed that the proposed system is efficient and robust to changes. A classification performance in the order of 99\% is exhibited by all classifiers in situations where the fault patterns do not significantly change during tests. However, a performance drop of about 13–24\% is exhibited by non-evolving classifiers when fault patterns suffer from gradual or abrupt change in their behavior. The evolving system is capable, after incremental learning, of maintaining its detection and classification performance even in such situations.},

	abstract = {Summary Because the widely used Bayesian change point analysis (BCPA) is generally applied to the normal distribution, it cannot be freely used to the annual maximum precipitations (AMP) in South Korea. Therefore, this study proposed the fused lasso penalty function to detect the change point of AMP which can be generally fitted by using the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution in South Korea. First, four numerical experiments are conducted to compare the detection performances between BCPA and fused lasso method. As a result, fused lasso shows the superiority of the data generated by GEV distribution having skewness. The fused lasso method is applied to 63 weather stations in South Korea and then 17 stations having any change points from BCPA and the GEV fused lasso are analyzed. Similar to the numerical analyses, the GEV fused lasso method can delicately detect the change point of AMPs. After the change point, the means of AMPs did not go back to the previous. Alternately, BCPA can be stated to find variation points not change points because the means returned to their original values as time progressed. Therefore, it can be concluded that the GEV fused lasso method detects the change points of non-stationary AMPs of South Korea. This study can be extended to more extreme distributions for various meteorological variables.},

The proposed Dependent Dirichlet Process Piecewise Regression Mixture (DDPPRM) model is capable of handling dynamic nature of data by detecting evolving clusters at each time step. This evolution manifests dynamically in three states of clusters: newly created, existing, and transient states of clusters. The model is also able to generate clusters over time infinitely. It is capable of learning the optimal number of clusters rather than using the fixed, predefined clusters. However, other clustering methods such as Fuzzy C-Regression Model and Piecewise Regression Mixture technique support none of those capabilities. The proposed model is also capable of showing regime changes and segmenting functions in regression/time series problems. A two-step Gibbs sampling method is utilized for assigning data to clusters. Expectation-Maximization method is used for finding the optimal values of parameters of functions and probability distributions. The model is validated by using some numerical experiments and calculating three validity indexes as well as Mean Square Error of the model. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other clustering, segmentation, and forecasting models in literature.},

The nature of the changes is analysed based on data collected at twenty-one weather stations and five hydrological stations in the period of 1960–2010. The sequential Mann–Kendall test analysis is used to capture temporal trends and abrupt changes in the five sub-catchments of the Wei River Basin. A non-parametric trend test at the basin scale for annual data shows a decreasing trend of precipitation and runoff over the past fifty-one years. The temperature exhibits an increase trend in the entire period. The potential evaporation was calculated based on the Penman-Monteith equation, presenting an increasing trend of evaporation since 1990. The stations with a significant decreasing trend in annual runoff mainly are located in the west of the Wei River primarily interfered by human activities. Regression analysis indicates that human activity was possibly the main cause of the decline of runoff after 1970.},

Most water bodies had abrupt increasing NDVI changes between 2010 and 2011, caused by the sequential severe flooding and drought in the two years. In contrast, large parts of the surrounding land areas had abrupt decreasing NDVI changes. Large decreasing changes occurred around 2003 at the city of Nanchang, which were driven by urbanization. These results revealed spatial–temporal land cover changing patterns and potential drivers in the wetland ecosystem of Poyang Lake.},

To make the moving window strategy more efficient, the weighted form of the supervised latent factor analysis approach is applied.

The objective of this study was to determine the potential of the modified conductance mill to detect popcorn infested with different developmental stages. Two laboratory milling units were tested that had differing sharpness, which affected the feed-rate through the rolls. One mill averaged 135 s to feed 1 kg of popcorn while the second mill with sharper teeth averaged 100 s to feed 1 kg of popcorn. Four popcorn varieties were evaluated, with their average kernel weight ranging from 12.5 g to 18.5 g per 100 kernels. Known numbers of infested popcorn kernels were added to 1 kg samples of popcorn. The slower feeding mill detected 81\% of the pupae, 91\% of the medium larvae, and 47\% of the small larvae. The faster feeding mill detected 75\% of the pupae, 80\% of the medium larvae, and 43\% of the small larvae.

In addition to it, correlation analysis was also performed. Trend analysis of annual rainfall by different methods indicated similar annual trends in eastern India. North-eastern, south-eastern and western parts of eastern India indicated increasing trend, whereas the north-western, central and southern parts showed decreasing trend. A similar trend was observed by different methods in case of seasonal rainfall. During winter season, decreasing trend was observed in the central part, whereas similar results were obtained for pre-and post-monsoon in the western part. The trend during monsoon season was found similar to annual rainfall trend. Abrupt change in trend of rainfall with time was lacking in eastern India. Maximum temperature analysis indicated increasing trend in the western part for all the seasons (except in monsoon) and decreasing trend in the eastern part. On the contrary, increasing trend was observed in the eastern part and decreasing trend in the western half of the study area for all the seasons in case of minimum temperature. Significant changes were observed during monsoon season as compared to other seasons. A decreasing trend in mean temperature was observed in the central, southern and north western parts, whereas it was found to be increasing in the north-eastern, western and south-eastern parts. In majority of the eastern India region, any abrupt change of trend in temperatures with time was not clearly observed. Negative correlation between rainfall and maximum temperature was observed in the entire eastern India.

	abstract = {Landform attributes derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) are the most commonly used factors to predict soil depths on hillslopes. However, the selection of an appropriate algorithm to calculate terrain attributes and identify an optimal DEM resolution remains ambiguous. In this study, we propose a method to use high-resolution DEM and spatial soil depth data to obtain terrain attributes and identify the optimal DEM resolution to predict soil depths at hillslope scales. A geophysical method (ground penetrating radar, GPR) was used to investigate the reasons for the optimal DEM resolution findings. Point-scale soil depth from 116 sites and elevation data were collected from two adjacent headwater hillslopes (H1: 0.42ha and H2: 0.31ha) at the Hemuqiao hydrological experimental station in Southeast China. The elevation datasets were collected using a total station at a variable spacing level and were then used to derived DEMs at nine spatial resolutions: 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 2.00, 3.50, 5.00, 7.50 and 10.00m. Nine primary and secondary topographic attributes using the nine spatial resolution DEMs were then derived. Two different algorithms (D8 and D∞) for calculating contributing areas and related secondary topographic attributes were compared. We used and compared both linear (multiple linear regression, MLR) and non-linear (artificial neural network, ANN) models for soil depth prediction. Results demonstrated that the two models performed well for predicting soil depth. Specifically, MLR performed better than the non-linear model of ANNs. Additionally, we found that the multiple-direction algorithm (D∞) allowed flow divergence and avoided abrupt changes in soil depth predictions (orphan cells) and should be adopted for model construction. The D∞ algorithm performed better in divergent areas, such as ridges and side slopes, and the D∞ algorithm also worked well in convergent areas, such as valleys. Moreover, our results demonstrated that moderate (e.g., 2.00m) resolution topographic attributes, instead of the finest resolution, achieved the best prediction with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) and the highest values of the coefficient of determination (R2). Moreover, the GPR results indicated that the valley accumulated more soils than side-slope areas, and a sharp increase in soil depth was found in areas adjacent to the valley. Comparing the optimal DEM resolution and valley width obtained by GPR, we found that average valley width (AVW) should be considered a good measure for choosing the optimal DEM resolution for soil depth prediction.},

It is assumed that the tracking is done by a Kalman filter and that the abrupt change takes place after the steady-state behavior of the filter is reached. Result The effect of the additive change on the innovation process is expressed in closed form, and we show that the optimal detection method depends on the available information, contained in the change vector. Method We take a Bayesian perspective and show that prior knowledge on the nature of the change can be used to significantly improve the detection performance. Result Specifically, we show that performance of such a detector coincides with that of a matched filter when the variance (uncertainty) of the change tends to zero, and it coincides with that of an energy detector when the variance tends to infinity. Conclusion Finally we conclude that utilizing the derived closed form improves the detection performance for abrupt changes for Kalman filter based tracking problems. In addition, it is concluded that incorporating prior knowledge can improve the detection performance only if the prior variance is less than a certain amount.},

	abstract = {Abstract Internal surface damage such as wall-thinning and cracks in piping systems are mainly caused by chemical reactions, heat, erosion, solid carrying fluids or a combination of such influences. Early detection of such surface damage is crucial in order to avoid sudden failure and the subsequent downtime losses and safety hazards. In this paper we develop methods for inner damage identification in pipes utilizing the vibration mode shapes. Wall-thinning and cracks are modeled by smooth gradual change and abrupt change in the internal surface of the pipe, respectively. Since wavelets are very efficient in detecting fast changes in signals and their derivatives, they are primarily used to detect crack development. While wavelets cannot be used to detect smooth wall-thinning changes, they can, nevertheless, be used to detect the beginning and end of such damage. We develop a new method for identifying the profile of the inner surface of the pipe, once the wavelet transform indicates that damage is taking place. The identification process requires the shape of one vibration mode of the pipe and does not require the elaborate monitoring and tracking of changes in the modal characteristics. No baseline data are needed aside from the nominal values of the pipe parameters. In addition to damage localization, the developed identification method is capable of quantizing damage severity from the identification of a more accurate profile of the inner surface of the pipe. The motivation and methods used in this work are introduced first in a general setting and then demonstrated by several pipe examples. The numerical simulations carried out here indicate the effectiveness of the developed approach.},

The proposed grid system can detect the key topographic features in the computational domain where high-resolution mesh is in need for reliably solving the shallow water equations. The mesh refinement is automatically carried out in these areas while the mesh in the rest of the domain remains coarse. The criterion determining the refinement is suggested by a dimensionless number with a fixed value of 0.2 after sensitivity analysis. Three laboratory and field-scale test cases are employed to demonstrate the performance of the model for flow simulations on the new non-uniform grids. In all of the tests, the grid system is shown to successfully generate high-resolution mesh only in those areas with abruptly changing topographic features that dominate the flooding processes. To produce numerical solutions of similar accuracy, the non-uniform grid based model is able to accelerate by about two times comparing with the fine uniform grid based counterpart.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, several species have undergone distributional shifts in the southern Benguela. The commercially-important West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii is one of these, and its shift in distribution has had profound effects on the rest of the ecosystem along the south-west coast. Reasons for these shifts are not fully understood, but are probably linked to changes in environmental conditions. We applied a sequential t-test algorithm for analyzing regime shifts (STARS) to physical (wind and upwelling) and biological (rock-lobster catch and growth, Bank Cormorant abundance) data for the southern Benguela inshore region and performed sensitivity tests on each of the variables. Regime shifts were defined as ‘robust’ or ‘possible’ if they were detected for⩾70\% or⩾60\% of the sensitivity tests respectively. To corroborate the shifts detected by STARS, we then applied two additional methods: change point analysis and the Chow breakpoint test. The STARS method outperformed the other two methods because it could handle shorter time series and detect shifts towards the end of the time series, but most of the significant shifts detected by STARS were also detected by one or both of the other methods. A significant shift in Cape Point winter winds occurred in 1983, an El Niño year. However, measurement methodology changed during the same period and this is discussed in relation to the shift. A decline in rock-lobster growth rate occurred in the mid 1980s, and significant increases in upwelling variability and mean summer winds were detected in the early-to-mid 1990s – the same period in which rock lobster abundance underwent an eastward shift, declining on the west coast and increasing on the south-west coast. Bank Cormorants underwent respective declines and increases in the mid-to-late 1990s on the west and south-west coasts following the shift in lobsters. Further shifts in mean wind and upwelling were detected in the 2000s. These results are a step towards developing ecosystem indicators for the region, which can be monitored with the intended use of providing an early warning system for long-term, ecosystem-scale changes.},

	abstract = {Vegetation communities, morphometric and water quality variables were sampled in 62 undisturbed coastal lagoons along a natural land-uplift gradient in the northern Baltic Sea. The lagoons had a morphological inlet threshold reflecting habitat isolation (i.e. the diminished connectedness of the lagoon to the sea) and located in different parts of the archipelago (corresponding to altering wave exposure). We used indirect multivariate methods to find changes in vegetation composition, and axes derived from the analyses were used in correlation and stepwise multiple regression analyses together with environmental variables. Habitat isolation proved to be the strongest predictor for vegetation composition. To identify significant change-points we used a method, which detects regime shifts by accounting for differences in chronological series and gives a regime shift index. Significant shifts in habitat isolation, average depth and total nitrogen were followed by shifts in species variables (i.e. dominant species, cover and species richness) and salinity, total phosphorus and turbidity. Of the species, especially Chara tomentosa showed a shift of high magnitude. Also a shift in wave exposure mirroring position of lagoons in the archipelago structured the species, but this division was seen only for less isolated lagoons. Our results suggest that lagoons are primarily structured by habitat isolation forming two structurally different regimes: one of less isolated lagoons dominated by a diverse array of vascular plants and marine algae of both outer and inner archipelago characters, and one with isolated lagoons dominated by high vegetation cover and dominance of Chara. In addition, vegetation seemed to stabilize water quality in the isolated regime by reducing turbidity and phosphorus, indicating a potential feed-back mechanism and a shift in structuring disturbances from abiotic to biotic factors with habitat isolation.},

Although many indicators have been identified that help classify trends indicating movement toward and away from sustainability, evaluating changes in system behavior requires monitoring multiple variables over time. Therefore, there is great value in methods that can capture the dynamics of multidimensional systems. Fisher information collapses multiple variables into an index that can be monitored over time to assess changes in the dynamic behavior of systems. It has demonstrated promise in capturing dynamic order and detecting regime shifts in model and real systems, but challenges in handling data quality and interpreting results can limit its application.

New Hydrological Insights for the Region The findings of this study indicated that although the streamflow coming from the upper reaches have risen, those flowing to the lower reaches have declined significantly. Analysis of the correlation between climatic factors and streamflow variations and the assessment of the development of socioeconomics revealed that: (1) rising temperature and precipitation are the main cause to explain the increases in streamflow in the upper HRB; and (2) human activities in the middle reaches of the HRB rather than climate changes were primarily responsible for the water shortage and ecological deterioration of the lower HRB.},

Coincident regime shifts were detected in phytoplankton, benthos, and fish in 1995, which was just after invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena spp.) became established in the bay in 1993–1994. Two independent methods were used to detect these shifts: 1) principal components analysis followed by a Regime Shift Detector test for a change point in the running mean of the first principal component scores and (2) measurements of significant difference between pre- and post-Dreissena ecosystem structure based on measures of Bray–Curtis community similarity. Although a statistically significant shift was not detected in the zooplankton community by itself, zooplankton variables were instrumental in the overall ecosystem shift, determined for the combined four communities. All 32 variables were ranked for their individual contribution to the difference between the pre- and post-Dreissena ecosystem structures. The resolution of two distinct ecosystem structures, pre- and post-Dreissena, was greatly improved after employing a novel method of variable optimization that involved a selective and sequential removal of variables contributing least to the statistical difference between pre- and post-Dreissena ecosystem structures.

Recently, conversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural land has been increasing as accelerated by the growth of industrial sector. If this conversion occurs continuously, it will lead to decreasing of the agricultural production in Jombang. Therefore, it is an urgent to provide accurate and up-to-date information of agricultural land use changes.

	abstract = {It is complicated to measure the effects of various economic events on office markets within a non-parameter modeling framework. In response to this issue, a non-parametric statistical method-wavelet analysis is introduced in this study. Based on this innovative technique, we not only could detect the abrupt change points with a comparatively small data sample, but also could evaluate the impact from the abrupt change points by reconstructing the wavelet coefficient/de-noising the raw data, which had never been considered in previous studies of office markets. Our empirical results suggest that the wavelet reconstruction method, to some extent, makes it easier for the detection of the existence of structural change points. More interestingly, our findings also indicate that free market economies (i.e. Hong Kong and Singapore) are mainly influenced by the effects of global events, whereas the actual (net) impact on socialist economies (i.e. Beijing and Shanghai), depends on both the openness of the economies, and the magnitude of counter domestic forces put in place.},

In general, due to the various types of information exchange within the industry, there is a relationship between the stocks that can reveal their clear structural characteristics. Complex network methods are powerful tools for studying the internal structure and function of the stock market, which allows us to better understand the stock market. Applying complex network methodology, a stock associated network model based on financial indicators is created. Accordingly, we set threshold value and use modularity to detect the community network, and we analyze the network structure and community cluster characteristics of different threshold situations. The study finds that the threshold value of 0.7 is the abrupt change point of the network. At the same time, as the threshold value increases, the independence of the community strengthens. This study provides a method of researching stock market based on the financial indicators, exploring the structural similarity of financial indicators of stocks. Also, it provides guidance for investment and corporate financial management.},

The Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) method and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at a spatial resolution of 250m were used to detect vegetation dynamics in Quebec during 2000–2011. The overall agreement between BFAST detected breaks and observed disturbances was about 64\% with the highest agreement up to 80\% for “Fire” disturbance. The results presented in this study indicated that 25.7\% of the total study area experienced NDVI trend changes with one or more breaks during 2000–2011, most of which were detected in the Boreal Shield eco-zone along the coastline of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Abrupt vegetation changes barely varied under different eco-zones while considerably varied with different land cover types. The abrupt changes areas in 2002 and 2009 were the two greatest, with area percentages of 17.4\% and 29.1\% of the whole area, respectively. The area percentages of years with abrupt trend changes indicated that abrupt vegetation greening occurred in 2008 and 2009, especially in 2009, with 58.3\% of the overall abrupt greening. Abrupt vegetation browning occurred in 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2007, especially in 2002, with 28.2\% of the overall abrupt browning. Moreover, our results indicated that the detected vegetation trends varied temporally and spatially. Disturbances from existing field observations or remotely sensed images could only interpret {\textless}40\% of the vegetation changes. The impact of climate change on vegetation dynamic is particularly worth being investigated in the future work. To our knowledge, this study is one of the few attempting to explore large-scale detection of vegetation dynamics and their potential drivers in eastern Canada.},

Recent advances in in-vehicle sensors facilitate continuous monitoring of driving behaviors; large-scale driving data have been accumulated. This study develops a framework to evaluate large-scale driving records and to establish clusters that can be used to identify potentially aggressive driving behaviors. The framework employs three steps of data analytic methods: abrupt change detection to extract meaningful driving events from raw data, feature extraction using an auto-encoder, and two-level clustering. This framework is applied to real driving data that were obtained from 43 taxis in Korean metropolitan cities. The application shows that the framework can characterize driving patterns from large-scale driving records and identify clusters with high potential for aggressive driving. The findings imply that the outcome clusters represent the norm of driving behavior and thus can be used as a reference in diagnosing other drivers’ behavior.},

In that manner, we first estimate the dynamic correlations between these variables using the VAR(p)–FIAPARCH(1,d,1)–cDCC(1,1) approach. Then, we endogenously detect the volatility shift dates by a novel method of penalized contrast functions and investigate the relation between the dynamic correlations and the high volatile periods. Results reveal that volatility shocks create abrupt changes in the dynamic correlations, however this effect is only short term and do not sustain between consecutive high volatility regimes.

The results showed the following. (1) The change in sedimentation rate can be completely decomposed into three quasi-periodic changes on 3.7, 6.4, and 24-yr time scales, and a long-term trend. (2) The quasi-periodic changes in sedimentation rate are significantly and positively related to changes in annual average temperature at 6.4 and 24-yr time scales and human activities at 3.7-yr time scales, and not significantly related to precipitation at these time scales. The trend of sedimentation rate has a negative relation with temperature, but positive relations with precipitation and human activities. As a whole, the total variance contribution of climate changes to the quasi-periodic changes of sedimentation rate is close to that of human activities; (3) Temperature and precipitation are possibly related to the abrupt change of sedimentation rate as a whole. Floods have significant impacts on abrupt changes in the sedimentation rate at 3.7, 6.4 and 24-yr time scales. Moreover, some abrupt changes of sedimentation rate at 3.7- and 6.4-yr time scales are partly related to the changes of precipitation at 3.1-yr time scale and temperature at 5-yr time scale. The results of this study will help identify the impacts of climate change and human activities on lake sedimentation at different time scales, and will be available for use as a guide for reasonable development and effective protection of lake resources.},

Our proposed method not only detects and classifies the ECG noises but also localizes the ECG noises which can play a crucial role in extracting reliable clinical features for ECG analysis systems. The proposed method is based on three stages: Wavelet decomposition of ECG signal into sub-bands; simultaneous ECG signal and noise reconstruction; extraction of temporal features such as maximum absolute amplitude, zerocrossings, kurtosis and autocorrelation function for detection, localization and classification of ECG noises including flat line (FL), time-varying noise or pause (TVN), baseline wander (BW), abrupt change (AB), power line interference (PLI), muscle artifacts (MA) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The proposed method is tested and validated against manually annotated ECG signals corrupted with aforementioned noises taken from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, Physionet challenge database, and real-time recorded ECG signals. Comparative detection and classification results depict the superior performance of the proposed method over state of art methods. Detection results show that our method can achieve an average sensitivity (Se), average specificity (Sp) and accuracy (A) of 99.61\%, 98.51\%, 99.49\% respectively. Also, the method achieves a Se of 98.18\%, and Sp of 94.97\% for real-time recorded ECG signals. The method has an average timing error of 0.14s in localizing the noise segments. Further, classification results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average sensitivity (Se), average positive predictivity (PP) and classification accuracy (Ac) of 98.53\%, 98.89\%, 97.50\% respectively.},

Non-parametric approaches, such as the Gaussian kernel based change point (KCP) detection (Arlot et al., 2012), are especially attractive because they impose less assumptions on the data. Yet, a drawback of these methods is that most of them are sensitive to changes in the mean, the variance, etc., making them less sensitive to specific kinds of changes. We show that KCP can be adapted to detect a particular type of change only. We focus here on correlation change, which has been put forward by different theories but proved hard to trace in multivariate time series. We propose KCP-corr, which boils down to applying KCP on the running correlations. To confirm that KCP-corr is more sensitive than merely applying KCP on the raw data (KCP-raw), a simulation study was conducted in which the number of (noise) variables and the size of the correlation change were varied. KCP-corr emerged as the better method especially in the more difficult but realistic settings where the correlation change is minimal and/or noise variables are present. KCP-corr also outperforms Cusum, a non-parametric method that specifically targets the detection of correlation changes.},

This task is not simple, due to a large variability of factors in the ecosystem and the difficulty in identifying them. Based on the Ecopath approach, we developed a means for analyzing the Lake Kinneret ecosystem by comparing two mass balance models representing two very different periods. The first model is based on the period of 1990–1993, prior to a regime shift that occurred in the ecosystem and the second model is based on 2006–2010, a period characterized by unstable behavior in the ecosystem. Examining the differences between the two models allowed us to map changes in the ecosystem and to identify the changes and the ecosystem components affected by the regime shift. Using the results we demonstrate the potential of providing management recommendations regarding Lake Kinneret's ecosystem and fishery.},

	abstract = {Summary During the last few decades, Europe has seen a faster increase of observed temperature than that simulated by models. The air temperature over Western Europe showed an abrupt shift at the end of the 1980s, still insufficiently documented. The aim of this study is to assess the characteristics of this shift and its potential impacts on the hydrological cycle over France. Such an assessment is essential for a better understanding of past and future climatic changes and their impact on water resources. A subset of 119 temperature, 122 rainfall, and 30 hydrometric stations was studied, over the entire French metropolitan territory. Several change-point detection tests were applied to temperature, rainfall and runoff time series. A shift in annual mean air temperature was detected in 1987/88, for more than 75\% of the stations, and for both minimum and maximum temperatures. An abrupt increase of about 1°C in minimum and maximum temperature provides evidence of this shift, which shows strong seasonality, with significant increases for DJF, MAM and JJA. Its detection is not affected by the length of the time series or any potential artefacts associated to the conditions of measurement. Cluster analysis of the rainfall stations was used to take account of regional variability in rainfall evolution. Two climate areas were obtained from this analysis: Mediterranean and temperate. No shift was detected in rainfall for either area. However, at annual and quarterly scales, several changes in runoff were observed between the periods 1969–87 and 1988–09. The significant changes occurred from January to July, in agreement with maximum increases in temperature. Evapotranspiration could well play a key role in these changes in the hydrological cycle, as a response to temperature increases in the watersheds studied.},

	abstract = {Ecological thresholds are abrupt changes of ecological state. While an ecological threshold is a widely accepted concept, most empirical methods detect them in time or across geographic space. Although useful, these approaches do not quantify the direct drivers of threshold response. Causal understanding of thresholds detected empirically requires their investigation in a multi-factor domain containing the direct drivers (often referred to as state space). Here, we present an approach to quantify thresholds from response surfaces modeled empirically in state space. We present two indices of shape attributes measured from response surfaces. The response surfaces are built using a regression method in state space. The indices are threshold strength (T) and diagonality (D). We use 48 simulated response surfaces of different shapes to test the efficacy of the indices in 3D. Our results show that T is sensitive to the steepness of the transition from one state to the next, with various forms of abrupt, centralized thresholds yielding the highest values among the simulated surfaces. D represents the orientation of the response surface or the simultaneous influence of more than one predictor in eliciting the response gradient. Strongly diagonal surfaces have the most diagonal surface area demonstrated by sharply undulating diagonal surfaces. Given that the success of T and D requires a regression method to accurately capture any shape of complex data structure, we also test the accuracy of empirical regression methods known to be tractable with complex data. We test classification and regression trees (CART), Random Forest, and non-parametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) for binary and continuous responses. We use the 48 simulated response surfaces to test the methods, and we find that prediction accuracy depends on both the T and D of the simulated data for each method. We choose the most accurate method among those we test for capturing any shape of response surface from real data, NPMR. Finally, we use NPMR to build response surfaces and quantify T and D from real ecological data sets. We demonstrate how measuring threshold strength and diagonality from multi-factor response surfaces can advance ecology.},

This estimating procedure allows us to estimate all the parameters involved in the monetary policy, providing an alternative way to calibration. We present empirical evidence for the US, the UK and the EMU to show the potential applicability of our estimation method. Our findings show that the evidence of a regime change in US monetary policy making from 1997 to 2001 is weak. However, September eleven and the recession that started in the second quarter of 2001 emerge as events that probably led to regime shifts in US monetary policy making. Also the mortgage subprime crisis is another key event affecting the central bank's decisions worldwide. We show that the use of a Taylor rule with time-varying responses in accordance with a Markov-switching setting leads to empirical findings consistent with those obtained with the particle filter.},

This article optimizes the mathematical model for spring-powered NFI by considering the hydraulic loss due to the abrupt change in the nozzle exit area and the friction force between the piston and ampoule. We explore the dispersion pattern in gels with different nozzle diameters. Mice insulin injection was conducted to investigate the pharmacological effect of different injection methods. The experimental results show that there is the best dispersion effect and available injection depth while the nozzle diameter is 0.30 mm, which is in agreement with the result predicted by the mathematical model. Also, there is a satisfactory pharmacological effect on the mice insulin injection under the same injection condition. Undoubtedly, the mathematical model is capable of predicting the suitable nozzle diameter under the given conditions.},

	abstract = {In smart cities, an intelligent traffic surveillance system plays a crucial role in reducing traffic jams and air pollution, thus improving the quality of life. An intelligent traffic surveillance should be able to detect and track multiple vehicles in real-time using only limited resources. Conventional tracking methods usually run at a high video-sampling rate, assuming that the same vehicles in successive frames are similar and move only slightly. However, in cost effective embedded surveillance systems (e.g., a distributed wireless network of smart cameras), video frame rates are typically low because of limited system resources. Therefore, conventional tracking methods perform poorly in embedded surveillance systems because of discontinuity of the moving vehicles in the captured recordings. In this study, we present a fast and light algorithm that is suitable for an embedded real-time visual surveillance system to detect effectively and track multiple moving vehicles whose appearance and/or position changes abruptly at a low frame rate. For effective tracking at low frame rates, we propose a new matching criterion based on greedy data association using appearance and position similarities between detections and trackers. To manage abrupt appearance changes, manifold learning is used to calculate appearance similarity. To manage abrupt changes in motion, the next probable centroid area of the tracker is predicted using trajectory information. The position similarity is then calculated based on the predicted next position and progress direction of the tracker. The proposed method demonstrates efficient tracking performance during rapid feature changes and is tested on an embedded platform (ARM with DSP-based system).},

Detecting whether such shifts are gradual or abrupt is a growing concern for water resources planning and management. This paper shows that conventional trend and change-point tests do not adequately enable these two types of change to be distinguished. We propose a method for combining the rank correlations of the Mann–Kendall and Pettitt statistics to extract an indicator whose value determines whether a shift observed in a given time series is gradual or abrupt. This method allows the success rate to be independent of the length of record, and it is validated with Monte-Carlo experiments. The limitations caused by the short and noisy nature of hydroclimatic time series are discussed. As an application, the proposed method provides useful insights on changes in hydroclimatic variables in the United States during 1910–2009 using time series from 1217 stations in the United States Hydroclimatic Data Network (USHCN).},

	abstract = {The effective use of satellite image time series for examining vegetation response patterns across regional extents requires a method which accounts for variation at the seasonal scale while simultaneously detecting abrupt changes in any long term trends. The Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) algorithm has been developed to do this. However, its effectiveness in semi-arid regions, where vegetation response is typically aseasonal, has yet to be assessed. In this research the BFAST algorithm was assessed for a semi-arid study area in the Paroo catchment of far north-western New South Wales, Australia. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) EVI time series were decomposed using BFAST for 270 sample pixels to assess the algorithm's ability to detect abrupt changes in vegetation response caused by known fires and floods. The algorithm was also applied across the study area to examine regional patterns in the timing and magnitude of abrupt changes and the direction and magnitude of the long term trends. The timing of breaks detected by BFAST corresponded with the timing of known floods in the study region for between 68\% and 79\% of breaks detected across the sample pixels, depending on the parameters used in the decomposition. BFAST was not, however, able to accurately detect fires in the Paroo region, with agreement between the timing of breaks and fires occurring in only 3\% of breaks detected. This most likely reflects the low EVI values present before a fire event, which would be typical of semi-arid zones. Spatial patterns in the timing of abrupt changes and greening and browning trends across the study area were a function of land cover and vegetation type. These results indicate that BFAST is able to detect abrupt changes in vegetation greening caused by known floods in semi-arid regions. The presence of spatial patterns in the results also indicates that the algorithm is sensitive to vegetation cover type. BFAST is therefore able to detect abrupt trend changes in regions where vegetation response is not expected to show strong seasonal patterns and could be used in further applications such as classification or regional vegetation modelling in semi-arid environments.},

	abstract = {Background This study sought to evaluate the predictors of malignancy in the 2012 international consensus guidelines for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and validate their diagnostic value relative to the 2006 guidelines. Methods Between 2002 and 2014, 177 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection of IPMN were reviewed. Based on the 2012 guidelines, high-risk stigmata (mural nodule with enhancement, main pancreatic duct [MPD] ≥ 10 mm, and obstructive jaundice) and worrisome features (cyst size ≥ 30 mm, thickened cyst wall, mural nodule without enhancement, MPD 5–9 mm, an abrupt change in MPD diameter, and lymphadenopathy) were assessed, and predictive and diagnostic values were analyzed statistically. Results Multivariate analysis identified obstructive jaundice (odds ratio [OR], 23.9; P {\textless} .0001), abrupt change in MPD diameter (OR, 3.01; P = .017) and lymphadenopathy (OR, 5.84; P = .027) as independent predictive factors, with an accuracy of 69.8, 67.4, and 66.3\%, respectively. Operative intervention was indicated in 156 patients (94.0\%) using the 2006 guidelines, and in 130 (78.3\%) using the 2012 guidelines. The accuracy of the 2006 guidelines was 35.5\% compared with 44.8\% for the 2012 guidelines. The area under the curve (AUC) for the 2006 and 2012 guidelines was 0.65 and 0.67, respectively; ΔAUC was 0.02, which was not statistically significant. When the worrisome features were combined with high-risk stigmata, the AUC increased to 0.79. Conclusion Obstructive jaundice, abrupt change in MPD diameter, and lymphadenopathy were independent predictive factors in the 2012 guidelines with high accuracy. Using the new guidelines, the number of patients with IPMN managed with observation and the predictive accuracy increased.},

To fill in this gap, the wavelet analysis with minimax threshold is introduced in this paper. By comparing Daubechies LA(8), wavelet analysis with minimax threshold is a versatile and powerful approach to the analysis of residential data as they are flexible in their function form and provide a robust computational method even with a small sample size. The detected change points reflect some significant political issues and economic collapses. It can be shown from the empirical result that a “diffusion relationship” happened from one location to another.},

Abrupt changes for most of precipitation indices mainly occurred around 1957 during 1938–2005. Return periods for all seven precipitation indices concentrated in 10-year period.

	abstract = {Regime shifts in benthic invertebrates within coastal ecosystems threaten the survival of wading birds (Charadrii). Predicting how invertebrate regime shifts will affect wading birds allows conservation management and mitigation measures to be implemented, including protection of terrestrial feeding areas. An individual-based model was used to investigate the impact of regime shifts on wading birds through their prey (marine worms and bivalves) in the estuarine system Poole Harbour, (UK). The model predicted the number of curlew (Numenius arquata), oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), redshank (Tringa totanus) and dunlin (Calidris alpina) supported in the Harbour during the non-breeding season (autumn and winter months). The most dramatic declines in bird numbers were for regime shifts that reduced the abundance of the largest invertebrates, particularly marine worms. The least adaptable bird species (those with the most restrictive diets) were unable to compensate by consuming other prey. Generally, as birds adapt to changes by switching to alternative prey species and size classes, changes in invertebrate size and species distribution do not necessarily affect the number of birds that the Harbour can support. Our predictions reveal a weakness in using birds as indicators of site health and invertebrate regime shifts. Differences in bird populations would not necessarily be detected by standard survey methods until extreme changes in invertebrate communities had occurred, potentially beyond the point at which these changes could be reversed. Therefore, population size of wading birds should not be used in isolation when assessing the conservation status of coastal sites.},

	abstract = {Theory suggests that ecological systems exhibit a pronounced slow down in their dynamics, known as ‘critical slowing down’ (CSD), before they undergo regime shifts or critical transitions. As a result of CSD, ecosystems exhibit characteristic temporal and spatial changes which can be used as early warning signals of imminent regime shifts. For temporal data, statistical methods to detect these generic indicators of ecosystem resilience are well developed. However, for spatial data, despite a well developed theoretical framework, statistical methods such as data pre-processing and null models to detect EWS are relatively poorly developed. In this manuscript, we investigate the case of a common type of ecological spatial dataset which consists of binary values at each location (e.g. occupied/unoccupied, tree/grass or coralline/bleached). We employ a cellular-automaton based spatially-explicit model which generates data that mimics remotely sensed or field collected high-resolution spatial data with a binary classification of the state variables at each location. We demonstrate that trends in two spatial metrics, spatial variance and spatial skewness, of such binary spatial data lead to false, failed or misleading signals of transitions. We find that, two other indicators, spatial autocorrelation at lag-1 and spectral density ratio, accurately reflect CSD even with binary spatial data. To overcome the problems associated with detection of EWS using spatial variance and skewness, we investigate a data pre-processing method called ‘coarse-graining’ which is inspired from the physics literature on phase transitions. Coarse-graining reduces the spatial resolution of data by averaging state variables over small scales. Yet, it enables detection of CSD-based spatial indicators of impending critical transitions. In summary, our study provides a theoretical basis, and rigorous evaluation, of coarse-graining as a pre-processing step to analyse spatial datasets with discrete state classifications.},

Existing archives, which house millions of fish otoliths (ear stones) constitute an excellent basis for such research; but, they remain underutilized. The objective of this project was to identify the factors that influence the annual growth patterns of the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) based on an analysis of otolith increments. We applied linear mixed models to develop a 74-year long chronology that reflects the inter-annual variations in flounder growth rates using otolith samples collected from 1957 to 2016 in the southern part of the Baltic Sea, which is considered to be highly vulnerable to global climate change. By analyzing the widths of otolith increments we revealed the existence of common environmental factors that influence fish growth. Using a mixed modeling framework, we incorporated a recent method to identify the optimal time window for climatic factors and showed that the most significant effect of the mean Baltic Sea Index occurs during August–December, while mean sea surface temperature is most significant from April–June. Change point analysis on the developed chronology identified major alterations occurred in flounder growth in 1988, 1992 and 2006. This result is in accord with published studies on regime shifts in the Baltic Sea ecosystem. This paper reports information concerning the response of the commercially important European flounder to the changing environment that may support future ecosystem-based management of fish stocks. Moreover, the results also highlight the potential for applying biochronological techniques to identify rapid regime shifts in marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Detecting the effectiveness of management actions intended to increase the abundance of threatened or exploited species can help resolve uncertainties about cost-effective management tactics. However, the complexity of ecological systems can make it difficult to identify important factors causing change in population abundance. This difficulty extends from detecting naturally-caused ecosystem regime shifts to management-induced regime shifts and the attendant change in population dynamics parameters. The adult abundance of naturally-produced coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) on the Oregon Coast generally declined until these fish were listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1998. The subsequent rebuilding of Oregon coastal coho adult abundance is coincident with increased habitat restoration, reduced hatchery production, and reduced harvest. Importantly, ocean survival also improved, thereby complicating the assessment of management effectiveness at the adult life stage. Our objective was to assess change in the freshwater production of juveniles (smolts) through time in order to determine if recent increases in adult abundance could be related to management affecting the freshwater juvenile production. We combined 46 years of data associated with 18 populations of Oregon coastal coho. Spawner-to-smolt relationships were modeled with Bayesian hierarchical state-space implementations of the logistic hockey stick recruitment function. We also develop a method of estimating the relative reproductive success of hatchery spawners. We found more evidence for decline than increase in productivity in the spawner-to-smolt life stage, suggesting that changes in physical oceanographic conditions are responsible for recent increases in adult abundance. The reproductive success of hatchery-origin fish relative to natural-origin fish was 0.51 with a 95\% credible interval from 0.19 to 0.89. While some management effects may unfold on longer time-scales than we observed, we nonetheless contend that carefully tailored models of non-stationary population dynamics are needed to understand and the effectiveness of management actions intended to recover populations.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems are highly nonlinear dissipative systems that often admit multiple alternative stable states, but seldom have the time span to converge to these states as they are repeatedly interfered by environmental changes and disturbances. Multiplicity of stable states in variable and disturbed environments is of high concern because of the possible occurrence of regime shifts, i.e. state transitions that involve large, abrupt decline in ecosystem function. State transitions induced by disturbances, however, need not be abrupt as the disturbances are often limited in their spatial extent. In that case they induce local state transitions that result in spatially confined alternative-state domains. The subsequent dynamics crucially depend on the dynamics of the transition zones or fronts that bound these domains. In this paper we study three aspects of front dynamics that affect the nature of regime shifts and their outcomes: single-front motion, front interactions and front instabilities. Using models of dryland vegetation as a case study we show that fronts can change their speed and invert their direction of motion as parameters change across a threshold value – the Maxwell point, that fronts may slow down or stop entirely when interacting with other fronts, and that disturbances may change one front type to another, each with its distinct speed. We further study the implications of these three aspects of front dynamics to gradual regime shifts. We show that such shifts can occur due to the propagation of a perturbation beyond its original extent, that such a transition does not necessarily culminate in the alternative state, i.e. it may remain incomplete, and that the time it takes for a regime shift to occur can be changed by front manipulations. Since gradual regime shifts can take place far from the typical tipping point considered, early warning signals of an approaching tipping point would fail in predicting gradual regime shifts. A more relevant approach for these regime shifts may be the development of detection and prevention methods, which can be applied during an ongoing gradual regime shift due to its slow dynamics. We conclude with a discussion of the need to develop such methods and of other ecological contexts that may benefit from them.},

	abstract = {Abrupt changes are an important manifestation of hydrological variability. How to accurately detect the abrupt changes in hydrological time series and evaluate their significance is an important issue, but methods for dealing with them effectively are lacking. In this study, we propose an approach to evaluate the significance of abrupt changes in time series at five levels: no, weak, moderate, strong, and dramatic. The approach was based on an index of correlation coefficient calculated for the original time series and its abrupt change component. A bigger value of correlation coefficient reflects a higher significance level of abrupt change. Results of Monte-Carlo experiments verified the reliability of the proposed approach, and also indicated the great influence of statistical characteristics of time series on the significance level of abrupt change. The approach was derived from the relationship between correlation coefficient index and abrupt change, and can estimate and grade the significance levels of abrupt changes in hydrological time series. Application of the proposed approach to ten major watersheds in China showed that abrupt changes mainly occurred in five watersheds in northern China, which have arid or semi-arid climate and severe shortages of water resources. Runoff processes in northern China were more sensitive to precipitation change than those in southern China. Although annual precipitation and surface water resources amount (SWRA) exhibited a harmonious relationship in most watersheds, abrupt changes in the latter were more significant. Compared with abrupt changes in annual precipitation, human activities contributed much more to the abrupt changes in the corresponding SWRA, except for the Northwest Inland River watershed.},

	abstract = {There have been significant regime shifts in the ecosystem structure and function in a large number of lakes worldwide due to the increasing human disturbance and climate change in recent decades. It has become a critical issue in lake conservation and management to identify the characteristics of regime shifts in lakes and explore potential early-warning signals prior to regime shifts. However, research on identifying and predicting regime shifts in lakes is still a difficult task since recent modelling approaches cannot fully grasp the non-linear processes among multiple ecosystem components and the ecological time series data are too scarce to support the detection in most lakes. In this study, multi-proxy paleolimnological records were used to obtain long time-series ecological data and determine the inflection points of regime shifts in the Baiyangdian Lake, northern China. First, the sediment chronology was established, and macrophyte pollen as well as nutrient conditions in each dated sediment layer were identified. Then the heuristic segmentation algorithm and Pettitt test were used to determine the most significant inflection points of regime shifts. Additionally, multiple early-warning indicators including variance, autocorrelation and skewness were used to test their ability to forecast the major ecosystem regime shift. Results show that the most important abrupt change in the Baiyangdian Lake occurred in the early 1960s. The increasing variance coupled with decreasing autocorrelation and skewness started in 1–16 years before this regime shift, which is consistent with a flickering phenomenon rather than critical slowing down. The detection results of regime shifts and early-warning signals can provide valuable reference information for the lake management and aquatic ecosystem conservation.},

Additional experiments were carried out using diphenylhexatriene to compare the results extracted from both probes. Fluorescence decays were analyzed by the maximum entropy method. Pressure does not influence the fluorescence lifetime distribution of trans-parinaric acid in isotropic solvents. However, in pressurized lipid bilayers an abrupt change was observed in the lifetime distribution which was associated with the isothermal pressure-induced phase transition. The pressure to temperature equivalence values, dT/dP, determined from the midpoint of the phase transitions, were 24 and 14.5 degrees C kbar-1 for DMPC and POPC, respectively. Relatively moderate pressures of about 500 bar shifted the DMPC/DPPC phase diagram 11.5 degrees C to higher temperatures. The effects of pressure on the structural properties of these lipid vesicles were investigated from the anisotropy decays of both probes. Order parameters for all systems increased with pressure. In the gel phase of POPC the order parameter was smaller than that obtained in the same phase of saturated phospholipids, suggesting that an efficient packing of the POPC hydrocarbon chains is hindered.},

	abstract = {Capillary diameter is generally measured by methods requiring a trained observer to determine the location of the vessel walls. We have developed a video computer method for measurement of capillary diameter, based on temporal fluctuations of light intensity within the lumen due to the passage of red cells. These fluctuations are quantified, at successive points along a line perpendicular to the capillary by sampling, with a microcomputer, the output of a video analyzer and calculating the variance of light intensity with time at each point. A profile of this variance, across the vessel, shows an abrupt change at each edge of the flowing red cell column. The edge of the lumen is “defined,” for the computer program, as the last point before the variance of light intensity becomes significantly greater than in the surrounding tissue. The method thus assumes there is no detectable cell-free plasma layer adjacent to the vessel wall. Both in vitro and in vivo tests showed good agreement between luminal diameters measured by a trained observer and by the video computer method. Each diameter measurement requires 2.5 sec for data acquisition and 0.3 sec for computation. This automated technique applies a standard criterion to the measurement of capillary diameter and thus avoids subjective error. It may be used for sequential measurements, e.g., where the microvessel diameter is changing with time.},

Animals Twelve adult healthy horses weighing between 434 and 640 kg. Materials and methods Horses were sedated, placed in stocks and subjected to caudal extradural anaesthesia using lidocaine 2\%. For extradural puncture an 18 gauge Tuohy needle connected to an acoustic device via an electronic pressure transducer was used. This device allowed recording of the extradural pressure profile and the transformation of pressure changes into an audible signal. Extradural needle advancement was stopped and the local anaesthetic administered when either a sharp decrease in sound pitch occurred or a ‘pop’ sensation was felt. Correct needle placement was assessed clinically by the degree of extradural anaesthesia present using needle prick stimuli, loss of tail tone and occurrence of localized sweating. Descriptive statistical analysis was used for evaluation of the data. Results Extradural anaesthesia was successful in nine of 12 horses. In these horses during extradural needle advancement the pitch of the audible signal first increased and abruptly changed to a constant low pitched sound. In the three horses with unsuccessful punctures only a slight decrease of the pitch was noted. A ‘pop’ was clearly distinguished in five of nine horses with successful extradural puncture. In four horses a ‘pop’ was not present despite correct extradural needle placement. In three horses with incorrect needle placement a ‘pop’ was present. In the horses with correct needle positioning the median extradural pressure after the puncture was −0.8 kPa (−6 mmHg). Conclusion and clinical relevance The acoustic device is useful to assist in the identification of successful or unsuccessful extradural needle placement in the horse.},

The water content-signal strength relationship has an abrupt change at a location related to the degree of hydration and corresponding to the D-dry state. The results indicate that there are two thermally distinct states of water detected by the method in cement paste. These two types of water are apparently sequentially removed upon first drying. The first type of water to be removed may be physically bound water and the second type chemically bound water.

Phase transitions were induced by changes in temperature and lipid composition (i.e., XCHOL was varied from 0.0 to 0.5 and XDMPC from 0.0 to 1.0). In DPPC/CHOL and DHPC/CHOL bilayers, the addition of CHOL induces only a modest change in the permeability coefficient (Pm) of acetic acid in the gel-phase (Pβ′) but significantly reduces Pm in ordered and disordered liquid-crystalline phases (Lo and Lα). Abrupt changes in slopes in semi-logarithmic plots of Pm vs. XCHOL occur at specific values of XCHOL and temperature corresponding to the boundaries between Pβ′ and Lo or between Lα and Lo phases. In most respects, phase diagrams generated from the break points in plots of Pm vs. XCHOL obtained at various temperatures in DHPC/CHOL and DPPC/CHOL bilayers closely resemble those constructed previously for DPPC/CHOL bilayers using NMR and DSC methods. Above Tm, the phase diagrams generated from permeability data reveal the presence of both the disordered (Lα) and the ordered (Lo) liquid-crystalline phases, as well as the two-phase coexistence region. In DPPC/DMPC bilayers, the addition of DMPC increases Pm dramatically in the gel phase but only slightly in the liquid-crystalline phase. Abrupt changes in slopes in semi-logarithmic plots of Pm vs. XDMPC also occur at specific values of XDMPC and temperature, from which a phase diagram can be constructed which closely resembles diagrams obtained previously by other methods. These correlations indicate that trans-bilayer permeability measurements can be used to construct lipid bilayer phase diagrams. Positive deviations of Pm from predicted values based on the phase lever rule are observed in the two-phase coexistence regions with the degree of the deviation depending on bilayer chemical composition and temperature. These results may reflect a specific contribution of the interfacial region between two phases to higher solute permeability or may be due to the higher lateral compressibility of lipid bilayers in the two-phase coexistence region.},

	abstract = {When considering physical mechanisms for decadal-timescale climate variability in the North Pacific, it is useful to describe in detail the expected response of the ocean to the chaotic atmospheric forcing. The expected response to this white-noise forcing includes strongly enhanced power in the decadal frequency band relative to higher frequencies, pronounced changes in basin-wide climate that resemble regime shifts, preferred patterns of spatial variability, and a depth-dependent profile that includes variability with a standard deviation of 0.2–0.4°C over the top 50–100 m. Weak spectral peaks are also possible, given ocean dynamics. Detecting coupled ocean–atmosphere modes of variability in the real climate system is difficult against the spectral and spatial structure of this ‘null-hypothesis’ of how the ocean and atmosphere interact, especially given the impossibility of experimentally decoupling the ocean from the atmosphere. Turning to coupled ocean–atmosphere models to address this question, a method for identifying coupled modes by using models of increasing physical complexity is illustrated. It is found that a coupled ocean–atmosphere mode accounts for enhanced variability with a time scale of 20 years/cycle in the Kuroshio extension region of the model's North Pacific. The observed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has many similarities to the expected noise-forced response and few similarities to the model's coupled ocean–atmosphere variability. However, model deficiencies and some analyses of observations by other workers indicate that the possibility that part of the PDO arises from a coupled ocean–atmosphere mode cannot be ruled out.},

	abstract = {Proteins 3D-QSAR is an emerging field of bioorganic chemistry. However, the large dimensions of the structures to be handled may become a bottleneck to scaling up classic QSAR problems for proteins. In this sense, truncation approach could be used as in molecular dynamic to perform timely calculations. The spherical truncation of electrostatic field with different functions breaks down long-range interactions at a given cutoff distance (roff) resulting in short-range ones. Consequently, a Markov chain model may approach to the average electrostatic potentials of spatial distribution of charges within the protein backbone. These average electrostatic potentials can be used to predict proteins properties. Herein, we explore the effect of abrupt, shifting, force shifting, and switching truncation functions on 3D-QSAR models classifying 26 proteins with different functions: lysozymes, dihydrofolate reductases, and alcohol dehydrogenases. Almost all methods have shown overall accuracies higher than 73\%. The present result points to an acceptable robustness of the MC for different truncation schemes and roff values. The results of best accuracy 92\% with abrupt truncation coincide with our recent communication. We also developed models with the same accuracy value for other truncation functions; however they are more complex functions. PCA analysis for 152 non-homologous proteins has shown that there are five main eigenvalues, which explain more than 87\% of the variance of the studied properties. The present molecular descriptors may encode structural information not totally accounted for the previous ones, so success with these descriptors could be expected when classic fails. The present result confirms the utility of our Markov models combined with truncation approach to generate bioorganic structure protein molecular descriptors for QSAR.},

The onset of pyrolysis was estimated by means of an IR camera with an MMA filter, a small load cell, thermocouples, and flow visualization. Onset of gasification due to material pyrolysis occurs significantly earlier than piloted ignition. Therefore, models of standard test methods such as ASTM-E-1321 must incorporate preignition gasification to properly model the ignition process. To better establish the mechanisms controlling the degradation process, controlled mass loss tests were conducted with shavings from the PMMA plates. Tests in nitrogen and oxygenated atmospheres were conducted with thermogravimetric analysis and evolved gas measurements using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Results indicated a one-step degradation process in pure N2, while a two-step reaction could be observed in the presence of O2. As the O2 fraction increased, the onset of degradation shifted to lower temperatures, but the second step correlated well with that of N2 degradation. The evolved gas measurements suggest that both reactions were limited by mass transport, with the first reaction limited by O2 diffusion into the sample. Mass transport limitations were identified by abrupt changes in the slope of the production rate of evolved gases, and this indicates the importance of coupling thermogravimetric analyzer measurements with evolved gas analysis for detecting mass transport limitations. Implications of these results on interpreting material flammability tests are discussed in this paper.},

Objects are claimed to cause constellations of sensory signals that frequently occur in association with each other, that can have names attached, and that not only form the elements of the cognitive world but also are the appropriate elements for associative learning. Fixed action patterns are genetically determined; therefore, their trigger features can be genetically determined as well. In contrast, the objects that one learns about are not genetically determined (or anyway not entirely); therefore, sensory messages must be classified and categorized in a flexible way that depends upon the actual sensory experience of the animal. The chapter presents a table that summarizes the relations that one can trace between the statistical properties of the sensory input and mechanisms in the visual system to deal with them. Two network methods have recently been proposed for defining the appropriate generalization field from the sensory messages themselves, without external instruction or reinforcement. Both methods assume that successive patterns are not independent but related. This is because objects do not abruptly change their nature or identity; they exploit the temporal equivalent of the tendency for objects to be localised in space.},

Methods PXAs were selected from the Royal Children’s Hospital archives over 30 years. The clinical features and pathology were reviewed, specifically checking the histological variation between areas, and the changes between biopsies. Results Fifteen patients were identified. Ten had repeat biopsies. Eleven patients did not show histological features of anaplasia. Of these eleven, three did not show the characteristic histological features, which developed 3 and 11 years later in repeat biopsies in two. Seven showed uncommon potentially confusing histology. One died, one had stable disease and one had progressive disease. Three with incomplete initial surgery remained in complete remission following more surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy when the tumours progressed, up to 11 years later. Four patients did show anaplasia, with abrupt change from typical PXA in two, and years following initial biopsy in one. Of these four patients, three died, one with extensive metastasis. Conclusions PXA should be considered in superficial cerebral tumours composed only of compact bundles of glial fibrillary acidic protein positive spindle cells with inconspicuous mitosis, even when the highly characteristic features of this tumour are not seen. The prominent variation in histology makes small biopsies difficult for diagnosis and assessing anaplasia. Patients with non-anaplastic tumours can often be salvaged by more treatment for tumour progression.},

	abstract = {Networks of neocortical neurons display a bistable activity pattern characterised by phases of high frequency action potential firing, so called up-states, and episodes of low discharge activity (down-states). We hypothesised that during down-states neocortical neurons are vulnerable to anaesthetic agents. To tackle this issue, it is necessary to identify analytical methods, which are sufficiently sensitive for resolving anaesthetic effects during phases of scarce neuronal activity. The local field potential was recorded in organotypic cultures (OTC) from rat neocortex under control conditions and in the presence of increasing concentrations of sevoflurane by extracellular electrodes. Epochs from down-states were cut from the local field potential and analysed using power spectrum density as well as non-linear parameters approximate entropy (ApEn) and order recurrence rate (ORR). ApEn and ORR proved to be suitable tools for analysing the actions of volatile anaesthetics on cortical down-states. During these phases of low neuronal activity, sevoflurane caused prominent changes in the local field potential. Time series analysis using ApEn showed a reduction of signal predictability in the presence of sevoflurane. Furthermore, the ORR displayed an abrupt decrease at sevoflurane concentrations corresponding to loss of consciousness in vivo, indicating a drug-induced decrease in the signal to noise ratio. The actions of volatile anaesthetics on cortical down-states have been neglected so far, perhaps due to the lack of suitable analysis tools. In the current in vitro study the non-linear parameters ApEn and ORR are introduced to characterise volatile anaesthetics actions. Sevoflurane alters cortical down-states as indicated by non-linear parameter analysis of local field potential recording from cultured neuronal networks. ORR even displays an abrupt change, i.e., a step-like behaviour indicating an increased signal complexity at concentrations of sevoflurane corresponding to loss of consciousness in humans.},

	abstract = {A new method is presented for determining the flocculation time of monodispersed sediment suspensions. Flocculation time is the critical time at which abrupt changes in the particle size spectrum of an aggregative suspension occurs. This method predicts flocculation times to within 6\% of values predicted by a geometric sectional aggregation model (Batterham, R.J., Hall, J.S. and Barton, G., 1981. In: Proceedings, 3rd International Symposium on Agglomeration, Nürnberg, Federal Republic of Germany, pp. A136–A150) but uses only a fraction of the computational effort. Flocculation times estimated in this way are superior to estimates of flocculation time scale made using half-life because particle geometry and differential settling encounter are taken into account. The proposed model is based on typical size distributions calculated using the Batterham et al. model. These size distributions have approximately equal mass in geometrically increasing size classes, i.e. they are Junge-dispersed. By assuming that the suspension remains Junge-dispersed throughout its evolution, the system of differential equations required to describe the suspension reduces to a single differential equation. Flocculation times are calculated for three values of maximum floc size (dmax=10,1,0.1mm), a maximum settling velocity of ws=1mms-1, and a variety of initial conditions. For a given set of inputs, flocculation times calculated in this way are linearly related to those calculated using the Batterham et al. model, but the slope of the relationship varies with fractal dimension. Multiple linear regression equations are developed to directly relate the two. The effect of including sinking losses into the Batterham et al. model is also investigated. If the sinking loss time scale is much longer than the flocculation time, then the suspension becomes flocculated at roughly the same time it would have had there been no sinking losses, and the new method can be used. Conversely, if the sinking time scale is less than or equal to the flocculation time, then the new method cannot be used.},

	abstract = {Climate change has already affected the phenology of several species. To be able to assess the impacts of climate change under various climate scenarios, we need superior models of the phenology of different species. Linear regression methods alone are of limited value for the analyses of natural indicators or phenological data because most time series of naturally occurring events in ecosystems do change in a nonlinear way. In this paper, we applied a Bayesian probability approach to investigate time series of the phenological phase of bud burst in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and mean monthly/weekly temperatures of corresponding climate stations in Germany. In these temperature and Norway spruce bud burst time series we detected years with the highest probability for discontinuities. We analysed rates of change and the relationship between temperature changes and bud burst of Norway spruce in the 51-year period 1953–2003. We used a Bayesian method for a coherence analysis between phenological onset dates and an effective temperature generated as a weighted average of monthly and weekly means from January to May. Weight coefficients were obtained from an optimization of the coherence factor by simulated annealing. In all investigated cases we found coherence factors that suggested a relationship between temperature and phenological time series. Norway spruce bud burst and mean temperature times series of April and May exhibited abrupt changes, particularly at the beginning of the 1980s. April and May temperature time series revealed an increased warming until 2003, and bud burst events advanced. Norway spruce bud burst, in particular, exhibited responses to temperatures of the previous (April) and current month (May). We suggest that besides commonly used sums of daily mean temperatures, forcing temperatures in phenology models should also include solutions where weighted effective temperatures in a sensitive time span are considered.},

	abstract = {The distribution of the G+C content in the human genome has been studied by using a windowless technique derived from the Z curve method. The most important findings presented in this paper are twofold. First, abrupt variations of the G+C content along human chromosome sequences are the main variation patterns of G+C content. It is found that at some sites, the G+C content undergoes abrupt changes from a G+C-rich region to a G+C-poor region alternatively and vice versa. Second, it is shown that long domains with relatively homogeneous G+C content along each chromosome do exist. These domains are thought to be isochores, which usually have sharp boundaries. Consequently, 56 isochores longer than 3 Mb have been identified in chromosomes 1–22, X and Y. Boundaries, size and G+C content of each isochore identified are listed in detail. As an example to demonstrate the power of the method, the boundary between the Classes III and II isochores of the MHC sequence has been determined and found to be at 2,477,936, which is in good agreement with the experimental evidence. A homogeneity index is introduced to measure the homogeneity of G+C content in isochores. We emphasize that the homogeneity of G+C content is relative. The isochores in which the G+C content keeps absolutely constant do not exist. Isochore structures appear to be a basic organization of the human genome. Due to the relevance to many important biological functions, the clarification of isochore structures will provide much insight into the understanding of the human genome.},

	abstract = {The Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey was initiated partly to contribute to our understanding of the variability of fish stocks and as a potential method for predicting fish distributions from the abundance and composition of the plankton. The latter objective has been superseded by technological developments in fish detection, but the former has been the subject of continuing, and in recent years expanding use of the CPR data. Examples are presented of application of the data to studies on North Sea herring, cod, mackerel, blue whiting and redfish as well as more general plankton studies relevant to fisheries research. Variations in the migration patterns of herring as well as recruitment have been related to abundances and species composition of the plankton in the CPR survey. Extensive use has been made of the CPR data in relation to cod, particularly in the development and testing of the ‘match-mismatch’ hypothesis. Advection of sufficient numbers of Calanus from the core oceanic areas of its distribution into the areas where the cod stocks occur may partly determine the success of those stocks. The analysis of the distribution and abundances of mackerel larvae in the CPR survey have shown contrasting variations between the North Sea and Celtic Sea. The expansion of the horse mackerel fishery in the north-eastern North Sea since 1987 has been related to physical events and a ‘regime shift’ in the plankton, described from CPR data. The oceanic spawning areas of the blue whiting and redfish were highlighted by the expansion of the CPR survey into the north-eastern and north-western Atlantic respectively. These results helped to focus the attention of fisheries scientists on stocks that have subsequently become the targets for commercial exploitation. The results of the CPR survey, particularly those on Calanus finmarchicus, the phytoplankton standing stock as measured by the CPR colour index, the overall patterns of trends in plankton abundance and distributions of indicator species have been used by fisheries scientists to interpret variations in fish stocks. Generally the CPR data can be used to determine whether changes in the distributions and growth rates of fish have resulted from changes in planktonic food, changes in strength of ocean currents and distribution of water masses and to identify trends in larval abundances. With the tightening regulation of fisheries to reduce overfishing, global climate change and changing anthropogenic inputs into the sea, the unique source of information on unexploited populations in the long-term time series of the CPR survey will be of increasing value to fisheries scientists in the study of natural variability.},

	abstract = {Forest owners’ values and the ownership structure of forest are changing continuously. One probable consequence of the current trends in Finland is that the significance of forest-related income will decrease, which may have a significant impact on the round wood supply. This study developed and demonstrated a new method, which allows policy makers to make forecasts on the future timber supply. The method is based on the assumed temporal changes in the distributions of the importance of different forest management goals. The distributions are converted into utility functions, generated separately for each forest holding. The utility functions are maximised, using heuristics, to obtain the optimal forest management plans for the holdings. The regional cutting budget is calculated by summing the removals of the optimal treatment schedules of stands over the whole area. The method was demonstrated by assuming four different scenarios for the forest management goals, in which the importance of net income from realised cuttings decreased by 0\%, 25\%, 50\% or 100\% in 60 years. The decrease was compensated for by an increased importance of the other goals, namely economic security, recreation, and nature values. The calculations were made with three different methods. Methods 1 and 2 derived the optimal plans directly for the whole 60-year period while Method 3 developed three consecutive 20-year plans. Method 2 assumed that the holding is sold or inherited once in 20 years with an abrupt change in the management goals. In Methods 1 and 3 the goals changed only gradually. The results were logical, indicating that the more the importance of net income decreases the lower the future timber supply will be.},

Within the class of the time series models that are used to perform price forecasting, the subclasses of methods based on stochastic time series and causal models commonly provide point forecasts, whereas the corresponding uncertainty is quantified by approximate or simulation-based confidence intervals. Aiming to improve the uncertainty assessment, this study introduces the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) to model the dynamically varying distribution of prices. The GAMLSS allow fitting a variety of distributions whose parameters change according to covariates via a number of linear and nonlinear relationships. In this way, price periodicities, trends and abrupt changes characterizing both the position parameter (linked to the expected value of prices), and the scale and shape parameters (related to price volatility, skewness, and kurtosis) can be explicitly incorporated in the model setup. Relying on the past behavior of the prices and exogenous variables, the GAMLSS enable the short-term (one-day ahead) forecast of the entire distribution of prices. The approach was tested on two datasets from the widely studied California Power Exchange (CalPX) market, and the less mature Italian Power Exchange (IPEX). CalPX data allow comparing the GAMLSS forecasting performance with published results obtained by different models. The study points out that the GAMLSS framework can be a flexible alternative to several linear and nonlinear stochastic models.},

The last part ensures that any catastrophic effects of grid redistribution due to the sudden appearance or disappearance of discontinuities in the solution caused by nonlinear interactions are avoided. Specifically, we describe and analyze an implicit, finite-difference, adaptive-grid technique for time dependent (as well as time independent) problems in one spatial dimension, which automatically detects, resolves and tracks all essential features in the solution. Our method is demonstrated on two examples in fluid dynamics: (1) the generation and propagation of a front in two-phase immiscible flow described by the Buckley-Leverett equation, and (2) the classical Riemann problem of ideal gas dynamics.},

This change may be detected and used for stress diagnosis if the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently large. Under midday conditions, when water stress is likely to occur, the greenhouse is often ventilated, resulting in a rather small signal-to-noise ratio. It is suggested here that the signal level may be increased by exciting the system, namely by suspending the ventilation for a short period of time. The transient response of temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration to the abrupt change of ventilation may be monitored, analysed and compared to a modelled normal response for the same greenhouse with an unstressed crop. A significant discrepancy between the two would indicate that the crop is stressed. Lawn, serving as a crop substitute, has been submitted to several irrigation–drought sequences in a small experimental greenhouse. Each day, in the early afternoon, ventilation was suspended for three periods of 30min each. Differences in the response of CO2 concentration enabled the detection of all stress periods as soon as the rate of transpiration decreased to below normal. The humidity response was slightly less sensitive, and the temperature response was the least sensitive. Water-stress detection via the excitation method was considerably better than detection based on observations at full ventilation.},

The shift of red-edge position (REP) of vegetation reflectance spectra, which is a focus point of derivative spectrum analysis, has been studied by many researchers as an indicator of environmental stresses and LAI. However, it is less satisfactory at canopy level than at leaf level. A field experiment was conducted, using 3-year-old potted Quercus glauca and Q. serrata, to examine the utility of derivative spectrum analysis for detecting drought status and LAI at canopy level and to find the optimal bands that can independently detect those variables. Five levels of drought status (including a control) and three levels of LAI were set. Measurements were made of canopy reflectance spectra at approximately 3nm intervals, xylem water potentials, leaf water contents and LAI. Two measures for representing high or low drought status were chosen. One was water-cessation duration in hours (WD) and the other was leaf water content (LWC). They corresponded to a gradual change and an abrupt change, respectively, during drought development. The results showed that REP and REP-relevant indices were not very successful for independent detection of WD, LWC or LAI at canopy level. The best single bands for detecting WD, LWC and LAI were 611.4nm in the first derivative (r=0.807), 519.6nm in the first derivative (r=0.916) and 676.0nm in the second derivative (r=0.828), respectively. The initial part of the red-edge peak was a better indicator than the top (i.e. REP or the first derivative at REP) for the independent detection of LAI. A simulation to test lower spectral resolution proved that the wavelengths at 10nm intervals that approximated the desirable bands at 3nm intervals retained similar correlation coefficients for the three variables.},

	abstract = {Understanding how communities change with time since fire is critical for identifying appropriate fire return intervals for biodiversity conservation. In infrequently-burnt communities, vegetation structure, habitat features and fuel availability can change over time-scales much longer than can be measured using contemporary remote-sensing approaches, creating challenges for conservation and fire management. To characterize longer-term patterns of vegetation structural change, we measured vegetation cover, ground cover, tree density and stand basal area across a multi-century time-since-fire sequence derived from growth ring-size relationships in fire-sensitive Eucalyptus salubris woodlands of south-western Australia. We hypothesized that: (i) vegetation structural components reflecting fuel availability increase with time since fire; (ii) recovery of vegetation structural components with time since fire requires long time-frames; and (iii) vegetation components indicating senescence are more evident in mature than intermediate fire-age classes. All vegetation structural components showed significant differences between time-since-fire classes (termed ‘young’, ‘intermediate’ and ‘mature’), and to a lesser extent between years of sampling. The two vegetation structural components with the highest covers overall, and hence likely greatest contributors to fuel availability, were vegetation 4–10m high and ground fuel. These two layers showed non-monotonic changes indicating a peak at intermediate times since fire (∼35–150 or 35–250years; depending on the model used to estimate stand age), conflicting with the common assumption that fuel availability increases with time since fire. Total stand basal area increased rapidly after fire then appeared to stabilize beyond about 100years, with competition likely mediating density-dependent thinning such that declining plant density offset increasing trunk size. There was little evidence for an increase in standing dead vegetation in mature woodlands such as would suggest significant senescence when long-unburnt. Replacement of mature woodlands with intermediate time-since-fire woodlands with greater cover and connectivity of key fuel layers potentially instigates a self-reinforcing fire regime shift favouring larger and/or more uniform fires. If such changes eventuate, substantial losses in conservation values in E. salubris woodlands are likely. Elucidating these changes in vegetation structure and implications for conservation management only became feasible due to the development of methods to estimate the time since fire of vegetation not burnt for hundreds of years.},

	abstract = {Simulation models for foam enhanced oil recovery are of two types: those that treat foam texture or bubble size explicitly (population-balance models) and those that treat the effects of foam texture implicitly through a gas mobility-reduction factor. The implicit-texture models all implicitly assume local equilibrium (LE) between the processes of foam creation and destruction. In published studies most population-balance models predict rapid attainment of local-equilibrium as well, and some have been recast in LE versions. In this paper we compare population-balance and implicit-texture (IT) models in two ways. First, we show the equivalence of the two approaches by deriving explicitly the foam texture and foam-coalescence-rate function implicit in the IT models, and then show its similarity to that in population-balance models. Second, we compare the models based on their ability to represent a set of N2 and CO2 steady-state foam experiments and discuss the corresponding parameters of the different methods. Each of the IT models examined was equivalent to the LE formulation of a population-balance model with a lamella-destruction function that increases abruptly in the vicinity of the limiting capillary pressure Pc*, as in current population-balance models. The relation between steady-state foam texture and water saturation or capillary pressure implicit in the IT models is essentially the same as that in the population-balance models. The IT and population-balance models match the experimental data presented equally well. The IT models examined allow for flexibility in making the abruptness of the coalescence rate near Pc* an adjustable parameter. Some allow for coarse foam to survive at high capillary pressure, and allow for a range of power-law non-Newtonian behavior in the low-quality regime. Thus the IT models that incorporate an abrupt change in foam properties near a given water saturation can be recast as LE versions of corresponding population-balance models with a lamella-destruction function similar to those in current PB models. The trends in dimensionless foam texture implicit in the IT models is similar to that in the PB models. In other words, both types of model, at least in the LE approximation, equally honor the physics of foam behavior in porous media.},

Selecting the optimum or best punch-die clearance can give a significantly longer tool life by minimizing tool wear. Previous studies have shown the effect of punch-die clearance on various sheet materials and thicknesses during blanking of round parts while non-round geometries are more commonly found in industrial applications. Therefore, in this study, the effect of part geometry is considered to select the ‘best’ punch-die clearance to minimize tool wear. In blanking non-round geometries, the punch and die undergo non-uniform wear, with higher wear observed in areas with sharp radii and abrupt changes in geometry. In the present study, the effect of punch-die clearance on punch stress for blanking various shapes is investigated using Finite Element (FE) analysis. The punch-die clearance that gives the lowest value of the punch stress for the different part geometries is identified. A method is developed to select a geometry dependent variable punch-die clearance to obtain more uniform wear on the punch, thereby increasing the punch and die life.},

	abstract = {Information on soil spatial variability is important for optimal management of agricultural and natural resources. Systematic studies to characterize and quantify soil spatial variability have identified various issues including sale dependence and anisotropy. In this research, we have introduced curvelet transform to characterize scale-dependent anisotropic soil spatial variation. The new curvelet transform is a multi-scale transform with strong directional sensitivity. It separates overall variations in soil properties in to a number of spatial scales and directions. It combines multiple methods including wavelet and ridgelet transforms. The curvelet transform is ideally suited for the presentation of soil variability information containing abrupt values or displaying discontinuity in its spatial distribution. Spatial variability in soil potassium (K) measured using airborne radiometric survey was characterized using the curvelet transform and is presented as a case study. Soil K data from radiometric survey is often used to characterize soil and its properties. Overall variation in soil K was separated and quantified at different scales and directions, which were indicative of the scales of different landscape modification processes and their directions. Percent contribution towards the total variance at different scales and directions indicated the importance of those processes that modified the landscape. The curvelet transform provided explicit information at different scales and directions to understand the variability in landscape processes in the study area. The spatial variability information at a wide range of scales, locations, and directions can also be used in multi-scale directional soil mapping, scale specific prediction of soil properties, and filtering, smoothing and denoising of satellite derived data.},

	abstract = {Engineered monolayers created using microabrasion and micropatterning methods have provided a simplified in vitro system to study the effects of anisotropy and fiber direction on electrical propagation. Interpreting the behavior in these culture systems has often been performed using classical computer models with continuous properties. However, such models do not account for the effects of random cell shapes, cell orientations, and cleft spaces inherent in these monolayers on the resulting wavefront conduction. This work presents a novel methodology for modeling a monolayer of cardiac tissue in which the factors governing cell shape, cell-to-cell coupling, and degree of cleft space are not constant but rather are treated as spatially random with assigned distributions. This modeling approach makes it possible to simulate wavefront propagation in a manner analogous to performing experiments on engineered monolayer tissues. Simulated results are compared to previously published measured data from monolayers used to investigate the role of cellular architecture on conduction velocities and anisotropy ratios. We also present an estimate for obtaining the electrical properties from these networks and demonstrate how variations in the discrete cellular architecture affect the macroscopic conductivities. The simulations support the common assumption that under normal ranges of coupling strength, tissues with relatively uniform distributions of cell shapes and connectivity can be represented using continuous models with conductivities derived from random discrete cellular architecture using either global or local estimates. The results also reveal that in the presence of abrupt changes in cell orientation, local estimates of tissue properties predict smoother changes in conductivity that may not adequately predict the discrete nature of propagation at the transition sites.},

A bank of adaptive unscented Kalman filters (AUKFs) is used as a core of FDI module. The AUKF approach alleviates the inflexibility of the conventional UKF due to constant covariance set up, leading to probable divergence. A fuzzy-based decision making (FDM) algorithm is introduced to diagnose sensor and/or actuator faults. The proposed FDI approach is utilized to recursively correct the measurement vector and the model used for both state estimation and output prediction in a model predictive control (MPC) formulation. Robustness of the proposed FTC system, H∞ optimal robust controller and MPC are combined via a fuzzy switch that is used for switching between MPC and robust controller such that FTC system is able to maintain the offset free behavior in the face of abrupt changes in model parameters and unmeasured disturbances. This methodology is applied on benchmark three-tank system; the proposed FTC approach facilitates recovery of the closed loop performance after the faults have been isolated leading to an offset free behavior in the presence of sensor/actuator faults that can be either abrupt or drift change in biases. Analysis of the simulation results reveals that the proposed approach provides an effective method for treating faults (biases/drifts in sensors/actuators, changes in model parameters and unmeasured disturbances) under the unified framework of robust fault tolerant control.},

In this study drawing on the method of conversation analysis, actual interactions between therapists and their patients have been video taped and analysed in detail. The present study describes and analyses three types of empathy that can be identified in actual sequences of talk; cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and sharing empathy. These types of empathy are higher level conversational resources that build on the more basic resources, such as questions, assertions, and other types of utterances and non-verbal behaviour. When empathy is expressed, the patient should receive by responding appropriately to the therapist's prior utterance. This receipt may involve answering questions, agreeing with assertions, demonstrating understanding, and appropriate showing of feelings. A lack of proper receipt by the patient is oriented to by the interactants and may result in signs of conversational failure, such as reformulations, pausing, and an abrupt change of topic.},

The non-parametric Mann–Kendall statistic was used to identify change trends and points in the annual streamflow in the Hun–Tai River basin in northeast China. The identifications were based on streamflow records from six hydrological stations during 1961–2006, and the purpose was to analyze the change characteristics of the hydrological processes. The results indicated that all hydrological stations presented downward trends in annual streamflows. Abrupt changes in the annual streamflow occurred around 1978 in the Hun River basin, and around 1998 in the Taizi River basin. The impact of climate variability on the mean annual streamflow was also analyzed based on the relationships among streamflow, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration. Precipitation and meteorological data from 22 rainfall stations and 10 weather stations within the basin were employed in the analysis. Daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the Penman–Monteith equation. Climate variability was estimated to account for 43\% of the reduction in the annual streamflow, and human activities accounted for about 57\%.},

Typical core-annulus flow structure and non-uniform distribution of solid holdup appear in the riser. The inside and outside swirling flows of gas motion as well as the fishtailing phenomenon are captured in the cyclone. The solid residence time in the riser shows an early-occurred peak with a long tail. In the riser, details related to solid motion at the particle-scale level are obtained.

Nevertheless, reliable methods for detecting these niche shifts from consumption data are limited. In this study we present a new approach for the detection and analysis of ontogenetic diet shifts, based on complex network theory. As a case study, we apply these methods to the endangered, small fish Aphanius iberus. The stage-structured consumer population and its set of consumed prey are represented as an unweighted bipartite network. A statistical evaluation of the resulting network structure permits to uncover empirical patterns of ontogenetic diet shifts. We test for changes in niche breadth, as well as nestedness and diet modularity along ontogeny. These tests were carried out on the subnetworks describing consumption, positive electivity, and negative electivity on prey items. The statistical significance was established by means of null model analyses. Our analyses reveal a nested diet, along with a gradual decrease in diet breadth and a modular structure (i.e. abrupt changes) of elected preys along the ontogeny of A. iberus. The detection of network structure by means of the use of tools from complex network theory is shown to be a promising method for studying ontogenetic niche shifts.},

	abstract = {Studies of development and change in partisan fortunes in the US emphasize epochs of partisan stability, separated by critical events or turning points. In this paper we study partisan electoral changes in the US Congress using the method of Markov switching. Our estimates are based on election changes from 1854, roughly the date of the establishment of the modern incarnation of the two-party system, to the present. For the Senate, we estimate partisan balance both from 1856 and from 1914, the period of direct elections. Our discrete-state method performs better than one based on smooth cycles, and is more consistent with the existing theory. We use the Markov switching method to estimate an underlying unobserved state parameter, ‘partisan regime’. The method allows the direct estimation of critical transition points between Republican and Democratic partisan coalitions. Republican regimes characterized House elections during three periods: 1860 through 1872, 1894 through 1906, and 1918 through 1928. Senate results were roughly similar. Every recession caused a realignment prior to 1932, but since then none has. For the Senate, the two-state model does not fit adequately. We estimate a three-state model in which a Republican regime dominated from 1914 through 1928; a Democratic regime characterized the period 1930–1934, and a Democratic-leaning regime characterized the period 1938 to the present (1936 is a transition year). The driver for historical realignments up to 1930 seems to have been economic distress, at least for the House. Each recession before 1930 is associated with a realignment, but after 1930, no recession produced a realignment. Since then, however, economic downturns have not led to realignments. We speculate that better economic management since World War II, resulting in shallower recessions, is the cause. For the Senate, however, we detect only one fundamental regime shift: that during the Great Depression.},

	abstract = {Summary Drought severity and related socio-economic impacts are expected to increase due to climate change. To better adapt to these impacts, more knowledge on changes in future hydrological drought characteristics (e.g. frequency, duration) is needed rather than only knowledge on changes in meteorological or soil moisture drought characteristics. In this study, effects of climate change on droughts in several river basins across the globe were investigated. Downscaled and bias-corrected data from three General Circulation Models (GCMs) for the A2 emission scenario were used as forcing for large-scale models. Results from five large-scale hydrological models (GHMs) run within the EU-WATCH project were used to identify low flows and hydrological drought characteristics in the control period (1971–2000) and the future period (2071–2100). Low flows were defined by the monthly 20th percentile from discharge (Q20). The variable threshold level method was applied to determine hydrological drought characteristics. The climatology of normalized Q20 from model results for the control period was compared with the climatology of normalized Q20 from observed discharge of the Global Runoff Data Centre. An observation-constrained selection of model combinations (GHM and GCM) was made based on this comparison. Prior to the assessment of future change, the selected model combinations were evaluated against observations in the period 2001–2010 for a number of river basins. The majority of the combinations (82\%) that performed sufficiently in the control period, also performed sufficiently in the period 2001–2010. With the selected model combinations, future changes in drought for each river basin were identified. In cold climates, model combinations projected a regime shift and increase in low flows between the control period and future period. Arid climates were found to become even drier in the future by all model combinations. Agreement between the combinations on future low flows was low in humid climates. Changes in hydrological drought characteristics relative to the control period did not correspond to changes in low flows in all river basins. In most basins (around 65\%), drought duration and deficit were projected to increase by the majority of the selected model combinations, while a decrease in low flows was projected in less basins (around 51\%). Even if low discharge (monthly Q20) was not projected to decrease for each month, droughts became more severe, for example in some basins in cold climates. This is partly caused by the use of the threshold of the control period to determine drought events in the future, which led to unintended droughts in terms of expected impacts. It is important to consider both low discharge and hydrological drought characteristics to anticipate on changes in droughts for implementation of correct adaptation measures to safeguard future water resources.},

Biotic processes that consume atmospheric CO2 and create organic carbon (C) that is either reprocessed to CO2 or stored in soils, are the subject of active current investigations with great concern over the influence of climate change. In addition, abiotic C cycling and its influence on the inorganic C pool in soils is a fundamental global process in which acidic atmospheric CO2 participates in the weathering of carbonate and silicate minerals, ultimately delivering bicarbonate and Ca2+ or other cations that precipitate in the form of carbonates in soils or are transported to the rivers, lakes, and oceans. Soil responses to climate change will be complex, and there are many uncertainties and unresolved issues. The objective of the review is to initiate and further stimulate a discussion about some important and challenging aspects of climate-change effects on soils, such as accelerated weathering of soil minerals and resulting C and elemental fluxes in and out of soils, soil/geo-engineering methods used to increase C sequestration in soils, soil organic matter (SOM) protection, transformation and mineralization, and SOM temperature sensitivity.

	abstract = {This paper presents a time domain system identification (SI) scheme for detection of sudden structural damage that occurs during an earthquake. A moving time window technique is proposed to trace abrupt changes in the structural parameters caused by sudden damage. The time window represents a finite time interval, in which the SI procedures are performed assuming time-invariant system parameters. As the time window moves forward, the variation of system parameters in time is identified. The error function is defined as the time integral of the squared errors between measured accelerations and calculated accelerations by a mathematical model. Structural damping is approximated by the Rayleigh damping model, and damping properties as well as stiffness properties of a structure are considered as system parameters. A regularization technique is adopted to alleviate the ill-posed characteristics of SI problems. In the formulation of a new regularization function in time domain, a weighting factor is introduced to balance the relative regularization effect between stiffness and damping parameters. A truncated singular value decomposition scheme is applied to impose the regularization function on the minimization of the error function. Numerical simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Background Frequently, radiologists emphasize radiographic transition zones (RTZs) on computed tomography (CT), which are areas of abrupt change from dilated to collapsed bowel, as pathognomonic for small-bowel obstruction (SBO) diagnosis and location. The relevance of RTZs to patient management remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the surgical predictive value and intraoperative accuracy of RTZ. Methods A retrospective review of 200 patients with SBO who underwent abdominal CT at a single institution from 2002 to 2007 was performed. Statistical analysis was conducted using an unpaired t test, a Chi-square test, and multivariate analysis. Results Of the 200 patients with SBO, 150 (75\%) had an RTZ. Seventy-five (38\%) patients required operative intervention; 58 (39\%) patients had RTZ and 17 (34\%) patients did not have RTZ (P=NS). The presence of RTZ was not associated with increased probability of operative versus nonoperative management (odds ratio=1.19; 95\% confidence interval [0.61–2.32]). The mean time to operative intervention was 3.6 days. Immediate operative intervention ({\textless}24h) was equivalent in patients with versus without RTZ (57\% vs 53\%; P=NS) as was intervention for failed nonoperative management (43\% vs 47\%; P=NS). For patients who required operative intervention, RTZ correlated with intraoperative site of obstruction in only 31 (63\%) patients. Conclusion The presence of RTZs does not increase the likelihood of operative intervention or identify patients who will fail nonoperative management. RTZ should, therefore, not be used as a major criterion influencing operative versus nonoperative management decisions in patients with SBO. For patients who required operative intervention, RTZ had a 63\% correlation with intra-operative findings, which makes it a useful adjunct to pre-operative planning.},

	abstract = {The physical properties of membranes derived from the total lipids extracted from the lens cortex and nucleus of a 2-year-old cow were investigated using EPR spin-labeling methods. Conventional EPR spectra and saturation–recovery curves show that spin labels detect a single homogenous environment in membranes made from cortical lipids. Properties of these membranes are very similar to those reported by us for membranes made of the total lipid extract of 6-month-old calf lenses (J. Widomska, M. Raguz, J. Dillon, E. R. Gaillard, W. K. Subczynski, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1768 (2007) 1454–1465). However, in membranes made from nuclear lipids, two domains were detected by the EPR discrimination by oxygen transport method using the cholesterol analogue spin label and were assigned to the bulk phospholipid–cholesterol domain (PCD) and the immiscible cholesterol crystalline domain (CCD), respectively. Profiles of the order parameter, hydrophobicity, and the oxygen transport parameter are practically identical in the bulk PCD when measured for either the cortical or nuclear lipid membranes. In both membranes, lipids in the bulk PCD are strongly immobilized at all depths. Hydrophobicity and oxygen transport parameter profiles have a rectangular shape with an abrupt change between the C9 and C10 positions, which is approximately where the steroid ring structure of cholesterol reaches into the membrane. The permeability coefficient for oxygen, estimated at 35 °C, across the bulk PCD in both membranes is slightly lower than across the water layer of the same thickness. However, the evaluated upper limit of the permeability coefficient for oxygen across the CCD (34.4 cm/s) is significantly lower than across the water layer of the same thickness (85.9 cm/s), indicating that the CCD can significantly reduce oxygen transport in the lens nucleus.},

In ancient pelagic and hemipelagic strata, the identification of relatively short hiatus (103–106 years) is commonly challenged by the resolution limits of geochronologic techniques. In this study, a quantitative method is developed to identify and quantify hiatuses in strata where Milankovitch orbital cycles are documented. The new method is based on the interpretation of evolutive harmonic analysis (EHA) results and permits estimation of minimum durations for the temporal gaps. Application of this technique to an optical densitometry data series derived from the Cenomanian/Turonian (C/T) Bridge Creek Limestone Member permits quantification of hiatus within the unit and addresses important questions about abrupt changes in biogeochemical proxy records across the boundary interval. Integration of the new method with stratigraphic data and geochemical burial flux estimates permits a detailed reconstruction of the controls on sediment delivery and hiatus generation, including a refined analysis of the orbital-scale linkages between climate and sedimentation.},

	abstract = {Online state classification of PEM fuel cell systems is a challenging task. While electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the measurement of the 1kHz impedance, cyclic voltammetry, and the polarisation curve are the state-of-the-art in laboratory testing, it is hardly possible to install these analytic methods in application-oriented fuel cell systems. The necessary technical equipment is expensive, and hybridisation would be essential to create artificial operating conditions necessary during the measurement. A more economic solution for online state classification is the integration of a real-time model-based state classifier. A model, operating in parallel to the fuel cell, is able to provide extra information about the fuel cell such as the humidity of the membrane, which is not measurable in situ. On the other hand, online comparison of measurement data with the theoretical calculation allows us to detect malfunction of components. Based on a detailed model and a complex classification database, including error states of the system, it is possible to classify the state of a fuel cell or detect system errors. The voltage drift between classical physical models and a real fuel cell caused by irreversible degradation (platinum diversion, membrane thinning, carbon corrosion) and reversible degradation (contamination) is not yet completely understood, and therefore modelling so far remains imprecise. To avoid the misinterpretation caused by these constantly growing differences between the model and the reality, the described modelling approach has been focused on dynamic fuel cell reactions. Dynamic step responses of the fuel cell for abruptly changing operation conditions are being simulated in real time. The changing operation conditions may result from a real load cycle or, as for theses analyses, by forced stoichiometric steps. The comparison of the real and the simulated step responses is the basis for the state classifier and the controller to react. A conclusion of the series of measurement is shown, the model and its parameters are presented, and the opportunities of the state classifier and controller are discussed in this paper.},

Standard tests, like JEDEC 78, which apply quasi-static overvoltage and overcurrent may fail to identify this susceptibility. The presented test method and setup allows to study the transient induced latch-up (TLU) phenomenon employing nstrigger impulses at wafer-level and package-level. A TLU-module superimposes the DC voltage of the power supply with a short stress pulse and delivers the combination to the tested pin of the DUT, avoiding destructive EOS. Closest possible distances between the TLU-module and the DUT and the use of RF-probes at wafer level allow risetimes of less than 1 ns, time resolved measurements of voltage and current, and an almost instantaneous limitation of the supply current after latch-up has been triggered. The short stress pulses were generated by transmission lines or solid state pulse generators. Abrupt changes in the voltage and current amplitudes indicate that latch-up has been triggered. The method is successfully demonstrated for several devices in different technologies.},

The results demonstrated: (1) the annual ET0 displayed a statistically significant decrease of −10.3 mm/10 y (P {\textless} 0.05) during 1961–2012. At that time, AI also had a decreasing trend of −0.013/10 y over the past 52 years. Compared with ET0, the inter-decadal variations of AI over the LPR seemed to show similar declined trends. (2) Spatially, about 81\% stations displayed a decreasing trend for annual ET0 during 1961–2012, and most of them were distributed in the western, northern and southeastern LPR. In addition, about 60\% of stations showed statistically decreasing trends for AI, and the major decreases were mainly in the east Qinghai division and northern LPR. (3) Abrupt changes were detected in annual ET0 series in the 1980s and in annual AI series in 1987. Wavelet analysis indicated significant 2 year and non-significant 7, 10 and 14 years in annual ET0 series, and there existed periods of 4, 8 and 12 years for AI. (4) For ET0, wind speed was the most sensitive meteorological factor, followed by sunshine hours, precipitation, and relative humidity. For AI, ET0 and precipitation were the sensitive factors.

	abstract = {Classical applications of control engineering and information and communication technology (ICT) in production and logistics are often done in a rigid, centralized and hierarchical way. These inflexible approaches are typically not able to cope with the complexities of the manufacturing environment, such as the instabilities, uncertainties and abrupt changes caused by internal and external disturbances, or a large number and variety of interacting, interdependent elements. A paradigm shift, e.g., novel organizing principles and methods, is needed for supporting the interoperability of dynamic alliances of agile and networked systems. Several solution proposals argue that the future of manufacturing and logistics lies in network-like, dynamic, open and reconfigurable systems of cooperative autonomous entities. The paper overviews various distributed approaches and technologies of control engineering and ICT that can support the realization of cooperative structures from the resource level to the level of networked enterprises. Standard results as well as recent advances from control theory, through cooperative game theory, distributed machine learning to holonic systems, cooperative enterprise modeling, system integration, and autonomous logistics processes are surveyed. A special emphasis is put on the theoretical developments and industrial applications of Robustly Feasible Model Predictive Control (RFMPC). Two case studies are also discussed: (i) a holonic, PROSA-based approach to generate short-term forecasts for an additive manufacturing system by means of a delegate multi-agent system (D-MAS); and (ii) an application of distributed RFMPC to a drinking water distribution system.},

We first tested the SSA based filtering algorithm on synthetic seismic data and then applied to real seismic reflection data from Singareni coalfields, Andhra Pradesh, India. The individual trace from each channel in the shot gathers is processed and compared with Fourier and multichannel SSA filtered output.

	abstract = {We examine the two-dimensional, steady flow of a viscoelastic film under the action of gravity over a substrate with periodic topographical features. We account for the rheology of the viscoelastic material using the exponential Phan–Thien and Tanner (PTT) constitutive model. The conservation equations are solved via the mixed finite element method combined with a quasi-elliptic grid generation scheme, while the viscoelastic stresses are discretized using the EVSS-G/SUPG method. Our scheme allows the computation of accurate steady-state solutions up to high values of Deborah, Reynolds and capillary numbers. We perform a thorough parametric analysis to investigate the effect of the elastic, capillary and inertia forces on the flow characteristics. Our results indicate that surface tension and elasticity affect the film closer to the location with abrupt changes of the substrate topography; the sizes of the capillary ridge before a step down and of the depression before a step up are increased and move upstream as fluid elasticity or interfacial tension increase. It is shown that under creeping flow conditions the length scale of the capillary ridge increases with De following a power law of ¼, which can also be predicted by simple scaling arguments. Inertia has a more global effect on the film affecting larger portions of it, while in its presence the length scale of the capillary features is not affected significantly by the material elasticity. Moreover, it is shown that similarly to the case of Newtonian liquids, high inertia causes the formation of a ridge just after the step up. We also explore the effect of the geometrical characteristics of the substrate as well as its inclination angle and it is shown that the interface shape becomes more deformed as the topography appears wider, deeper or it approaches the vertical plane.},

The numerical results clearly indicate that all stress components vary significantly near the ends. An abrupt change of the shear stresses is thus predicted close to the edges.

In the thresholding approach, a feature is calculated in consecutive windows, and the resulted index is tracked over time and compared with a threshold. The moment the index crosses the threshold is considered as the moment of seizure onset. In the classification approach, features are extracted from before, during, and after ictal periods and statistically analyzed. Statistical characteristics of some features have a significant difference among these periods, thus resulting in epileptic seizure detection. Results Several features were examined in the thresholding approach. Nonlinear energy and coastline features were successful in epileptic seizure detection. The best result was achieved by the coastline feature, which led to a mean of a 2-second delay in its correct detections. In the classification approach, the best result was achieved using the fuzzy similarity index that led to Pvalue{\textless}0.001. Conclusion This study showed that variance-based features were more appropriate for tracking abrupt changes in ECoG signals. Therefore, these features perform better in seizure onset estimation, whereas nonlinear features or indices, which are based on dynamical systems, can better track the transition of neural system to ictal period. Significance This paper presents examination of different features and indices for detection of induced epileptic seizures from rat's ECoG signals.},

	abstract = {Ultrafiltration method for measuring vascular access flow rates during hemodialysis. Background The vascular access blood flow rate (QA) has been shown to be an important predictor of vascular access failure; therefore, the routine measurement of QA may prove to be a useful clinical method of vascular access assessment. Methods We have developed a new ultrafiltration (UF) method for determining QA during HD from changes in arterial hematocrit (H) after abrupt changes in the UF rate with the dialysis blood lines in the normal (δHn) and reverse (δHr) configurations. This method accounts for cardiopulmonary recirculation and requires neither intravenous saline injections nor accurate knowledge of the dialyzer blood flow rate. Clinical studies were conducted in 65 chronic HD patients from three different dialysis programs to compare QA determined by the UF method with that determined by saline dilution using an ultrasound flow sensor. Results Arterial H increased (P {\textless} 0.0001) after abrupt increases in the UF rate when the lines were in the normal and reverse configurations. An increase in the UF rate from the minimum setting to 1.8 liter/hr resulted in a δHn of 0.3 ± 0.2 (mean ±SD) H units and a δHr of 1.6 ± 1.0 H units. QA values determined by the UF method (1050 ± 460 ml/min) were 16 ± 25\% higher (P {\textless} 0.001) than those determined by saline dilution (950 ± 440 ml/min); the calculated QA values by the UF and saline dilution methods correlated highly with each other (R = 0.92, P {\textless} 0.0001). The average coefficient of variation for duplicate measurements of QA determined by the UF method in a subset of these patients (N = 21) was approximately 10\% when assessed in either the same dialysis session or consecutive sessions. Conclusions The results from this study show that changes in arterial H after abrupt changes in the UF rate can be used to assess QA.},

	abstract = {Objective: To compare the findings in computed tomography (CT) and small bowel enema (SBE) in clinically equivocal small bowel obstruction in order to identify the reasons for the limitation of CT evaluation. Subject and Method: Over a period of 5 years, 49 patients who had both CT and SBE within a period of 1 week were analysed. The findings at SBE were categorized into partial low-grade, partial high-grade and complete obstruction and compared with the CT findings. A critical analysis of the CT false-negative cases was made. The predictive values for the determination of the presence of obstruction in CT were also obtained. Results: Forty-three out of the 49 patients had proven intestinal obstruction. CT correctly identified 34 cases including 19 of 20 with partial high-grade obstruction, two with complete obstruction and 13 out of 21 cases of partial low-grade obstruction. Among those case with low-grade obstruction cases with complex or long segment narrowing or with masses were correctly identified while six patients with short stenotic segment due to various causes were not. CT also had two false-positive findings of obstruction in patients with mesenteric infarction. SBE had neither false positive nor false negative. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values for CT were 83\%, 67\%, 94\% and 36\%, respectively. Abrupt transition from dilated to collapsed loops in CT were caused by various intraluminal lesions apart from adhesions. CT was superior to SBE in showing extraluminal masses, revealing abscesses, tuberculous lesions and malignancy anterior adhesions as well as features of strangulation. Conclusion: Apart from degree of obstruction and the presence of masses, the length of the stenotic part also affected CT detection. Abrupt change from dilated to collapsed segment could be due to various transmural and intraluminal lesions although adhesions was the commonest lesion. While SBE is more accurate in identifying the presence and location of obstruction, CT is superior for detection of the cause of small bowel obstruction and also for the presence of strangulation. In places where CT is more widely used for intestinal, obstruction, SBE evaluation could be prudently considered in CT negative cases of clinically equivocal intestinal obstruction.},

	abstract = {Objectives. We have observed sensing errors in third generation implantable cardioverter-defibrillators that appear to be caused by variation in the R wave amplitude during sinus rhythm, particularly after premature beats. The purpose of this study was to quantify spontaneous R wave variability during sinus rhythm and to determine whether abrupt changes in cycle length further augment R wave amplitude variability. Background, Pacemaker sensing algorithms presume a relatively constant R wave signal to establish a sensing threshold. The concept of a fixed sensing threshold is not as applicable in third-generation cardioverter-defibrillators, which depend on automatic gain amplifiers to rapidly detect ventricular fibrillation. These devices may be susceptible to undersensing during sinus rhythm if significant variability in R wave signal characteristics occurs. Methods. Twelve patients with combination bradycardia pacing cardioverter-defibrillators were studied. The device used (Cadence, Ventritex) allowed recording of real time, telemetered electrograms from the sensing lead system. Measurements were made of the maximal range of the R wave amplitude during sinus rhythm and in response to abrupt changes in heart rate produced by premature atrial and ventricular stimuli. Results. The maximal range in R wave amplitude during sinus rhythm was 1.7 ± 1.3 mV, or 23.7 ± 19.2\% of the mean R wave amplitude. The R wave amplitude variability increased with abrupt changes in cycle length, with a range of 2.8 ± 1.5 mV, or 38.8 ± 18.3\% of the mean R wave amplitude (p {\textless} 0.05 compared with sinus rhythm). In most patients, R wave amplitude and coupling interval demonstrated an inverse proportional relation. Conclusions. There is substantial variability in the R wave amplitude during sinus rhythm measured by permanent ventricular sensing lead systems, and this variability is further augmented by abrupt changes in cycle length. This phenomenon may explain the occurrence of undersensing of sinus rhythm in implantable cardioverter-defibrillators with automatic gain sense amplifiers.},

Almost all methods have shown overall accuracies higher than 85\% instead of 80.8\% for models based on physicochemical parameters. The present result points to a acceptable robustness of the Markov model for different truncation schemes and roff values.

	abstract = {The crashes in financial markets have caught the attention of many researchers since 1929 and several mathematical models have been proposed to try to forecast the occurrence of these events. The main idea in this work is to use a wavelet transform to detect imminent abrupt changes in a financial time series, which may be eventually related to the possibility of a crash. Case studies are conducted using wavelet approaches with data covering pre-crash and post-crash 1929, as well as more recent Hang Seng and IBOVESPA data. The financial crisis of 2008 also is analyzed using this method. These time series provide useful insights into the behavior of wavelet coefficients under the possibility of short term crashes in stock market. However, it is not a trivial task to infer an imminent drawdown by simply examining the pattern of the wavelet transform coefficients. Hence, an index (a real number between 0 and 1) is proposed to aggregate the information provided by the wavelet coefficients. The new index presented good capability of monitoring crashes and drawdown with small error margins, at least in the studied cases.},

The approach is based on Kalman filtering to model linear portions of on-line handwritten, particularly, handwritten numerals, and to detect abrupt changes in handwritten direction underlying a model change. This approach uses a Kalman filter framework constrained by a normalized line equation, where quadratic terms are linearized through a first-order Taylor expansion. The modeling is then carried out under the assumption that the state is deterministic and time-invariant, while the detection relies on double thresholding mechanism which tests for a violation of this assumption. The first threshold is based on an approach of layout kinetics. The second one takes into account the jump in angle between the past observed direction of layout and its current direction. The method proposed enables real-time processing. To illustrate the methodology proposed, some results obtained from handwritten numerals are presented.},

	abstract = {Summary The spatial distribution and temporal trends for actual evapotranspiration (ETa) reflect the combined effects of the climate, soil and vegetation. This study was conducted to investigate the influence of climatic change on ETa. Using the simple two-parameter steady-state model (SPS model), ETa was calculated from precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (ETp) at 89 meteorological stations during 1961–2006 in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China. The spatial distribution of ETa was performed by means of Kriging method, and the temporal trends of ETa were investigated by the least squares linear model (linear fitted model), the Mann–Kendall method (the M–K method), Kendall τ statistical method (Kendall τ method) and the causes for the variations were discussed by means of the ‘detrended method’ and SPS model. The results presented that: (i) the spatial distribution of ETa, as most of the YRB is water-limited, presented a similar spatial pattern with precipitation, which demonstrates decreasing trends from southeast to northwest; (ii) negative trends for ETa were detected by both the linear fitted model and Kendall τ method, and significant decreasing trends (at 95\% confidence level) were detected in all regions of YRB; (iii) the timings of abrupt changes detected by the M–K method was 1991, 1979, 1975 and 1978 in the upper, middle, lower region and whole YRB, respectively, and so the ETa during 1961–2006 was divided into two periods: natural period and changed period (e.g. natural period (1961–1990) and changed period (1991–2006) in the upper region); and (iv) the influence of climatic change on ETa contributed to −3.10×109m3, −4.26×109m3, −15.68×109m3 and −16.62×109m3 between natural period and changed period in the upper region, middle region, lower region and whole basin of YRB, respectively. The trends of ETa, ETp and precipitation reflected that ETa is controlled by precipitation rather than ETp, especially the results presented an evidence for the Bouchet’s complementary hypothesis in the middle region of YRB.},

A clinical decision support system that exploits the subbands’ textural fractal characteristics for best bases selection of meningioma brain histopathological image classification is proposed. Each subband is analysed using its fractal dimension instead of energy, which has the advantage of being less sensitive to image intensity and abrupt changes in tissue texture. The most significant subband that best identifies texture discontinuities will be chosen for further decomposition, and its fractal characteristics would represent the optimal feature vector for classification. The performance was tested using the support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian and k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classifiers and a leave-one-patient-out method was employed for validation. Our method outperformed the classical energy based selection approaches, achieving for SVM, Bayesian and kNN classifiers an overall classification accuracy of 94.12\%, 92.50\% and 79.70\%, as compared to 86.31\%, 83.19\% and 51.63\% for the co-occurrence matrix, and 76.01\%, 73.50\% and 50.69\% for the energy texture signatures; respectively.

Aims To analyze demographic, health-related and other characteristics associated with suicidal behavior as well as motives and methods of suicide. Methods Data were extracted from relevant documentation (medical records, public health reports, etc.) and statistically processed upon collection. Results Majority of suicide victims were males between 45 and 64 years while most suicide attempts occurred among 18–29 years old females. Leading method of suicide was hanging, followed by jumping from high places and use of firearm. Prevailing suicidal motives were psychotic symptoms, serious somatic illnesses and family problems. Depression accounted for 25\% of all suicide cases and in another 25\% motivation could not be identified because of insufficient data. The proportion of unemployed among suicide committers was not significantly higher than that of employed and retired. Conclusions Severe mental disorders are a major trigger of suicidal behavior. Personal relationships should be targeted by suicide prevention interventions. Somatic illnesses are increasingly important suicide risk factor driven by the ongoing process of population aging. Frontline healthcare professionals should be trained to explore underlying suicidal motives and actively probe for depression in each case of suicidal behavior. Unemployment related suicide risk is most likely mediated through an adaptation crisis mechanism induced by the abrupt change of social status.},

	abstract = {This is a milestone paper of the Coordinating Committee on Manufacturing and Logistics Systems (CC5) of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC). Classical applications of control engineering and information and communication technology (ICT) in production and logistics are often done in a rigid, centralized and hierarchical way. These inflexible approaches are typically not able to cope with the complexities of the manufacturing environment, such as the instabilities, uncertainties and abrupt changes caused by internal and external disturbances, or a large number and variety of interacting, interdependent elements. A paradigm shift, e.g., novel organizing principles and methods, is needed for supporting the interoperability of dynamic alliances of agile and networked systems. Several solution proposals argue that the future of manufacturing and logistics lies in network-like, dynamic, open and reconfigurable systems of cooperative autonomous entities. The paper overviews various distributed approaches and technologies of control engineering and ICT that can support the realization of cooperative structures from the resource level to the level of networked enterprises. Standard results as well as recent advances from control theory, through cooperative game theory, distributed machine learning to holonic systems, cooperative enterprise modelling, system integration, and autonomous logistics processes are surveyed. A special emphasis is put on the theoretical developments and industrial applications of Robustly Feasible Model Predictive Control (RFMPC). Two case studies are also discussed: i) a holonic, PROSA-based approach to generate short-term forecasts for an additive manufacturing system by means of a delegate multi-agent system (D-MAS); and ii) an application of distributed RFMPC to a drinking water distribution system.},

	abstract = {Vibration-based analysis is an important technique in machine fault diagnosis. In complex machines, the vibration generated by a component is easily affected by the vibration of other components or is corrupted by noise from other sources. Hence, the fault-related vibration must be recovered from among those sources for accurate diagnosis. In this paper, a super-exponential algorithm (SEA) based on the single-input single-output (SISO) convolution mixing model is investigated to deconvolve the vibration signal of interest. Based on simulated vibration signals generated by a test bench in a laboratory and real signals generated by industrial machines, the characteristics of the SEA with skewness and kurtosis schemes are studied extensively for the recovery of signals with different statistical distributions. It is shown that the SEA with the skewness scheme is more suitable for the isolation of a vibration signal with an asymmetric distribution, whereas the SEA with the kurtosis scheme is more efficient for detecting a vibration with abrupt changes in its distribution. Furthermore, the effect of the equalizer length on the characteristics of the equalized signal is discussed. A performance curve that presents the equalization performance is defined, and a method that uses this curve to select the optimal equalizer length for successfully recovering the defect signal from the mixed signal is then proposed. The study presented in this paper thus shows that the SEA is a promising method for the recovery of vibrations in machine fault diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Analysis of global change effects on fire regimes requires evaluations of key processes explaining fire activity at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Classifications of the weather conditions prevailing at large continental scales (called “Synoptic Weather Types”, SWT) offer convenient potential proxies for integrating weather-related factors into our understanding of fire regime attributes at regional scales. Here we establish a methodology for identifying the major SWT that lead to wildfires and assessing their influence on fire regime in interaction with other global drivers such as drought events or fire suppression policies. Based on days with fires larger than 50 ha that occurred in Catalonia, a region located in the western Mediterranean Basin, we propose a clustering methodology using data of temperature at 850 hPa, sea level pressure and winds at 925 hPa from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset covering the whole of western Europe (25–70°N and 20°W–40°E). Our classification method proposes 6 SWT: three that were characterized by synoptic conditions leading to strong winds in the region, two that led to ‘hot and dry’ environments, and one that was not characterized by any strong weather determinants. Fires under ‘hot and dry’ conditions, such as the South intrusion SWT, triggered the bulk of fires and burnt area in the region. Spatial analyses of fire distribution under each SWT revealed markedly different fire-prone locations, opening the possibility for strategic planning of fire management based on local fire regimes. Fires occurring during mild years (wet spring conditions) and under ‘hot-and-dry’ SWTs have been eradicated from the region thanks to enhanced firefighting capability, and fire sizes in dry years have strongly reduced. In contrast, fires occurring under windy situations have not followed the same course of change and have not diminished in incidence over time, and seem to be more difficult to control using current fire suppression strategies. The role of SWT on determining fire regimes and its interaction with fire suppression strategies has a huge potential to help researchers and managers develop better fire analyses based on sound physical grounds and serve to understand and eventually regulate the adverse impacts of fire regime changes in a global change context.},

A general method for detecting excitation based on an analysis of the process input is detailed, along with the use of this data to update an adaptive controller internal model. The method, applicable to a number of adaptive strategies, is demonstrated using an adaptive PI controller with Smith predictor. Because unmeasured disturbances can occur during excitation events and corrupt the resultant model, model gains are collected as they are computed and used in an automated procedure to generate a continuous gain schedule function. This function provides information for measuring the success of future model fits, even as operating regime changes for processes with nonlinear gain characteristics, and provides an adaptation mechanism for controlling such processes. To minimize the expertise required to implement these methods, an automated startup procedure is detailed. The methods are demonstrated on two simulated reactor processes that possess nonlinear and s},

	abstract = {Introduction: Drug-induced QT interval prolongation may lead to ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of the study was to optimize QT interval data processing to quantify drug-induced QT interval prolongation in the telemetry instrumented conscious dog model. Methods: The test substances cisapride, dofetilide, haloperidol, and terfenadine and corresponding vehicles were given to male and female beagle dogs during two consecutive 90-min intravenous infusions. Cardiovascular parameters were recorded for 24 h and exposure to the drugs was measured. The delayed response in the QT interval after an abrupt change in heart rate was investigated. Eight mathematical models to describe the QT interval–heart rate relationship were compared and different sets of covariates were used to quantify the drug-induced effect on the QT interval. Results: After an abrupt decrease in heart rate, a 75\% adaptation of the QT interval was reached after 54±9 s. A linear model was preferred to correct the drug-induced effect on the QT interval for heart rate, vehicle effect, serial correlation, plasma concentration and time of day. All test substances significantly prolonged the QT interval. Discussion: To optimize the processing of QT interval data, the delay in QT interval response after an abrupt change in heart rate should be considered. The QT interval–heart rate relationship and vehicle response were individual-specific and corrections were therefore made individually. When estimating the drug-induced effect on the QT interval it is considered advantageous to use plasma concentration as a covariate, as well as adjusting for vehicle effect and serial correlation in measurements. The conscious dog model detected significant increases in the QT interval for all test substances investigated.},

The acceleration signal features of identification and extraction in the process of speed change are important for the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. The full-spectrum cascade analysis of rotating machinery vibrations is an efficient method that enables the symptoms of some special types of fault (especially for rub) to be clearly detected. Some typical compound rub malfunctions have been researched by experiments in this study. Acceleration signals have been received by the experimental apparatus and analysed by full spectrum. The abrupt changes in surging acceleration signals of rotor malfunctions can be detected and their fault feature spectra shown in full-spectrum cascade plots. The full-spectrum experimental data are applied to the support vector machine (SVM) training to be classified. The results indicate the potential and feasibility of this approach for the diagnosis of rotor malfunctions. The full-spectrum cascade plot can enhance the feature information for the knowledge base of the rotating machinery rub fault diagnosis system and is of great significance to diagnose compound rub faults in a rotor more accurately.},

	abstract = {Located in the foothills of the Indian Himalaya, Rajaji National Park was established to protect and enhance the habitat of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and tiger (Panthera tigris). In 2002 the Van Gujjars, indigenous forest pastoralists, were voluntarily resettled from the Chilla Range (an administrative unit of Rajaji National Park) to Gaindikhata, a nearby area where they were granted land for agriculture. In this study we used a variety of remote sensing approaches to identify changes in land cover associated with the resettlement. The methods comprise two main approaches. First, we used object-based image analysis (OBIA) to identify the pre-resettlement land cover classes of use areas (representing agricultural expansion and adjacent areas of grazing, and collection of fuelwood and fodder) and recovery areas (representing areas where settlements were removed, and the adjacent areas of resource use). Secondly, we used trend analysis to assess the gradual and abrupt changes in vegetation that took place in use and recovery areas. To conduct the trend analysis we used BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend), which separates seasonal variation from long-term trends, and identifies breaks that can be linked back to disturbances or land cover changes. We found that the OBIA classification yielded high average class accuracies, and we were able to make class distinctions that would have been difficult to make using a traditional pixel-based approach. Pre-resettlement, the recovery areas were classified as mixed forest and riparian vegetation. In contrast, the use areas were classified primarily as grass dominated, brush dominated, and plantation forest, and were located relatively far away from riparian areas. Following the resettlement, the trend analysis showed a sudden change in the seasonal variation of NDVI in areas converted to agriculture. Areas neighboring the new agricultural land experienced sudden decreases in NDVI, suggestive of disturbances, at a higher rate than the same land cover types elsewhere. At the same time, these neighboring areas experienced a gradual overall increase in NDVI which could be caused by an expansion of leafy invasive shrubs such as Lantana camara in areas heavily used for biomass collection. The recovery areas also experienced a gradual increase in NDVI as well as sudden breaks to this trend, but we lacked evidence to connect these changes to the resettlement. Our findings support the claim that the resettlement has shifted pressure from more ecologically valuable to less ecologically valuable land cover types, and suggest that to some degree resource use pressure has increased outside the park. The study employs a novel synthesis of OBIA and trend analysis that could be applied to land change studies more broadly.},

Methods The authors propose several simple measures to discriminate between stable–unstable, increasing–decreasing, linear–nonlinear, monotonic–nonmonotonic patterns of change. They then suggest using factor analysis to select the subset of nonredundant measures, and cluster analysis, based on the selected measures, to identify subgroups of patients with similar longitudinal trajectories. The proposed approach is illustrated using data on osteoarthritis disability from a longitudinal study undertaken in Toronto, Ontario, in 1996–2001. Disability was measured at four points in time for 835 patients, using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index. Results The proposed measures allowed the detection of individual patients with specific patterns of change and identification of four different groups of patients with WOMAC scores that are (1) regularly increasing, (2) regularly decreasing, (3) stable over time, or (4) highly unstable, with abrupt changes or short-term fluctuations. Conclusion The proposed approach may be used to (1) screen even large databases to identify particular patterns of change; or (2) summarize different patterns of change by classifying patients into groups with similar trajectories. Once identified, the groups can be investigated to determine whether there are differences in patient characteristics or outcomes.},

	abstract = {Torrefaction is a mild pyrolysis treatment under inert atmosphere that has been found to improve the physical and chemical properties of biomass as a fuel. In this study, several wood fuels: willow, eucalyptus, a mixture of hardwoods (oak and birch) and a mixture of softwoods (pine, larch and spruce) were torrefied at 270 and 290°C with two residence times (30 and 60min). Physicochemical properties of the torrefied materials, such as grindability, density, hydrophobicity and surface area were investigated. Furthermore, information was also obtained from microscopic and spectrometric studies, namely transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), to gain an insight into any changes in morphology and chemical composition due to the treatments. Temperature plays a major role during torrefaction and choosing an optimum condition is fundamental to attaining a satisfactory energy yield. Results show the lower temperature and shorter residence time was the best treatment to achieve good physical properties with a relatively high energy yield. When treated at these conditions, the softwood mixture had the highest energy (95\%), followed by the hardwood mixture (80\%), then willow (79\%), and finally eucalyptus (75\%). Increasing the severity of the torrefaction conditions greatly improved the physical characteristics of the torrefied biomass, in terms of grindability properties and hydrophobicity. While little difference in porosity and surface area were detected by the methods used, the XPS and FTIR studies showed that torrefaction results in a decrease in the ROH groups and an increase in CO groups within the fuels. This results in a decrease in the affinity of the fuels to absorb water, and therefore improves their hydrophobicity. For all the fuels, there was a critical temperature for torrefaction, above which abrupt changes in many properties occurred. These include hydrophobicity, energy yield, and grindability. The critical temperatures were fuel dependent and therefore the results indicate that careful optimisation is required for all fuel types to maximise the benefits of torrefaction whilst maintaining a good energy yield.},

The basic idea of the method is that the structural damages can be identified as the abrupt changes in energy distribution of structural responses at high frequencies. Using the time-varying VARMA model to represent the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) obtained from the EMD of vibration signal, we define a damage index according to the VARMA coefficients. In the two examples given, the Imperial County Services Building and the Van Nuys hotel are used as the benchmark structures to verify the effectiveness and sensitivity of the damage index in real environments with the presence of actual noise. The analysis results show that the damage index can indicate the occurrence and relative severity of structural damages at multiple locations in an efficient manner. The damage index can also be potentially used for structural health monitoring, since it is based on the time-varying VARMA coefficients.

Method A descriptive study with a qualitative data analysis was conducted. In-depth individual interviews were carried out with 18 married biological parents of children with cancer. Data was analyzed using an inductive content analysis. Results The following themes represented the couples’ experiences: (1) Abrupt changes after the child's diagnosis resulting in marital strain and need to focus on the present; (2) United but distant; (3) Exchanging roles; (4) Being parents all the time; (5) Focusing on the positive side of the experience; (6) Rescuing the marital relationship. The marital relationship of parents with a child/adolescent who has cancer may undergo either positive or negative changes, with intimacy and sexuality being negatively affected by the disease. Although the relationship may be more fragile after the illness, increased mutual commitment was observed in some couples. Conclusions Results indicate that health professionals should include parents as an important focus of their care. The establishment of solid bonds to enhance couples’ communication is recommended as a way to provide anticipatory guidance to address the identified changes in marital relationships. The opportunities for dialog and partnership help couples to target their needs and recognize their strengths in order to mitigate the impact of a child's illness.},

We focus our attention on the simple case of a mean value jump of a stationary random process, as it includes various other cases. The aim of the present study is to compare the performances of two classes of detectors, the first based on conventional segmentation algorithms and the second on the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). The first section gives a brief overview of the methods, and highlights the 2-D wavelet detectors such as the sum of fixed scales slices or the 2-D correlation with the CWT jump signature. According to previous results [4,6], the optimal wavelet maximizes the signal to noise ratio in the (time, scale) plane. Unlike the usual representations, these detectors take advantage of information redundancy in the plane. The second section is devoted to the comparison between the different methods, by means of the detectors characteristics in terms of probability of false alarm and non-detection. A common criterion of detection delay is taken into account, as well as the accuracy of the detection date, or the possibility of detecting two close jumps. Finally, we give some indications relating to the performance of non-abrupt changes with the new optimal wavelet, and evaluate the possibility of those methods to deal with other jumps.},

Here we present a fully nonlinear inverse method to extract the rock uplift history of the central Andean Plateau from the Cotahuasi River and its tributaries. Our approach is based on an analytical solution to the stream power model that relates elevation to rock uplift history under the assumptions of constant climatic conditions in space and time and spatially invariant rock uplift. We use a Bayesian framework that allows us to quantify the full state of knowledge of model parameters (i.e., uncertainties, trade-offs). The erosional efficiency defines the landscape response time, and this must be determined using independent data. Therefore, using thermochronometric data from the Cotahuasi–Ocoña Canyon, which record rapid fluvial incision at 13–10Ma, we calibrate our results to infer a rock uplift history for the north-central Andean Plateau. We infer a pulse of rock uplift between 25 and 10Ma at rates as high as 0.25km/My. However, the rock uplift rate inferred during this pulse is not as high as is predicted if the central Andean Plateau grew as a result of loss of unstable lithospheric mantle. Therefore, our results are more consistent with models requiring gradual uplift of the central Andean Plateau.},

The “protected isthmus” of the reentrant circuit is critical for the maintenance of VTs and the target for catheter ablation. Various techniques based on conventional electrophysiology and/or detailed three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the VT circuit are used to unmask this isthmus. Objective The purpose of this study was to assess pace-maps (PMs) to identify postinfarct VT isthmuses. We hypothesized that an abrupt change in paced QRS morphology may be used to identify a VT isthmus and be targeted for successful ablation. Methods High-density 3D PMs were matched to the subsequent 3D endocardial reentrant VT activation mapping in 10 patients (8 men; age 70.7 ± 10.8 years) who underwent successful postinfarct VT ablation. At each pacing site in a given patient, the 12-lead ECG recorded during pacing was compared to that of VT, with the resulting matching percentage (up to 100\% for perfect matches) allocated to this point to generate color-coded PMs. Results With respect to VT isthmuses, the best percentages of matching were found in the exit zones and isthmus exit part (89\% ± 8\% and 84\% ± 7\%, respectively) and the poorest adjacent to scar border in the outer entrance zones (23\% ± 28\%), in the entrance zones (39\% ± 34\%), and in the entrance part of the isthmus (32\% ± 26\%). The color-coded sequence (from the best to the poorest matching sites) on the PMs revealed figure-of-eight pictures matching the VT activation time maps and identifying VT isthmuses.

It is found that the inner boundary can be modeled as a total reflective surface for the infinitely long hollow cylinder. Radiative absorption of hollow cylinders with Fresnel surfaces is compared to diffusive surfaces predicted by the finite volume method. Effects of refractive index, optical thickness and hole size on radiative absorption are studied. Abrupt changes in radiative absorption near τr/τRo=1/n are observed for hollow cylinders with Fresnel surfaces. It is because the Fresnel relation predicts a critical angle at sin-1θcr=1/n. This trend is not observed in diffusive surfaces. Refractive index and optical thickness are two competing factors that govern the radiative absorption. Higher refractive index drives higher absorption close to the inner surface, while higher optical thickness yields higher absorption near the outer surface. The results of this study can also serve as benchmark solutions for modeling radiative heat transfer in hollow cylinders with Fresnel surfaces. It is also found that the directional or hemispherical emittance can be calculated without solving the radiative transfer equation in the media when the temperature variation in the media is small.},

A fundamental difficulty with the robust FDI design approaches available in the literature is that they require some a priori knowledge of the model for unmeasured disturbances or modeling uncertainty. In this work, we propose a novel approach for modeling abrupt changes in unmeasured disturbances when innovation form of state space model (i.e. black box observer) is used for fault diagnosis. A disturbance coupling matrix is developed using singular value decomposition of the extended observability matrix and further used to formulate a robust fault diagnosis scheme based on generalized likelihood ratio test. The proposed modeling approach does not require any a priori knowledge of how these faults affect the system dynamics. To isolate sensor and actuator biases from step jumps in unmeasured disturbances, a statistically rigorous method is developed for distinguishing between faults modeled using different number of parameters. Simulation studies on a heavy oil fractionator example show that the proposed FDI methodology based on identified models can be used to effectively distinguish between sensor biases, actuator biases and other soft faults caused by changes in unmeasured disturbance variables. The fault tolerant control scheme, which makes use of the proposed robust FDI methodology, gives significantly better control performance than conventional controllers when soft faults occur. The experimental evaluation of the proposed FDI methodology on a laboratory scale stirred tank temperature control set-up corroborates these conclusions.},

	abstract = {Detecting a visual change was suggested to relate closely to the visual sensory memory formed by visual stimuli before the occurrence of the change, because change detection involves identifying a difference between ongoing and preceding sensory conditions. Previous neuroimaging studies showed that an abrupt visual change activates the middle occipital gyrus (MOG). However, it still remains to be elucidated whether the MOG is related to visual change detection based on sensory memory. Here we tried to settle this issue using a new method of stimulation with blue and red LEDs to emphasize a memory-based change detection process. There were two stimuli, a standard trial stimulus and a deviant trial stimulus. The former was a red light lasting 500ms, and the latter was a red light lasting 250ms immediately followed by a blue light lasting 250ms. Effects of the trial–trial interval, 250∼2000ms, were investigated to know how cortical responses to the abrupt change (from red to blue) were affected by preceding conditions. The brain response to the deviant trial stimulus was recorded by magnetoencephalography. Results of a multi-dipole analysis showed that the activity in the MOG, peaking at around 150ms after the change onset, decreased in amplitude as the interval increased, but the earlier activity in BA 17/18 was not affected by the interval. These results suggested that the MOG is an important cortical area relating to the sensory memory-based visual change-detecting system.},

	abstract = {A new approach for the estimation of apparent thermal diffusivity of foods at different drying temperatures was explored, analysed and discussed in this work. Temperature versus time was obtained numerically at the center of the food (banana, “nanicão” variety) using the 1D Fourier equation with drying temperatures in the range between approximately 17–65°C and moisture content in the range between 0.01 and 3.43 (dry basis). The solution of the partial differential equation is made with a finite difference method coupled to an optimization technique of Differential Evolution used in inverse method. The mathematical model proposed considered the effects of shrinkage and convective heat transfer at surface of fruit. Parameters of two functions, the first dependent of the moisture content and the second dependent also of the temperature were obtained by inverse method modelling the apparent thermal diffusivity. Such parameters that provide the best least square fit between the experimental and predicted time-temperatures curves are presented in this work. This study demonstrated that a small change in the temperature and moisture content of banana cause an abrupt change in the apparent thermal diffusivity, which decrease with the decreasing of the moisture. Statistical analysis shows the excellent agreement between reported and estimated curves.},

	abstract = {Internet traffic is highly dynamic and difficult to predict in current network scenarios, which enormously complicates network management and resources optimization. To address this uncertainty in a robust and efficient way, two almost antagonist Traffic Engineering (TE) techniques have been proposed in the last years: Robust Routing and Dynamic Load Balancing. Robust Routing (RR) copes with traffic uncertainty in an off-line preemptive fashion, computing a single static routing configuration that is optimized for traffic variations within some predefined uncertainty set. On the other hand, Dynamic Load Balancing (DLB) balances traffic among multiple paths in an on-line reactive fashion, adapting to traffic variations in order to optimize a certain congestion function. In this article we present the first comparative study between these two alternative methods. We are particularly interested in the performance loss of RR with respect to DLB, and on the response of DLB when faced with abrupt changes. This study brings insight into several RR and DLB algorithms, evaluating their virtues and shortcomings, which allows us to introduce new mechanisms that improve previous proposals.},

	abstract = {Objective Injury during routine spinal cord procedures could result in devastating consequences for the surgical patient. Spinal cord monitoring through somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) remains a viable method for prevention of serious injury. Methods The adaptive coherence estimation (ACE) is a method to iteratively calculate signal match quality through successive filter entrainment. Here we compare the speed of detection with ACE to conventional amplitude measurements. Both absolute magnitude of ACE and amplitude as well as slope change detector algorithm (Farley–Hinich) was run as well to determine the earliest time when a significant change occurred. Results The standard error for the ACE algorithm is close to one tenth of the amplitude measure, Since the ACE algorithm achieved low variance during baseline measurement, we were able to achieve rapid detection of injury. For absolute magnitude detection ACE was faster than amplitude for the 20g injury weight class. It took an average of 10 epochs to detect the injury with adaptive coherence and nearly 19 with standard amplitude metrics using absolute magnitude changes. Abrupt change detection methods using slope change show that ACE provides more favorable detection capabilities comparable to amplitude. Additionally, there was a significant increase in the ROC curve between ACE and amplitude alone (p{\textless}0.05). Conclusions Because of its excellent detection capabilities, the adaptive coherence method provides an excellent supplement to traditional amplitude for capturing injury-related changes in SEPs. Significance Adaptive coherence remains a viable method for rapidly and accurately detecting spinal injury.},

For case study, single logging curve and multiscale fusion curve in well A in Shengtuo Oilfield are processed by quadric spline wavelet and thereby sequence boundaries on different scales can be detected. The result shows: by demarcating sequence stratigraphic units with the multiscale fusion curve analysis, better effect could be obtained.

NMR relaxometry and diffusometry have been used to independently study the size and connectivity of adsorbed liquid ganglia at different molten fractions. It has been found that the onset of significant advanced melting coincided with abrupt changes in levels of individual pore-filling and ganglia inter-connections determined by NMR. These findings also highlighted where significant advanced adsorption processes were occurring, where larger pores were being filled with condensate before smaller pores.

	abstract = {The aging heart undergoes well characterized structural changes associated with functional decline, though the underlying mechanisms are not understood. The aim of this study was to determine to what extent ventricular myocardial protein expression was altered with age and which proteins underwent protein nitration. Fischer 344×Brown Norway F1 hybrid (FBN) rats of four age groups were used, 4, 12, 24, and 34 months. Differential protein expression was determined by 2-DE and proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. Altered protein nitration with age was assessed by immunoblotting. Over 1000 protein spots per sample were detected, and 255 were found to be differentially expressed when all aged groups were compared to young rats (4 months) (p⩽0.05). A strong positive correlation between differential protein expression and increasing age (p=0.03, R2=0.997) indicated a progressive, rather than abrupt, change with age. Of 46 differentially expressed proteins identified, seventeen have roles in apoptosis, ten in hypertrophy, seven in fibrosis, and three in diastolic dysfunction, aging-associated processes previously reported in both human and FBN rat heart. Protein expression alterations detected here could have beneficial effects on cardiac function; thus, our data indicate a largely adaptive change in protein expression during aging. In contrast, differential protein nitration increased abruptly, rather than progressively, at 24 months of age. Altogether, the results suggest that differential myocardial protein expression occurs in a progressive manner during aging, and that a proteomic-based approach is an effective method for the identification of potential therapeutic targets to mitigate aging-related myocardial dysfunction.},

	abstract = {Purpose To identify the characteristics that are associated significantly with visual field (VF) defects in highly myopic eyes. Design Retrospective, observational series. Methods The medical records of 492 eyes of 308 patients with high myopia (myopic refractive error {\textgreater} 8 diopters or axial length ≥ 26.5 mm) with a follow-up of 5 years or more were reviewed. The VFs were determined by Goldmann kinetic perimetry, and the VFs were quantified in 100 sectors within the V4 isopter. Eyes with loss of 10\% or more of the sectors were classified as having significant VF defects, and a further loss of 10\% or more during the follow-up period was classified as a significant progression. To avoid the influence of the posterior fundus changes resulting from the high myopia, eyes with any type of myopic macular or peripheral lesions that could cause visual field defects were excluded. Results Significant VF defects were newly developed in 13.2\% of these selected highly myopic eyes during a mean follow-up ± standard deviation of 11.6 ± 5.5 years. The incidence of significant VF defects in myopic eyes was significantly higher in eyes with an oval optic disc than that in eyes with a round optic disc. An oval optic disc was present significantly more frequently in the myopic eyes with VF defects. Temporal and nasal VF defects were present in the same eye. Among the eyes with significant VF defect, the temporal VF defects were observed in 61.5\% of the eyes with round discs, in 75.0\% of the eyes with vertically oval discs, and in 68.2\% of the eyes with obliquely oval discs. During a mean follow-up ± standard deviation of 10.2 ± 3.4 years, 73.8\% of the eyes showed a significant progression of the VF defects. An abrupt change of the scleral curvature (types VII and IX staphyloma by Curtin) was the only factor significantly associated with a progression of the VF defects. Conclusions Because the VF defects are progressive, we suggest that high myopia is a high risk factor for VF defects and that these eyes be examined at least once yearly. The combination of stretching and distortion of the optic nerve fibers resulting from an abrupt change of scleral curvature may be the factors that lead to the damage of the optic nerve fibers in highly myopic eyes.},

Therefore, this work aims to study spatio-temporal variation of the sediment discharge and erosion rate in the Mahanadi river, one of the biggest rivers in India, over past three decades vis-à-vis their controlling factors. To understand the sediment load variation, the trend analysis in the time series data of rainfall, water and sediment discharge of the Mahanadi river were also attempted. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Sen's methods were used to determine whether there was a positive or negative trend in the time series data with their statistical significance. The occurrence of abrupt changes was detected using Pettitt test. The trend test result represents that sediment load delivered from the Mahanadi river to the global ocean has decreased sharply at the rate of 0.515×106tons/year between 1980 and 2010. Water discharge and rainfall in the basin showed no significant decreasing trend except at only one tributary. The decline in sediment discharge from the basin to the Bay of Bengal is mainly due to the increase in the number of dams, which has recorded the increase from 70 to 253 during the period of 1980 to 2010. Over the past 30years the Mahanadi river has discharged about 49.0±20.5km3 of water and 17.4±12.7×106tons of sediment annually to the Bay of Bengal whereas the mean erosional rate is 265±125tons/km2/year over the period of 30years in the basin. Based on the current data (2000–2001 to 2009–2010), sediment flux and water discharge to the ocean are 12±5×106tons/year and 49±16km3/year respectively; and ranking Mahanadi river second in terms of water discharge and sediment flux to the ocean among the peninsular rivers in India.},

Both airborne radar and space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery (Ku-, X-, C-, and L-band) have been used previously to determine whether lakes have a BI or FI regime in a given year, across a number of years, or across large regions. In this study, we use a combination of ERS-1/2, RADARSAT-2, Envisat, and Sentinel-1 SAR imagery for seven lake-rich regions in Arctic Alaska to analyze lake ice regime extents and dynamics over a 25-year period (1992–2016). Our interactive threshold classification method determines a unique statistic-based intensity threshold for each SAR scene, allowing for the comparison of classification results from C-band SAR data acquired with different polarizations and incidence angles. Additionally, our novel method accommodates declining signal strength in aging extended-mission satellite SAR instruments. Comparison of SAR ice regime classifications with extensive field measurements from six years yielded a 93\% accuracy. Significant declines in BI regimes were only observed in the Fish Creek area with 3\% of lakes exhibiting transitional ice regimes—lakes that switch from BI to FI during this 25-year period. This analysis suggests that the potential conversion from BI to FI regimes is primarily a function of lake depth distributions in addition to regional differences in climate variability. Remote sensing of lake ice regimes with C-band SAR is a useful tool to monitor the associated thermal impacts on permafrost, since lake ice regimes can be used as a proxy for of sub-lake permafrost thaw, considered by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Continued winter warming and variable snow conditions in the Arctic are expected and our long-term analysis provides a valuable baseline for predicting where potential future lake ice regimes shifts will be most pronounced.},

	abstract = {Objectives The solubility isotherm (S) of hydroxyapatite (HAp) is of fundamental importance to saliva chemistry, dental caries and related contexts. It has previously been shown that the locus of the S[HAp] is substantially lower than is commonly reported, and of different slope, probably due to HAps incongruent dissolution. The aim of the present study was to determine the S[HAp] over a wider pH range and to identify the precipitate formed at equilibrium in HAp solid titration. Methods The solid titration technique of Leung and Darvell (Leung VW-H, Darvell BW. Calcium-phosphate system in saliva-like media. J Chem Soc Faraday Trans 1991;87(11):1759–64.) was used to investigate the solubility behaviour of HAp at 37.0±0.1°C in 100mM aqueous KCl. The pH range studied overlapped that of earlier work from pH 3.6 to 5.2, for a reproducibility check and validation, and extended to pH ∼2.9. XRD and EDX were used to identify the precipitates. SEM and TEM were used to observe the morphology. Results The previous S[HAp] reported by Chen et al. (Chen Z-F, Darvell BW, Leung VW-H. Hydroxyapatite solubility in simple inorganic solutions. Arch Oral Biol 2004;49(5):359–67.) was reconfirmed. An abrupt change of slope of S[HAp] was detected at pH ∼3.9. No other phase than HAp was found at pH 3.2, 3.6 and 4.1. In particular, brushite (dicalcium phosphate dihydrate) was not detected, even below pH 3.9, where instead calcium-deficient HAp was formed. Conclusion The solid titration method was reconfirmed as reproducible and to yield HAp from pH 2.9 to 5.2. The expected brushite did not appear, but rather a stable calcium-deficient HAp was consistently formed. The chemistry of calcium phosphates needs to be reevaluated.},

	abstract = {The natural flow regime of rivers has been strongly altered world-wide, resulting in ecosystem degradation and lakes drying up, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Determining whether this is due mainly to climate change or to water withdrawal for direct human use (e.g. irrigation) is difficult, particularly for saline lake basins where hydrology data are scarce. In this study, we developed an approach for assessing climate and land use change impacts based on river flow records for headwater and lowland reaches of rivers, using the case of Lake Urmia basin, in north-westen Iran. Flow regimes at upstream and downstream stations were studied before and after major dam construction and irrigation projects. Data from 57 stations were used to establish five different time intervals representing 10 different land use development periods (scenarios) for upstream (not impacted) and downstream (impacted) systems. An existing river impact (RI) index was used to assess changes in three main characteristics of flow (magnitude, timing and, intra-annual variability). The results showed that irrigation was by far the main driving force for river flow regime changes in the lake basin. All stations close to the lake and on adjacent plains showed significantly higher impacts of land use change than headwaters. As headwaters are relatively unaffected by agriculture, the non-significant changes observed in headwater flow regimes indicate a minor effect of climate change on river flows in the region. The benefit of the method developed is clear interpretation of results based on river flow records, which is useful in communicating land use and climate change information to decision makers and lake restoration planners.},

	abstract = {A high-resolution (HR) numerical model for solving 1D shallow water equations employing Voellmy flow resistance relation is developed to predict the time-dependent behavior of non-Newtonian debris flow dynamics in non-erodible channel. The governing equations are solved by the HR shock-capturing method employing the HLLC approximate Riemann solver and the TVD limiter. Based on the fractional-step approach, source terms are treated by an implicit method which makes the model well balanced even when the friction force dominates the flow. A CFL criterion accounting for the total friction velocity is employed to ensure numerically stable solutions. The comparison of numerical results with analytical solutions and experimental measurements shows that the present HR numerical modeling yields accurate solution near discontinuities beyond the first-order-accurate Godunov-type method that is widely used for modeling debris flows. The evaluation tests reveal that the present method yields numerically stable and efficient solutions of debris flows moving downslope with significant basal friction. The application to two debris flows that were experimentally generated with a fixed-volume and a continuous source reveals that the numerical model reproduces the propagation speed of debris flow on the slopes and the deposition pattern on the fan with reasonable accuracy. Overall results indicate that the present model can provide useful information on transient features of debris flow behavior through the channel with an abrupt change in bottom slope.},

Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the jump or breakpoint of the volatility phenomenon, and their findings have been applied in modeling volatility. However, few studies address the issue from a practical point of view. Specifically, a financial crisis accompanied by markedly increased volatility can be approached from this perspective to suggest the persistence or termination of a crisis. This paper develops the ICSS-CRISIS algorithm, a new approach to identify a crisis period along with the conditions for the ICSS algorithm which represents the structural breakpoints of volatility. This algorithm recommends a guideline to determine whether an existing crisis in the market resulted from financial volatility, was terminated, or is continuing. The method is tested along with the ICSS algorithm to prove the effectiveness of Credit Default Swap index data.},

Since the traffic data collected in real time reflects the past or current conditions on the roadway, a predictive travel time methodology should be used to obtain the information to be disseminated. However, an important part of the literature either uses instantaneous travel time assumption, and sums the travel time of roadway segments at the starting time of the trip, or uses statistical forecasting algorithms to predict the future travel time. This study benefits from the available traffic flow fundamentals (e.g. shockwave analysis and bottleneck identification), and makes use of both historical and real time traffic information to provide travel time prediction. The methodological framework of this approach sequentially includes a bottleneck identification algorithm, clustering of traffic data in traffic regimes with similar characteristics, development of stochastic congestion maps for clustered data and an online congestion search algorithm, which combines historical data analysis and real-time data to predict experienced travel times at the starting time of the trip. The experimental results based on the loop detector data on Californian freeways indicate that the proposed method provides promising travel time predictions under varying traffic conditions.},

	abstract = {Summary Objective Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is part of a spectrum of cerebral white matter injury which is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants. While PVL is common in neonates with cardiac disease, both before and after surgery, it is less common in older infants with cardiac disease. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative risk factors for the occurrence of PVL are poorly understood. The main objective of the present work is to identify potential hemodynamic risk factors for PVL occurrence in neonates with complex heart disease using logistic regression analysis and decision tree algorithms. Methods The postoperative hemodynamic and arterial blood gas data (monitoring variables) collected in the cardiac intensive care unit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia were used for predicting the occurrence of PVL. Three categories of datasets for 103 infants and neonates were used—(1) original data without any preprocessing, (2) partial data keeping the admission, the maximum and the minimum values of the monitoring variables, and (3) extracted dataset of statistical features. The datasets were used as inputs for forward stepwise logistic regression to select the most significant variables as predictors. The selected features were then used as inputs to the decision tree induction algorithm for generating easily interpretable rules for prediction of PVL. Results Three sets of data were analyzed in SPSS for identifying statistically significant predictors (p{\textless}0.05) of PVL through stepwise logistic regression and their correlations. The classification success of the Case 3 dataset of extracted statistical features was best with sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP) and accuracy (AC) of 87, 88 and 87\%, respectively. The identified features, when used with decision tree algorithms, gave SN, SP and AC of 90, 97 and 94\% in training and 73, 58 and 65\% in test. The identified variables in Case 3 dataset mainly included blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, partial pressures pO2 and pCO2, and their statistical features like average, variance, skewness (a measure of asymmetry) and kurtosis (a measure of abrupt changes). Rules for prediction of PVL were generated automatically through the decision tree algorithms. Conclusions The proposed approach combines the advantages of statistical approach (regression analysis) and data mining techniques (decision tree) for generation of easily interpretable rules for PVL prediction. The present work extends an earlier research [Galli KK, Zimmerman RA, Jarvik GP, Wernovsky G, Kuijpers M, Clancy RR, et al. Periventricular leukomalacia is common after cardiac surgery. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2004;127:692–704] in the form of expanding the feature set, identifying additional prognostic factors (namely pCO2) emphasizing the temporal variations in addition to upper or lower values, and generating decision rules.

The analysis shows that the most powerful cycles of the spectra can be interpreted in terms of periods (and their respective higher harmonics) of astronomical origin. An intense stationary sinusoid from the spectrum with period T∼6500 yr, the 4th harmonic of the period of equinox precession, correlates with the time variations of the geomagnetic dipole moment. The most powerful non-stationary sinusoid with mean period T=2230 yr, reflects oscillations in C14 data related to the non-dipole part of the geomagnetic field, and correlates with periods of climate warming/cooling. The apparent regularities that can be inferred in the interaction of such two powerful cycles (i.e. stationary and non-stationary parts of the uniform mechanism of the geomagnetic field generation) permit to forecast a tendency of the climate changes. A possible physical mechanism is presented based on a possible transformation, of some signals caused by perturbation of the tidal forces of astronomical origin (that can arise along the orbit of the Earth), into effects that control geophysical systems through small variations of the dissipative parameters of a dynamo system.},

	abstract = {Background Dread Pirate Roberts, founder of the first cryptomarket for illicit drugs named Silk Road, articulated libertarian political motives for his ventures. Previous research argues that there is a significant political component present or involved in cryptomarket drug dealing which is specifically libertarian. The aim of the paper is to investigate the prevalence of political discourses within discussions of cryptomarket drug dealing, and further to research the potential changes of these over the timespan of the study. Methods We develop a novel operationalization of discourse analytic concepts which we combine with topic modelling enabling us to study how politics are articulated on cryptomarket forums. We apply the Structural Topic Model on a corpus extracted from crawls of cryptomarket forums encompassing posts dating from 2011 to 2015. Results The topics discussed on cryptomarket forums are primarily centered around the distribution of drugs including discussions of shipping and receiving, product advertisements, and reviews as well as aspects of drug consumption such as testing and consumption. However, on forums whose primary function is aiding operations on a black market, we still observe political matter. We identified one topic which expresses a libertarian discourse that emphasizes the individual's right to non-interference. Over time we observe an increasing prevalence of the libertarian discourse from 2011 to the end of 2013. In the end of 2013 – when Silk Road was seized – we observe an abrupt change in the prevalence of the libertarian discourse. Conclusions The libertarian political discourse has historically been prevalent on cryptomarket forums. The closure of Silk Road has affected the prevalence of libertarian discourse suggesting that while the closure did not succeed in curtailing the cryptomarket economy, it dampened political sentiments.},

However, in 2006 the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) adopted the new monetary policy framework through which short-term interest rates are adjusted to achieve stability in the value of the domestic currency. This paper has presented an empirical investigation into the demand for Nigerian real narrow money (M1) over the period 1960–2008 in an attempt to identify whether the CBN were right to adopt the new monetary policy framework. In doing so, we estimate alternative (canonical and extended) specifications of M1 demand using structural change methods. Our results suggest that the canonical specification is well-determined. Although the money demand relationship went through a regime shift in 1986, it is largely stable. These findings favour the use of supply of money as an instrument of monetary policy, thus lending limited support for the new monetary policy framework.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel and robust modus operandi for fast and accurate shot boundary detection where the whole design philosophy is based on human perceptual rules and the well-known “Information Seeking Mantra”. By adopting a top–down approach, redundant video processing is avoided and furthermore elegant shot boundary detection accuracy is obtained under significantly low computational costs. Objects within shots are detected via local image features and used for revealing visual discontinuities among shots. The proposed method can be used for detecting all types of gradual transitions as well as abrupt changes. Another important feature is that the proposed method is fully generic, which can be applied to any video content without requiring any training or tuning in advance. Furthermore, it allows a user interaction to direct the SBD process to the user's “Region of Interest” or to stop it once satisfactory results are obtained. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior computational times compared to the state-of-art methods without sacrificing performance.},

	abstract = {Since their discovery, the abrupt climate changes that punctuated the last glacial period (∼110.6–14.62 ka) have attracted considerable attention. Originating in the North-Atlantic area, these abrupt changes have been recorded in ice, marine and terrestrial records all over the world, but especially in the Northern Hemisphere, with various environmental implications. Ice-core records of unprecedented temporal resolution from northern Greenland allow to specify the timing of these abrupt changes, which are associated with sudden temperature increases in Greenland over a few decades, very precisely. The continental records have, so far, been mainly interpreted in terms of temperature, precipitation or vegetation changes between the relatively warm “Greenland Interstadials” (GI) and the cooler “Greenland Stadials” (GS). Here we compare records from Greenland ice and northwestern European eolian deposits in order to establish a link between GI and the soil development in European mid-latitudes, as recorded in loess sequences. For the different types of observed paleosols, we use the correlation with the Greenland records to propose estimates of the maximum time lapses needed to achieve the different degrees of maturation and development. To identify these time lapses more precisely, we compare two independent ice-core records: δ18O and dust concentration, indicating variations of atmospheric temperature and dustiness in the Greenland area, respectively. Our method slightly differs from the definition of a GI event duration applied in other studies, where the sharp end of the δ18O decrease alone defines the end of a GI. We apply the same methodology to both records (i.e., the GIs are defined to last from the beginning of the abrupt δ18O increase or dust concentration decrease until the time when δ18O or dust recur to their initial value before the GI onset), determined both visually and algorithmically, and compare them to published estimates of GI timing and duration. The duration of the GI and consequently the maximum time for paleosol development varies between 200 and 4200 years when visually determined and between 200 and 4800 years when estimated algorithmically for GI 17 to 2, i.e. an interval running from 60 ka to 23 ka b2k (age before 2000 AD). Furthermore, we investigate the abruptness of the transition from stadial to interstadial conditions, which initiates the paleosol development. The average transition duration is 55.4 ± 16.1 (56.8 ± 19.6) years when determined visually, and 36.4 ± 13.4 (60.00 ± 21.2) years when determined algorithmically for the δ18O (dust concentration). The δ18O increases correspond to a mean temperature difference of 11.8 °C on the top of the Greenland ice sheet, associated with substantial reorganizations of the ecosystems in mid-latitude Europe.},

The standard technique consists on monitoring various bio-physiological signals of the patient during sleep. The resulting recording, the polysomnography (PSG) is then analyzed offline by the physician. This supposes a very time-consuming task and therefore automation of these analyses is desirable. An arousal during sleep is defined as an abrupt shift in EEG frequency. Normal structure of sleep is altered by the presence of these events, thus being an important factor that influences on the quality of sleep. The use of computing assistance for the detection of these events on the PSG is aimed at reducing the cost of the PSG test, both in economical and human resources. In this work, a dataset containing PSGs of real patients was used for the detection of arousals in sleep. A total of 42 features were extracted from biosignals for the detection of these events. Our aim was to use different feature selection methods to eliminate the redundant features studying their influence on the identification of sleep arousals, checking whether classification could be improved. The objective is to reduce the number of features, identifying the subset of those with more relevance while preserving a good performance on the classifier. Two approximations are explored, wrappers and filters, using different methods of both, and also combinations of each of the methods by means of the union and the intersection of the relevant features obtained. The results showed that discarding the irrelevant features by these methods is feasible, reducing the dimensionality on the input space and also improving the accuracy of the classifiers.},

	abstract = {The percent carrying capacity Kp is the equilibrium population in percentage terms of a species that an area can support while adequately meeting the needs of every individual. It is readily determined from a time series of percentage abundances for a species, in which pit is the percentage abundance of the ith species at time t. The percentage point change in abundance of a species Δpi between two samples is given by Δpi=pit+1−pit, where pit+1 is the percentage abundance at a subsequent time t+1. The rate of population change in percentage points for each percent at a given time or point t, here termed rt, is given by rt=Δpi/pit. Linear regression of rt against pit gives rt=rm–s·pit, in which the constant rm is the rate of increase in rt where pit approaches zero, and the negative slope s represents the combined strength of intraspecific, interspecific and abiotic interactions for the species investigated. Setting rt=0, so that pit=Kp and rm–s·Kp=0, gives Kp=rm/s. The Upper Quaternary of ODP 1006A contains two subsections with rich bathyal benthic foraminiferal assemblages separated by samples yielding few specimens. Values of rm, s and Kp were calculated for five species (Globocassidulina subglobosa, Planulina ariminensis, Cibicidoides pachyderma, Cassidulina laevigata, Uvigerina laevis) within these subsections and 95\% confidence intervals were computed for rm and s. The rate of change of the percentage abundance for each percent rt, as indicated by the slope s, differs between species (P. ariminensis and C. pachyderma vs. C. laevigata) and can also vary within a single species over time (G. subglobosa). Likewise, values of rm differ between species (P. ariminensis vs. C. pachyderma) and can also change within a single species over time (G. subglobosa). Points of change from one value of Kp to another in a stratigraphic section mark regime shifts and have potential for ecostratigraphic correlation. Within the Upper Quaternary of ODP Hole 1006A they apparently reflect an increase in the organic matter flux in the uppermost part of the section. The method described here can be applied to any species in any taxon for which percentage data are available. For those in the hydrocarbon industry it should prove especially useful for detailed studies of intervals of economic interest.},

	abstract = {Studies have shown that, city size and rank follow a Pareto distribution across countries and over time. However, inconsistent definitions and measurements of city size (e.g., urban population and urban area) in census data in China have hindered the retrieval of comparable Pareto coefficients over time. Additionally, abrupt changes in size and rank at the city level are neglected in many studies. In this study, we extracted an alternative and consistently comparable measurement of city size from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Line-scan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light images. Besides the traditional regression analysis at the national level, we also adopted the rank clock method to analyze city-size evolution at the city level. We found that: (1) the distribution of urban areas became more even in China, with an increase of the Pareto's coefficient from 0.79 in 1992 to 0.90 in 2008; (2) the most obvious change in urban-area distribution at the national level occurred during the period from 2000 to 2003, which is consistent with turbulent rank changes at the city level; and (3) our combined method revealed another period from 1992 to 1995 with large rank fluctuations, which was masked by the relatively stable Pareto's coefficients extracted at the national level. The results demonstrate that the new DMSP/OLS nighttime light images and the combined method are useful for revealing city-size dynamics in a more consistent way from both national and city perspectives. The results enrich our understanding of city-size evolution and have valuable implications for relevant decision makers and stakeholders.},

	abstract = {As carbon fibers are electrical conductors, the measurement of the electrical resistance appears to be a valuable technique for the in situ detection of various types of damage in carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) laminates. In such cases, carbon fibers are both the reinforcement and the sensor to detect damage in CFRP laminates. The damage-detecting method of CFRP laminates by electrical resistance measurement that are investigated in this study is made possible by attaching electrodes on the surface of the CFRP structures without special manufacturing. In this paper, we investigate the electrical resistance change as a damage parameter of fatigue damage such as the degradation of residual strength and stiffness. The measured stiffness and electrical resistance change during fatigue tests showed a very similar trend of change. This is because cumulative fatigue damage is represented by the degradation of residual stiffness; these damages also cause change in electrical resistance. Thus, we can use this change in electrical resistance as a damage parameter. We also predict the future damage of composite laminates in fatigue loading from electrical resistance damage model by following a stiffness degradation model. Electrical resistance gradually increased as the stiffness reduced, and showed a very abrupt change when final fatigue failure was imminent. The predicted value showed good agreement with the experimental data except in the final stage, where stiffness and electrical resistance changed abruptly.},

	abstract = {A wealth of remotely sensed image time series covering large areas is now available to the earth science community. Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the classification of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component often indicate disturbances (e.g. fires, insect attacks), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.g. change in land cover type). A generic change detection approach is proposed for time series by detecting and characterizing Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonality and noise, and by adding abrupt changes at different times and magnitudes. This revealed that BFAST can robustly detect change with different magnitudes ({\textgreater}0.1 NDVI) within time series with different noise levels (0.01–0.07 σ) and seasonal amplitudes (0.1–0.5 NDVI). Additionally, BFAST was applied to 16-day NDVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites for a forested study area in south eastern Australia. This showed that BFAST is able to detect and characterize spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. BFAST is not specific to a particular data type and can be applied to time series without the need to normalize for land cover types, select a reference period, or change trajectory. The method can be integrated within monitoring frameworks and used as an alarm system to flag when and where changes occur.},

Fossil tufa stromatolites are therefore key targets for reconstructing terrestrial palaeoclimatic, but so far only a few examples have been published. In this research, we studied a 2.5-cm-radius tufa stromatolite from the Eemian of the Somme Basin, Northern France. We show (1) that high-resolution sampling of fossil laminated tufas is highly reproducible. We demonstrate (2) that within the limitations of the δ18O method, NW European Eemian seasonality was essentially similar to the present day. Perhaps most important, we show (3) that precise observations from thin section that match the position of lamina boundaries with the position of reversals in direction of δ18O values are a record of the style or intensity of seasonality. In this French tufa stromatolite, abrupt δ18O reversals do not coincide with sharp lamina boundaries; rather, the lamina boundaries occur where δ18O values are either gradually decreasing or increasing. We interpret this to be a record of abrupt changes in the growth rate, accelerating in spring or early summer and decelerating in late autumn or early winter. This contrasts with a published montane record from the Eemian of Greece, where lamina boundaries and δ18O reversals do coincide, interpreted as more extreme seasonality caused by cessations in growth due to summer aridity or winter cold. We thus propose this criterion as a method to help identify regional styles of seasonality in tufa stromatolites.},

Noises are then eliminated to analyze the intrinsic dynamics and consequently, the denoised time-evolving RQA diversely characterizes the properties of the signal and marks crucial points more accurately where white bands in the RP occur, whereas a strongly qualitative agreement exists between all the non-denoised RQA measures. Generally, the EMD combining with the recurrence analysis sheds more reliable, abundant and inherent lights into the traffic flow, which is meaningful to the empirical analysis of complex systems.},

In some real life applications, abrupt changes in the hazard function may be observed and it is of interest to detect the location and the size of the change. Hazard models with a change-point are considered when the observations are subject to random left truncation and right censoring. For a piecewise constant hazard function with a single change-point, two estimation methods based on the maximum likelihood ideas are considered. The first method assumes parametric families of distributions for the censoring and truncation variables, whereas the second one is based on conditional likelihood approaches. A simulation study is carried out to illustrate the performances of the proposed estimators. The results indicate that the fully parametric method performs better especially for estimating the size of the change, however the difference between the two methods vanish as the sample size increases. It is also observed that the full likelihood approach is not robust to model misspecification.},

We describe a method developed for geological purposes, using the information theory, that enables selection of the most relevant variables. This technique also allows the examination of the asymmetrical relationships between variables. Applied to a set of physical and biological variables (plankton assemblages in four areas of the North Sea), the method shows that biological variables are more informative than physical variables although the controlling factors are mainly physical (sea surface temperature in winter and spring). Among biological variables, diversity measures and warm-water species assemblages are informative for the state of the North Sea pelagic ecosystems while among physical variables sea surface temperature in late winter and early spring are highly informative. Although often used in bioclimatology, the utilisation of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index does not seem to provide a lot of information. The method reveals that only the extreme states of this index has an influence on North Sea pelagic ecosystems. The substantial and persistent changes that were detected in the dynamic regime of the North Sea ecosystems and called regime shift are detected by the method and corresponds to the timing of other shifts described in the literature for some European Systems such as the Baltic and the Mediterranean Sea when both physical and biological variables are considered.},

	abstract = {Microbially mediated smectite illitization has been extensively demonstrated in laboratory experiments. Despite occasional observations in geological environments, the transformation mechanism is still poorly understood. Here we investigated a series of volcanic ash (tephra) samples from the Permo-Triassic boundary (PTB) successions of South China, using short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy, in combination with XRD, MIR, EPMA, SEM, TEM, and 27Al NMR analyses, in order to establish a better understanding of microbial illitization, and to test the applicability of SWIR as a monitor for this process. Mixed-layer illite-smectite (I-Sm) clays are the predominant clay minerals, with illite percentages ranging from 32 to 93\%. The (060) value of I-Sm varies from 1.4956 to 1.4996Å, indicating a dioctahedral precursor smectite. The precursor smectite of I-Sm is nearly free of Fe, and is probably montmorillonite. The b-cell dimension (b0 parameter) exhibits a positive correlation with the illite percentage of I-Sm, suggesting that the illitization occurs with significant cation substitutions. The different spectroscopic results all indicate that tetrahedral Al substitutes for Si, and octahedral Al is mainly substituted by Mg and/or Fe with illitization, consistent with the findings of XRD analysis. Chemical compositions and trends in their variation show typical features of a dissolution-precipitation (DP) mechanism. The SEM images reveal abrupt changes in morphology and the TEM analyses suggest progressive changes in polytype with illitization, also supporting the DP process. The transformation mechanism of I-Sm contradicts the conventional wisdom concerning diagenetic bentonite I-Sm, similar to that of hydrothermal origin, probably as the result of to the involvement of microorganisms. The SWIR parameters, such as position, depth, area and asymmetry of the absorption bands, versus illite percentage in I-Sm, generally give good correlations. SWIR spectroscopy is demonstrated as a valuable method to identify I-Sm with different percentages of illite, and with a capability as a sensitive monitor for I-Sm structure ordering and crystal-chemistry. Thus it can be used as an alternative or complementary method in conventional I-Sm studies, as well as in epithermal and hydrocarbon-reservoir explorations and astrobiological investigations.},

Several postprocessing algorithms, such as susceptibility gradient mapping and phase gradient mapping methods, have been applied for positive contrast generation to detect the cells targeted by superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. In the phase gradient mapping methods, smoothness condition has to be satisfied to keep the phase gradient unwrapped. Moreover, there has been no discussion about the truncation artifact associated with the algorithm of differentiation that is performed in k-space by the multiplication with frequency value. In this work, phase gradient methods are discussed by considering the wrapping problem when the smoothness condition is not satisfied. A region-growing unwrapping algorithm is used in the phase gradient image to solve the problem. In order to reduce the truncation artifact, a cosine function is multiplied in the k-space to eliminate the abrupt change at the boundaries. Simulation, phantom and in vivo experimental results demonstrate that the modified phase gradient mapping methods may produce improved positive contrast effects by reducing truncation or wrapping artifacts.},

	abstract = {Objectives Under the background of global climate change, variations in streamflow and sediment discharge in the Yellow River would continue with intensified human activities and changes in the ecological environment. To harness the Yellow River, analyzing the degrees of change and the reasons for the streamflow and sediment discharge, as well as predicting the future trends, are urgently needed. Methods In this paper, the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test, Sen's estimator of slope, Pettitt's test and wavelet transform were applied to detect the trends, the magnitude of the trends and the abrupt changes and periodic variation in streamflow and suspended sediment discharge at eight hydrological stations from 1950 to 2013 along the mainstream of the Yellow River. Results Over the past 64years (1950–2013), the spatial distribution of the annual average streamflow was of the “M” type, and the annual average suspended sediment discharge had a parabolic curve shape along the mainstream of the Yellow River. The temporal variation showed a distinct decreasing trend in streamflow since the 1990s and in suspended sediment discharge since the 1980s. Many cycles of oscillations occurred in the streamflow and suspended sediment discharge variation, leading to an alternate change in the wet/dry periods and the high/low sediment discharge periods. Conclusions In various regions of the Yellow River Basin since the 1970s, climate changes contributed reductions of 17.0–45.0\% and 12.2–50.3\% for streamflow and suspended sediment discharge, respectively, whereas human activities contributed reductions of 55.0–83.0\% and 49.7–87.8\%. Therefore, human activities were the major causes of the significant decline in the streamflow and the suspended sediment discharge of the Yellow River over the past six decades. Reasonable and possible measures should be taken to achieve water resources optimization and configuration and to promote watershed management and sustainability in the regions of the Yellow River Basin.},

We systematically study the effect of gas and particle properties on the minimum bubbling velocity of Geldart A particles in gas-fluidized beds using both Eulerian–Eulerian and Eulerian–Lagrangian models. We find that the minimum bubbling velocities as obtained from the simulations are in reasonable agreement with the well-known experimental correlation of Abrahamsen and Geldart (Powder Technology, 1980, 26: 35–46). To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the minimum bubbling velocity is correctly predicted by Eulerian–Eulerian models, without using an artificial ad-hoc modification of the gas–solid interaction force. Furthermore, we have performed a systematic investigation into the effect of the specific method that is used for determining minimum bubbling velocity. Our simulations show that the minimum bubbling velocity that would be obtained from the simulated bed contraction is larger than the one obtained from visual observation, which in its turn exceeds the one obtained from sudden change of standard deviation of pressure drop. We find that the abrupt change of the granular temperature with increasing superficial gas velocity may be a more suitable indicator for identifying the onset of heterogeneous fluidization.},

	abstract = {We investigated sea surface temperature (SST) variability over large spatial and temporal scales for the continental shelf region located off the northeast coast of the United States between Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and the Gulf of Maine using the extended reconstruction sea surface temperature (ERSST) dataset. The ERSST dataset consists of 2°×2° (latitude and longitude) monthly mean values computed from in situ data derived from the International Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS). Nineteen 2°×2° bins were chosen that cover the shelf region of interest between the years of 1854 and 2005. Mean annual and range of SST were examined using dynamic factor analysis to estimate trends in both parameters, while chronological clustering was used to determine temporal SST patterns and breakpoints in the time series that are believed to signal regime shifts in SST. Both SST and SST trend analysis show that interannual variability of SST fluctuations shows strong coherence between bins, with declining SST at the beginning of the last century, followed by increasing SST through 1950, and then rapidly decreasing between 1950 and mid-1960s, with somewhat warmer SST thereafter to present. Annual SST range decreases in a seaward direction for all bins, with strong coherence for interannual variability of range fluctuations between bins. The trend in SST range shows a decreasing range at the beginning of the last century followed by an increase in range from 1920 to the late-1980s, remaining high through present with some spatial variability. A more detailed spatial analysis was conducted by grouping the data into 7 regions using principal component analysis. We analyzed regional trends in mean annual SST, seasonal SST range (summer SST−winter SST), and normalized SST minima and maxima. Both the summer and winter seasons were also analyzed using the length of each season and amplitude of the warming and cooling season, respectively, along with the spring warming and fall cooling rates. Trends in all of the parameters were examined after low-pass filtering using a 10-point convolution filter (n=10 years) and regime shifts were identified using the sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts (STARS) method. The analysis shows some difference between regions in the timing of minimum SST with minima being reached 1 month earlier in the south (February) relative to more northern regions (March). Regional annual SST range decreased in a seaward direction. Amplitude of summer warming and the length of summer have shown fluctuations with recent years showing stronger warming and longer summers but generally not exceeding past levels. Overall, the difference in SST range, with recent larger values may be the most significant finding of this work. SST range changes have the potential to disrupt species important to local fisheries due to combinations of differing temperature tolerances, changes in reproduction potential, and changes in the distributional range of species.},

	abstract = {Impacts of vegetation change on streamflow have long been an issue for concern and climate variability can also greatly affect streamflow. Climate change refers to the persistent change in climate over long periods of time due to either natural or as a result of human activity. It is very important to quantify the contribution of climate change and human activities on the change of streamflow and provide a scientific basis for future land conservation planning and river ecological conservation. In this study, non-parametric Pettitt mutation method was employed to detect trends and changes in annual streamflow for the period of 1961 to 2008 in the Da River Basin (55000km2), which is the most important tributary of Red River. An upward trend was found in annual streamflow, with an abrupt change identified in 1993 at the Laichau and Tabu stations in the upstream of the Hoa Binh Reservoir. In addition, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from 1981 to 2006 was used to detect vegetation change in the past 26 years. The difference between average annual accumulated NDVI during before and after 1993 and linear slope of annual accumulated NDVI from 1982 to 2006 was calculated. The discharge data was divided into a baseline period (before 1993) and a period of change. Sensitivity-based method and model simulation method were then proposed to separate different effects from climate and human activities. Results indicated that the streamflow is more sensitive to precipitation than potential evaportransportation (PET). Effects of climate variability on streamflow estimated using the sensitivity-based method was weak in the downsream catchment of Tabu station, and strong in the upstream catchment of Laichau station, where the climate effects accounted for about 30\% of total streamflow changes. Effects of human activities on streamflow accounted for about 60\% both in the Laichau and Tabu catchments. Human activities are the main factor to affect the changes of inflow into the Hoa Binh Reservoir, and climate change also plays an important role.},

	abstract = {Technological advancements can influence both the fishing power of a fleet and the fishing strategies it employs. To investigate these potential linkages, we examined almost three decades of data (1981–2008) from French tropical tuna purse seiners operating in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Applying a sequence of statistical methods at different temporal and spatial scales, we analyzed two indicators of fishing power (sets per boat-day on fish aggregating devices (FADs) and sets per boat-day on free-swimming schools) each of which represent a distinct fishing mode. Our results show that the increasing modernization of this fleet has led to increases in both fishing power and the available number of fishing strategies to choose from. A key output of this analysis was the breakdown of fishing power time series (for each fishing mode) into separate periods of continuous years during which catchability was assumed to be constant, thus identifying regime shifts. This partitioning allowed us to identify when key changes occurred in the fishery. Changes in FAD-associated fishing were mostly driven by the introduction of radio beacons (early 1990s) which lead to an increase in fishing effort and an expansion of fishing grounds (direct effect) and the implementation of time-area management measures which resulted in a fragmentation of the traditional fishing grounds in the 2000s (indirect effect). During the same period, fishing on free-swimming schools also increased despite the biomass of stocks decreasing and fishing grounds remaining unchanged. This suggests these increases were driven by improvements in fish detection technology (e.g., bird radars, sonar). These identified increases are not entirely unexpected: indeed it is widely recognized that fishing power in the purse seine tuna fishery has increased over time. However, these increases do not necessarily occur linearly. Thus, understanding how fishing power is changing over time (such as determining when regime shifts occur) is critical to improving the CPUE standardization procedure in tropical tuna purse seine fisheries.},

Despite this, numerous states are considering medical or recreational legalization. In the context of abrupt changes in marijuana policy in 2009 in Colorado, the authors sought to investigate corresponding changes in marijuana-related public health indicators. Methods This observational, ecologic study used an interrupted time-series analysis to identify changes in public health indicators potentially related to broad policy changes that occurred in 2009. This was records-based research from the state of Colorado and Denver metropolitan area. Data were collected to examine frequency and trends of marijuana-related outcomes in hospital discharges and poison center calls between time periods before and after 2009 and adjusted for population. Analyses were conducted in 2014. Results Hospital discharges coded as marijuana-dependent increased 1\% per month (95\% CI=0.8, 1.1, p{\textless}0.001) from 2007 to 2013. A change in trend was detected in poison center calls mentioning marijuana (p{\textless}0.01). After 2009, poison center calls increased 0.8\% per month (95\% CI=0.2, 1.4, p{\textless}0.01). Poison center calls also increased 56\% (95\% CI=49\%, 63\%, p{\textless}0.001) in the period following the policy change. Further, there was one hospital discharge coded as dependent for every 3,159 (95\% CI=2465, 3853, p{\textless}0.001) medical marijuana registrant applications. Conclusions The abrupt nature of these changes suggests public health effects related to broad policy changes associated with marijuana.

The change results showed continuous decline of forest lands throughout the first (1973–1985), second (1985–1995), third (1995–2003) and fourth (2003–2015) periods by 37.6\%, 43.2\%, 26.9\% and 31.5\% respectively. Grasslands also decreased in all the four periods by 4.6\%, 13.6\%, 19.5\% and 11.4\% respectively. On the other hand, agricultural lands increased by 28.2\% in the first, 23\% in the second, 20.7\% in third and 11.7\% in the fourth periods. All in all, about 60.1\% of the land experienced changes in LULC in 42 years. The identified causes were population pressure and associated demands (e.g increasing wood extraction for fuel), regime changes, interventions and programs implemented in the area. We conclude that previously introduced strategies could not stop the decline of vegetation (e.g. forests and grasslands) in the study area. We suggest sustainable land use planning and management, proper implementation of different strategies together with local communities and further studies to explore alternative strategies.},

	abstract = {An effective method for detecting cracks in plate structures based on fractal dimension analysis is presented in this paper. The method is applied to the simulated fundamental vibration mode of a simply supported rectangular plate containing a crack parallel to one of its edges of arbitrary length, depth and location. The analyzed spatial response by exhibiting abrupt changes at the site of the crack allows for an accurate determination of the location and length of the crack. Additionally, the dependence of both the maximum value and the energy of the estimated fractal dimension on crack depth provide a quantitative means for the estimation of the depth of the crack. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated using various examples for plates, concerning the depth, length and position of the crack. Finally, the sensitivity of the method to additive random signal noise is systematically investigated using a noise stress test. The ability of the proposed method to accurately identify the location, length and depth of cracks despite the presence of noise and its computational simplicity make it an attractive tool for practical applications in non-destructive damage identification in structures.},

	abstract = {Hydrological regimes of river systems have been changing under the impacts of both climate variation and human activities in the global context. The Luodingjiang River, a mountainous tributary of the lower Xijiang in South China, was chosen to investigate the hydrological responses to the precipitation variation and diverse human activities (land use change, water diversion, reservoir construction, and in-channel damming) in this study. Two non-parametric statistical methods, Mann–Kendall and Pettitt test, were employed to detect the long-term changes in the time series of water discharge and sediment load (1959–2002) at the annual, monthly and seasonal scales. Significant increasing changes were detected in the water discharge time series in the dry season. To the contrary, significant decreasing changes were detected in the annual sediment load and sediment load time series in the wet-season. The impacts of precipitation variation and human activities on water discharge and sediment load were discerned and quantified using double mass curve and linear regression methods. By taking the period 1959–1968 as the reference period, the contribution of human activities to the increasing trend of dry-season water discharge in the period 1969–2002 was estimated to be 80\%. Because the change of sediment load during the period 1969–2002 was not monotonic with an abrupt change around 1986, the contribution estimations were made for the two periods before and after 1986 respectively. For the period 1969–1985, human activities, particularly deforestation during the period 1981–1985, contributed 43\% to the increasing change of sediment load and for the period 1986–2002, the impact of human activities dominated the decreasing change of sediment load with the contribution slightly higher than 100\% because of the opposite role of precipitation variation. The operation of reservoirs and hydropower stations is considered to be responsible for the observed increasing trends of water discharge in the dry-season and decreasing trends of sediment load after 1986, and for the latter, reforestation program in the catchment is another contributing factor. The distinct seasonal changing patterns of both water discharge and sediment load in this study highlight the importance of involving monthly or seasonal time series in the change detection in hydrological data.},

Furthermore, the phase is subject to cycle slips. These abrupt changes must be detected and repaired.

Results based on digital elevation model (DEM) analyses and stream extractions are generally intended to determine crustal uplift rates and identify transient landscape conditions. In this article, we present an alternative geomorphometric method for locating knickpoints and knickzones based on local slope gradient and curvature attributes. Intended as a rapid, regional scale, automated knickpoint detection technique, the accuracy of this slope–curvature method is tested on two digital elevation grids, NASA's SRTM (ground resolution of 90m, resampled here to 75m) and the ASTER DEM (15m) in the Sierra Nacimiento (New Mexico, USA), a basement-cored mountain range recently exhumed by waves of headward drainage integration in response to remote tectonic deformation in the adjacent Rio Grande rift. Out of every 10 gradient anomalies detected by the SRTM-derived numeric routine, up to 8 are certifiable knickpoints recognized among a population of georeferenced occurrences surveyed in the field. An independent comparison with the slope–area method provided a further accuracy test, which was particularly useful at sites that could not be validated in the field for practical reasons. Given the low tectonic activity of the study area, the majority of knickpoints was also found to coincide with lithologic boundaries, making it difficult without further geomorphological data to single out dynamic knickpoints directly caused by the upstream propagation of channel instabilities relating to base level change.},

	abstract = {The move to ecosystem-based management of marine fisheries and endangered species would be greatly facilitated by a quantitative method for identifying marine ecosystems that captures temporal dynamics at meso-scale (10s or 100s of kilometers) resolutions. Understanding the dynamics of ecosystem boundaries, which may differ according to the species of interest or the management objectives, is a fundamental challenge of ecosystem-based management. We present an adaptive ecosystem classification that begins to address these challenges. To demonstrate the approach, we quantitatively bounded distinct, biologically meaningful marine regions in the North Pacific Ocean based on physical oceanography. We identified the regions by applying image classification algorithms to a comprehensive description of the ocean's surface, derived from an oceanographic circulation model. Our resulting maps illustrate 15 distinct marine regions. The size and location of these regions related well to previously described water masses in the North Pacific. We investigated seasonal and long-term changes in the pattern of regions and their boundaries by dividing the oceanographic data into four seasons and two 10-year time periods, one on either side of the 1976–1977 North Pacific Ocean climate regime shift. We compared our results for each season across the regime shift and for sequential seasons within regimes using the Kappa Index of Agreement and the index of Average Mutual Information. Seasonal patterns were more similar between regimes than from one season to the next within a regime, while the magnitude of seasonal transitions appeared to differ before and after the regime shift. We assessed the biological relevance of the identified regions using seasonal maps derived from remotely sensed chlorophyll-a concentrations ([chl-a]). We used Kruskal–Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests to evaluate the correspondence between the [chl-a] maps and our post-regime shift regions. There was a significant difference in [chl-a] among the regions in all seasons. We found that the number of regions with distinct chlorophyll signatures, and the associations between different regions, varied by season. The overall pattern of association between the regions was suggestive of observed, broad-scale patterns in the seasonal development and distribution of primary production in the North Pacific. This demonstrated that regions with different biological properties can be delineated using only physical variables. The flexibility of our approach will enable researchers to visualize the geographic extents of regions with similar physical conditions, providing insight into ocean dynamics and changes in marine ecosystems. It will also provide resource managers with a powerful tool for broad application in ecosystem-based management and conservation of marine resources.},

	abstract = {The radial basis function has been widely used in constructing metamodels as response surfaces. Yet, it often faces the challenge of accuracy if a sequential sampling strategy is used to insert samples sequentially and refine the models, especially under the constraint of computational resources. In this paper, a sensitive region pursuing based active learning radial basis function (SRP-ALRBF) metamodeling approach is proposed to sequentially exploit the already-acquired knowledge in the modeling process for obtaining a desirable estimation of the relationship between the input design variables and the output response. In this method, the leave-one-out (LOO) errors of each sample point are taken to identify the boundaries of sensitive regions. According to the obtained LOO information, the original design space is divided into some subspaces by adopting the self-organization maps (SOMs). The boundary of the most sensitive region, where the output response is multi-modal or non-smooth with abrupt changes, is determined by the topological graph generated by cluster analysis in SOMs. In the most sensitive region, infill sample point searching is performed based on an optimization formulation. Ten numerical examples are used to compare the proposed SRP-ALRBF with four existing active learning RBF metamodeling approaches. Results show the advantage of the proposed SRP-ALRBF approach in both prediction accuracy and robustness. It is also applied to three engineering cases to illustrate its ability to support complex engineering design.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the impacts of climate and human activities on water and sediment discharge has become a central topic in climate and hydrologic research. This issue, however, has so far received little attention in karst regions around the world. Seven karst catchments located in southwest China were chosen to explore water and sediment discharge responses to different driving factors during the period from the 1950sto 2011. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was used to detect both the trends and abrupt changes in water and sediment discharge. The double mass curve method was used to quantify the effects of climate and human activities on water and sediment discharge. Results indicated that the annual water discharge showed a decreasing trend in all catchments (−0.21 to −3.68×108m3yr−1), and the sediment discharge exhibited a significant decreasing trend (−7 to −101×104tyr−1) for six out of the seven catchments. A rapid decline (abrupt change) in sediment discharge occurred since 2000 for all except Liujiang catchment where the sediment discharge has a slight increase since 1983 as no large dams were constructed in this catchment. Specifically, the magnitude of reduction in sediment discharge (\%) significantly increases with the extent of flow regulation as measured by the ratio of the area upstream the dam to the total catchment area for the seven catchments (R2=0.98, P{\textless}0.01). This study demonstrated that water discharge was mainly influenced by precipitation, while sediment discharge was mainly influenced by human activities (relative contribution 70–111\%, regardless of whether the effect is negative or positive). Ecological restoration played somehow important roles in the decrease in sediment discharge (negative relationships of sediment discharge with the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI)), but dam construction was likely to be the principal cause of the significant decrease in sediment discharge. This study is of use for better catchment management in karst regions in southwest of China.},

The ability to accurately distinguish radiological threat-generated gamma-ray signatures from background gamma radiation in real time is essential in order to realize this potential. This problem is non-trivial, especially in urban environments for which the background may change very rapidly during flight. This exacerbates the challenge of estimating background due to the poor counting statistics inherent in real-time airborne gamma-ray spectroscopy measurements. To address this challenge, we have developed a new technique for real-time estimation of background gamma radiation from aerial measurements without the need for human analyst intervention. The method can be calibrated using radiation transport simulations along with data from previous flights over areas for which the isotopic composition need not be known. Over the examined measured and simulated data sets, the method generated accurate background estimates even in the presence of a strong, 60Co source. The potential to track large and abrupt changes in background spectral shape and magnitude was demonstrated. The method can be implemented fairly easily in most modern computing languages and environments.},

	abstract = {This article reviews Bayesian analysis methods applied to extreme climatic data. We particularly focus on applications to three different problems related to extreme climatic events including detection of abrupt regime shifts, clustering tropical cyclone tracks, and statistical forecasting for seasonal tropical cyclone activity. For identifying potential change points in an extreme event count series, a hierarchical Bayesian framework involving three layers – data, parameter, and hypothesis – is formulated to demonstrate the posterior probability of the shifts throughout the time. For the data layer, a Poisson process with a gamma distributed rate is presumed. For the hypothesis layer, multiple candidate hypotheses with different change-points are considered. To calculate the posterior probability for each hypothesis and its associated parameters we developed an exact analytical formula, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, and a more sophisticated reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm. The algorithms are applied to several rare event series: the annual tropical cyclone or typhoon counts over the central, eastern, and western North Pacific; the annual extremely heavy rainfall event counts at Manoa, Hawaii; and the annual heat wave frequency in France. Using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, a Bayesian clustering method built on a mixture Gaussian model is applied to objectively classify historical, spaghetti-like tropical cyclone tracks (1945–2007) over the western North Pacific and the South China Sea into eight distinct track types. A regression based approach to forecasting seasonal tropical cyclone frequency in a region is developed. Specifically, by adopting large-scale environmental conditions prior to the tropical cyclone season, a Poisson regression model is built for predicting seasonal tropical cyclone counts, and a probit regression model is alternatively developed toward a binary classification problem. With a non-informative prior assumption for the model parameters, a Bayesian inference for the Poisson regression model and the probit regression model are derived in parallel. A Gibbs sampler is further designed to integrate the posterior predictive distribution. The resulting Bayesian Poisson regression algorithm is applied to predicting the seasonal tropical cyclone activity.},

	abstract = {Travel time is an important index for managers to evaluate the performance of transportation systems and an intuitive measure for travelers to choose routes and departure times. An important part of the literature focuses on predicting instantaneous travel time under recurrent traffic conditions to disseminate traffic information. However, accurate travel time prediction is important for assessing the effects of abnormal traffic conditions and helping travelers make reliable travel decisions under such conditions. This study proposes an online travel time prediction model with emphasis on capturing the effects of anomalies. The model divides a path into short links. A Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) framework is adopted to forecast link travel times based on historical data and real-time measurements. Furthermore, a probabilistic nested delay operator is used to calculate path travel time distributions. To ensure that the algorithm is fast enough for online applications, parallel computation architecture is introduced to overcome the computational burden of the FPCA. Finally, a rolling horizon structure is applied to online travel time prediction. Empirical results for Guangzhou Airport Expressway indicate that the proposed method can capture an abrupt change in traffic state and provide a promising and reliable travel time prediction at both the link and path levels. In the case where the original FPCA is modified for parallelization, accuracy and computational effort are evaluated and compared with those of the sequential algorithm. The proposed algorithm is found to require only a piece rather than a large set of traffic incident records.},

The online data gathered during the study was evaluated with Self-Organising Map (SOM) and Sammon's mapping, which are useful methods in exploring large amounts of multivariate data. The objective was to test the usefulness of these methods in pinpointing the abnormal water quality changes in the online data. The pressure shocks increased temporarily the number of particles, turbidity and electrical conductivity. SOM and Sammon's mapping were able to separate these situations from the normal data and thus make those visible. Therefore these methods make it possible to detect abrupt changes in water quality and thus to react rapidly to any disturbances in the system.

	abstract = {There is growing realization that on-line model maintenance is the key to realizing long term benefits of a predictive control scheme. In this work, a novel intelligent nonlinear state estimation strategy is proposed, which keeps diagnosing the root cause(s) of the plant model mismatch by isolating the subset of active faults (abrupt changes in parameters/disturbances, biases in sensors/actuators, actuator/sensor failures) and auto-corrects the model on-line so as to accommodate the isolated faults/failures. To carry out the task of fault diagnosis in multivariate nonlinear time varying systems, we propose a nonlinear version of the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) based fault diagnosis and identification (FDI) scheme (NL-GLR). An active fault tolerant NMPC (FTNMPC) scheme is developed that makes use of the fault/failure location and magnitude estimates generated by NL-GLR to correct the state estimator and prediction model used in NMPC formulation. This facilitates application of the fault tolerant scheme to nonlinear and time varying processes including batch and semi-batch processes. The advantages of the proposed intelligent state estimation and FTNMPC schemes are demonstrated by conducting simulation studies on a benchmark CSTR system, which exhibits input multiplicity and change in the sign of steady state gain, and a fed batch bioreactor, which exhibits strongly nonlinear dynamics. By simulating a regulatory control problem associated with an unstable nonlinear system given by Chen and Allgower [H. Chen, F. Allgower, A quasi infinite horizon nonlinear model predictive control scheme with guaranteed stability, Automatica 34(10) (1998) 1205–1217], we also demonstrate that the proposed intelligent state estimation strategy can be used to maintain asymptotic closed loop stability in the face of abrupt changes in model parameters. Analysis of the simulation results reveals that the proposed approach provides a comprehensive method for treating both faults (biases/drifts in sensors/actuators/model parameters) and failures (sensor/ actuator failures) under the unified framework of fault tolerant nonlinear predictive control.},

In particular, singularity analysis across all scales of the continuous wavelet transform is performed to identify the location (in time) of defect-induced bursts in the vibration signals. Through modifying the intensity of the wavelet transform modulus maxima, defect-related vibration signature is highlighted and can be easily associated with the bearing defect characteristic frequencies for diagnosis. Due to the fact that vibration characteristics of faulty bearings are complex and defect-related vibration signature is normally buried in the wideband noise and high frequency structural resonance, simple signal processing cannot be used to detect bearing fault. We show, through experimental results, that the proposed method has the ability to discriminate noise from the signal significantly and is robust to bearing operating conditions, such as load and speed, and severity of the bearing damage. These properties are desirable for automatic detection of machine faults.},

Temperature dependencies of the electrical parameters show abrupt jumps associated with the α↔β-LMO phase transition, which is also detected by X-ray powder diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry analyses. Electrical relaxation phenomena are analyzed in terms of the relaxation time distribution function. Four different relaxation processes are identified and attributed to processes in the ceramics’ grains and grain boundary media. Detailed analysis of these processes reveals surprising findings about the nature of the α↔β-LMO phase transition, indicating that the abrupt change in LMO compound’s resistivity is associated not only with a change in the relative volume of the different phases, but also with an alteration of the β-LMO phase itself; thus the α↔β-LMO phase transition is found to have properties of I and II order phase transitions.

	abstract = {Palm pressed fibre (PPF) is one of the by-products from palm oil milling process which is conventionally burned as fuel to produce energy to support the milling operation. PPF typically contains 5–6\% of residual palm oil, which can be further recovered as by-product before using it as fuel in boiler. Therefore, it has propagated great interest in developing technologies to extract the residual oil from PPF. Based on the currently available technologies, hexane cold extraction is the most established method for recovering the residual oil. However, the extracted residual oil via hexane is not suitable for food applications due to the toxicity of hexane. Besides, the low recovery of carotene from the residual oil is another major concern of using hexane as solvent in the cold extraction. Therefore, there is a need to identify an alternative solvent to recover the residual oil from PPF. In this work, Computer Aided Molecular Design (CAMD) technique is adapted to identify alternative solvents which possess the most desirable attributes for this application. This application of CAMD is unique because it is important to optimize the physical properties of the potential solvent along with safety and health attributes in order to use in food industries. Moreover, the safety and health indexes depend on the physical properties of the final solvent and the abrupt changes of these indexes must be tracked simultaneously with the changes in properties. The proposed approach can identify alternative solvents that extract residual oil from PPF with the highest retention of carotene. To trade off the optimisation objective of the recovery of carotene and total health and safety impacts, fuzzy optimisation based approach for solvent design has been developed.},

A novel method to extract a satellite-derived shoreline (SDS) was developed ensuring the maximum contrast between sea and land. The area under investigation is an 8km length of shoreline that faces north into the Gulf of México. The SDS was validated using quasi-simultaneous in situ shoreline measurements, both adjusted to equal water levels. In situ shoreline measurements recorded the instantaneous shoreward extent of the wave run-up when walking along the beach. The validation of SDS revealed that the SDS is located consistently seawards of the in situ shoreline, explained by: a) the water depth that optical satellite image requires to identify a pixel either as sea or land, and b) the shoreward extent of the wave run-up. The overall distance between SDS and in situ shoreline is 5.6m on average with a standard deviation of 1.37m (in the horizontal) over 8km of shoreline. Confidence bounds considering the shoreward extent of the wave run-up, inter-tidal beach slope variation and tidal uncertainty were computed to assess the accuracy of the SDS. The SDS has been shown to be capable of detecting shoreline changes of less than 10m and abrupt changes due to storms. The success of our method suggests that it should be applicable to other locations, after adapting the confidence bounds to the beach conditions.},

This creates a phenomenon called volatility clustering, where large price movements on one day are followed by similarly large movements on successive days, creating temporal clusters. The GARCH model, which treats volatility as a drift process, is commonly used to capture this behaviour. However research suggests that volatility is often better described by a structural break model, where the volatility undergoes abrupt jumps in addition to drift. Most efforts to integrate these jumps into the GARCH methodology have resulted in models which are either very computationally demanding, or which make problematic assumptions about the distribution of the instruments, often assuming that they are Gaussian. We present a new approach which uses ideas from nonparametric statistics to identify structural break points without making such distributional assumptions, and then models drift separately within each identified regime. Using our method, we investigate the volatility of several major stock indexes, and find that our approach can potentially give an improved fit compared to more commonly used techniques.},

A formal proof is provided for the limiting distributions of the various tests for the regime shift model (both a level and slope change). Critical values are calculated for the tests by simulation methods and a simple Monte Carlo experiment is conducted to evaluate finite-sample performance. In the limited set of experiments, we find that the tests can detect cointegrating relations when there is a break in the intercept and/or slope coefficient. For these same experiments, the power of the conventional ADF test with no allowance for regime shifts falls sharply. As an illustration we test for structural breaks in the U.S. long-run money-demand equation using annual and quarterly data.},

The accuracy of the grid transformation metrics is affected by the inverse metrics, which are spatial derivatives of the grid in the generalised coordinates. The truncation errors contained in the inverse metrics are generated by the spatial schemes. Fourier analysis shows that the dispersion errors, by spatial schemes, have similarities to the transfer function of spatial filters. This similarity is exploited to define a grid quality metric that can be used to identify areas in the mesh that are likely to generate significant grid-induced errors. An inviscid vortex convection benchmark case is used to quantify the correlation between the grid quality metric and the solution accuracy, for three common geometric features found in grids: abrupt changes in the grid metrics, skewness, and grid stretching.

Trends in extreme precipitation indices have mixed patterns over the intersection regions between Shandong and Jiangsu, where the increases in drought-flood disasters may be dramatic. Regional extreme precipitation indices in CDD and SDII show significant positive trends even though the annual total wet day precipitation (PRCPTOT) has a significant decline trend, this suggests that the increases in intensity of precipitation cannot counteract the decreases in other wet-related indices and the YSWC tends to be drier conditions. The temporal variability in seasonal indices of max 1-day precipitation (RX1day) and max 5-day precipitation (RX5day) shows that winter is becoming the wettest season. And the abrupt shift of precipitation regime in the later 1970s is detected for several indices. Factor analysis indicates that the changes in precipitation extremes, rather moderate rainfall, are of great contributions to the variability of annual total rainfall. There are multiple and overlapping cycles for most precipitation indices during 1951–2011, suggesting variations of time and frequency, while the 12–15-year cycle is prevailing for some indices. Further analyses indicate that global warming, coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena, and urbanization are three major forcing factors affecting the variations in precipitation extremes over the YSWC during last decades.},

The TOP method consists in searching for a robust noise-averaged optimal path of the distance matrix along which the two time series have the greatest similarity. Here, we generalize the TOP method by introducing a more general definition of distance which takes into account possible regime shifts between positive and negative correlations. This generalization to track possible changes of correlation signs is able to identify possible transitions from one convention (or consensus) to another. Numerical simulations on synthetic time series verify that the new TOP method performs as expected even in the presence of substantial noise. We then apply it to investigate changes of convention in the dependence structure between the historical volatilities of the USA inflation rate and economic growth rate. Several measures show that the new TOP method significantly outperforms standard cross-correlation methods.},

The key idea is to decompose the fault signals, de-noised using the adaptive whitening filter, into effective detailed and smoothed version using the multiresolution signal decomposition technique based on discrete wavelet transform. Then we apply the threshold method on the decomposed signals to estimate the change time-instants, segmenting the fault signals into the event-specific sections for further signal processing and analysis.

Every hour the hourly electrical load for refrigeration is forecasted for the following 42h. The forecast models are adaptive linear time series models. The model has two regimes; one for opening hours and one for closing hours, this is modeled by a regime switching model and two different methods for predicting the regimes are tested. The dynamic relation between the weather and the load is modeled by simple transfer functions and the non-linearities are described using spline functions. The results are thoroughly evaluated and it is shown that the spline functions are suitable for handling the non-linear relations and that after applying an auto-regressive noise model the one-step ahead residuals do not contain further significant information.},

The median time from abnormality identification until termination was 16.5 days (range 2–73). The major themes for termination timing included (1) an abrupt shift in “low-risk” pregnancy perception; (2) challenging medical interactions; (3) an emotional decision-making process; and (4) termination access barriers. Conclusions Timing of termination for fetal abnormalities is attributable to multiple issues.

	abstract = {Evapotranspiration is an important flux term in the water cycle that integrates atmospheric demands and surface conditions. Thus, analysis of the temporal variation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) will help us to understand climate change and its effect on hydrology. In this paper, we present an analysis of the monthly ET0 at 15 stations during 1961–2005 in the Taoer River basin in China, calculated by the FAO Penman–Monteith method. We derived the growing season and annual total ET0 time series and using the Mann–Kendall method, moving t test and Morlet wavelet conducted comprehensive time series analysis to characterize significance test, abrupt change and period in the ET0 data sets. The results present that: (i) in terms of the seasonal cycle, monthly ET0 reaches its peak in May and growing season ET0 accounts for 60.7\% of annual total. Long term growing season ET0 fluctuates in accordance with annual ET0, both having turning points in 1982 and 1993; (ii) with respect to the long term persistence, the trends for growing season and annual ET0 show the same spatial patterns: high positive values in the west study area in the upper reach and negative values in the Southeast study area in the lower reach. The spatial distribution of annual tendencies suggests an influence from the altitude and latitude; (iii) for individual station, abrupt changes in annual ET0 are more pronounced than those in growing season ET0. The timings for the abrupt changes in ET0 series at individual stations are consistent with those in regional ET0. Abrupt changes detected in the early 1980s are all increasing changes, while those in earlier 1990 are all decreasing changes; and (iv) based on the Morlet wavelet analysis, there exist significant periods of 1, 3 and 7.3 years in annual ET0 series and significant 1 year period and 7.3 years period in growing season ET0 series. Maximum air temperature, mean air temperature, relative humidity and bright sunshine hours are main climate variables responsible for the periodicity in ET0.},

Based on meteorological station records during 1960–2016, we detected the variations of air temperature and precipitation by using non-parametric method in the different sub-regions and different elevations of the Tianshan Mountains. The mutations of climate were investigated by Mann-Kendall abrupt change test in the sub-regions. The periodicity is examined by wavelet analysis employing a chi-square test and detecting significant time sections. The results show that the Tianshan Mountains experienced an overall rapid warming and wetting during study period, with average warming rate of 0.32°C/10a and wet rate of 5.82mm/10a, respectively. The annual and seasonal spatial variation of temperature showed different scales in different regions. The annual precipitation showed non-significant upward trend in 20 stations, and 6 stations showed a significant upward trend. The temperatures in the East Tianshan increased most rapidly at rates of 0.41°C/10a. The increasing magnitudes of annual precipitation were highest in the Boertala Vally (8.07mm/10a) and lowest in the East Tianshan (2.64mm/10a). The greatest and weakest warming was below 500m (0.42°C/10a) and elevation of 1000–1500m (0.23°C/10a), respectively. The increasing magnitudes of annual precipitation were highest in the elevation of 1500m–2000m (9.22mm/10a) and lowest in the elevation of below 500m (3.45mm/10a). The mutations of annual air temperature and precipitation occurred in 1995 and 1990, respectively. The large atmospheric circulation influenced on the mutations of climate. The significant periods of air temperature were 2.4–4.1years, and annual precipitation was 2.5–7.4years. Elevation dependency of temperature trend magnitude was not evidently in the Tianshan Mountains. The annual precipitation wetting trend was amplified with elevation in summer and autumn.

	abstract = {Flooding in the Yellow River basin (YRB) has changed significantly over the last few decades because of climate change and human activities. Determining how the flooding changed and identifying the main driving factors of flood change is crucial to flood risk assessment and water resources planning. However, few studies have been conducted, especially in the whole YRB. To fill this gap, we investigate the spatial and temporal change of the annual maximum flood (AMAXF) in the YRB using observed data from 32 key hydrological stations (including 15 mainstream stations and 17 tributary stations). The Mann–Kendall test combined with trend index method is used to evaluate the trend in precipitation and AMAXF. The trend results indicate the AMAXF over the whole basin is dominated by decreasing trends: 72\% of the stations exhibit significant decreasing trends (at 0.1 significance level) and 22\% of the stations show no significant decreasing trends in the AMAXF. Both flood trends and abrupt change time exhibit obvious regional differences: the flood decreases is more pronounced in the midstream basins than in the headwater of the basin; the abrupt changes mainly occurred in the early 1990s for the upper reaches, and in the late 1990s for the middle reaches. To investigate the causes of flood change, the trends of precipitation extremes are analyzed in relation to the trends of peak floods. The analysis reveals that the decreasing precipitation extremes only results in the AMAXF reduction in the upstream basin. The decreasing AMAXF in the midstream and downstream of the basin are mainly attributable to the impacts of human activities (mainly including dam construction and soil conservation practices). In general, anthropogenic impacts play an increasingly important role in the AMAXF changes in the YRB. According to the possible changes in forcing factors, the AMAXF over the whole basin is expected to further decrease in the near future. However, there are still large flood risks in the tributary basins due to the collapse of check dams caused by extreme storms.},

	abstract = {Background The clinical course of alcohol use disorders (AUD) is marked by great heterogeneity both within and between individuals. One approach to modeling this heterogeneity is latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM), which identifies a number of latent subgroups of drinkers with drinking trajectories that are similar within a latent subgroup but different between subgroups. LGMM is data-driven and uses an iterative process of testing a sequential number researcher-selected of latent subgroups then selecting the best fitting model. Despite the advantages of LGMM (e.g., identifying subgroups among heterogeneous longitudinal data), one limitation is the lack of precision of LGMM to model abrupt changes in drinking during treatment that are often observed by clinicians. Joinpoint analysis (JPA) is a data analysis procedure that is used to identify discrete change points in longitudinal data (e.g., changes from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing). Method This study presents a demonstration of using JPA as a post hoc procedure for LGMM to improve accuracy in modeling abrupt changes in clinical course of AUD. Results Results from this secondary data analysis of 549 AUD participants participating in the NIAAA sponsored relapse replication and extension project uncovered four latent classes of drinking trajectories. Discussion Within these trajectories the addition of JPA improved precision in modeling the clinical course of AUDs.},

The increase in drought has been attributed to global warming. We used the high-accuracy self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) to investigate the variation in drought in China between 1961 and 2009 using the Mann-Kendall (MK), continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and the rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) methods. We also analyzed the relationship between the rotated principal component time series (RPCs) and 74 circulation indices. The results revealed that: 1) all of China experienced a significant wet trend at annual and seasonal scale; an abrupt change in the drought pattern occurred around 1970 with a 2–8-year significant period; 2) eight major sub-climate regions were identified: Northwest China, Northeast-Inner Mongolia Plateau, Greater Khingan Range area, Northern Tibetan Plateau, Southern Tibetan Plateau, Central China, Huang-Huai-Hai Plain and Southeast China. Of these regions, the Southern Tibetan Plateau experienced a significant wet trend, but the Northeast-Inner Mongolia Plateau and Northern Tibetan Plateau became significantly drier. Using either annual or seasonal scales, Northwest China became significantly wetter and Central China became more arid. In addition, the period of each sub-climate region shared a significant 2–8-year band; 3) the polar vortex exhibited dominant patterns that affected most areas of China. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation had a significant influence on drought evolution, especially for Northwest China and the Huang-Huai-Hai plain. Additionally, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation also affected drought evolution, and the Central China was impacted by the Indian Ocean Dipole.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new modeling framework for estimating single-trial event-related potentials (ERPs). Existing studies based on state-space approach use discrete-time random-walk models. We propose to use continuous-time partially observed diffusion process which is more natural and appropriate to describe the continuous dynamics underlying ERPs, discretely observed in noise as single-trials. Moreover, the flexibility of the continuous-time model being specified and analyzed independently of observation intervals, enables a more efficient handling of irregularly or variably sampled ERPs than its discrete-time counterpart which is fixed to a particular interval. We consider the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process for the inter-trial parameter dynamics and further propose a nonlinear process of Cox, Ingersoll \& Ross (CIR) with a heavy-tailed density to better capture the abrupt changes. We also incorporate a single-trial trend component using the mean-reversion variant, and a stochastic volatility noise process. The proposed method is applied to analysis of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). Simulation shows that both diffusions give satisfactory tracking performance, particularly of the abrupt ERP parameter variations by the CIR process. Evaluation on real ABR data across different subjects, stimulus intensities and hearing conditions demonstrates the superiority of our method in extracting the latent single-trial dynamics with significantly improved SNR, and in detecting the wave V which is critical for diagnosis of hearing loss. Estimation results on data with variable sampling frequencies and missing single-trials show that the continuous-time diffusion model can capture more accurately the inter-trial dynamics between varying observation intervals, compared to the discrete-time model.},

	abstract = {A 50,000-year-old sediment core record from Laguna Chaplin is reanalyzed to explore potential paleoecological methods to detect the extent of pre-Columbian disturbance in the Bolivian Amazon. High-resolution (sub-centennial) macrocharcoal data are analyzed using statistical algorithm software including Regime Shift Detection and CHAR Analysis to detect changes in past fire regimes. These data are compared with existing charcoal records from throughout the Bolivian lowlands to provide a regional scale context of past biomass burning. During the mid-Holocene, changes in precipitation are the dominant driver of fire activity and biomass burning at Laguna Chaplin and across the Bolivian lowlands. During the late Holocene, increased fire activity across ecosystems ranging from fire-adapted to fire-intolerant forests is attributed to the apex of pre-Columbian activity. These data suggest human-caused ignitions during the late Holocene are the driving factor of regional scale fire activity in the Bolivian lowlands. After ca. 650 cal yr BP, there is an increase in biomass burning and fire frequency synchronous with the expansion of Moraceae/Urticaceae pollen ({\textgreater}50\%) at Laguna Chaplin. This occurs during the time-transgressive southward expansion of the rainforest boundary, during the apex of pre-Columbian activity in the region. The increase in biomass burning at Laguna Chaplin is reflected at other sites in the region with known human occupation histories. The presence of Zea mays ca. 970 to 170 cal yr BP indicates maize cultivation is practiced in the immediate vicinity surrounding Laguna Chaplin. The simultaneous increase in fire activity with the expansion of the less flammable humid rainforest vegetation suggests human fire management practices. These data are interpreted as the use of frequent, low severity, human-caused fires to clear the croplands from encroaching rainforest vegetation. Despite evidence of pre-Columbian fire management during the late Holocene, vegetation and fire data indicate the extent of human-landscape modification and fire management at Laguna Chaplin, is not enough to inhibit the climate-driven regional forest expansion of the savanna-rainforest ecotonal boundary to its most southern extent in the last 50,000 years.

	abstract = {Summary Natural hydrological regimes are essential to the stability of river basins. While numerous efforts have been put forth to characterize flow regime alterations driven by climate change and human activities, few approaches have been proposed to explore changes in watershed resilience. The present study attempted to introduce a systematic approach that can be used to identify the resilience change of river basins based on annual river discharge through the application of a convex model and the principle of critical slowing down. Specifically, a resilience indicator (pi) that reflects streamflow autocorrelation at a given time was proposed to represent the temporal variation of the system resilience, and annual water discharge at representative hydrological stations located in upstream, midstream, and downstream regions of a river basin was used to reflect alterations in long-term hydrological processes and the stability of river basins. The application of this method to the Yellow River basin and Yangtze River basin indicated that the system resilience was lower in downstream regions compared to upstream regions. The Yellow River basin has suffered a decrease in resilience in its lower reaches since 1971, which extended to the middle reaches in 1987 and upper reaches in 1990. Similarly, recent observation of the resilience change in the Yangtze River basin indicated that resilience in its lower reaches has likely decreased since 2002, and this low resilience extended to the middle reaches in 2005. Overall, our study presents a new method to predict potential decreases of resilience in complex large scale watershed systems where mechanistic insight is insufficient to build reliable basin-scale hydrological, climate, ecosystem integrated models.},

With this aim, SeDeM expert system was developed as a useful preformulation tool to predict the likelihood to process drugs and excipients through direct compression. SeDeM system is a step forward in the rational development of a formulation, allowing the normalisation of the rheological parameters and the identification of the weaknesses and strengths of a powder or a powder blend. However, this method is based on the assumption of a linear behavior of disordered systems. As percolation theory has demonstrated, powder blends behave as non-linear systems that can suffer abrupt changes in their properties near to geometrical phase transitions of the components. The aim of this paper was to analyze for the first time the evolution of the SeDeM parameters in drug/excipient powder blends from the point of view of the percolation theory and to compare the changes predicted by SeDeM with the predictions of Percolation theory. For this purpose, powder blends of lactose and theophylline with varying concentrations of the model drug have been prepared and the SeDeM analysis has been applied to each blend in order to monitor the evolution of their properties. On the other hand, percolation thresholds have been estimated for these powder blends where critical points have been found for important rheological parameters as the powder flow. Finally, the predictions of percolation theory and SeDeM have been compared concluding that percolation theory can complement the SeDeM method for a more accurate estimation of the Design Space.},

The first step towards detection of social events is to track the appearance of multiple persons involved in them. In this paper, we propose a novel method to find correspondences of multiple faces in low temporal resolution egocentric videos acquired through a wearable camera. This kind of photo-stream imposes additional challenges to the multi-tracking problem with respect to conventional videos. Due to the free motion of the camera and to its low temporal resolution, abrupt changes in the field of view, in illumination condition and in the target location are highly frequent. To overcome such difficulties, we propose a multi-face tracking method that generates a set of tracklets through finding correspondences along the whole sequence for each detected face and takes advantage of the tracklets redundancy to deal with unreliable ones. Similar tracklets are grouped into the so called extended bag-of-tracklets (eBoT), which is aimed to correspond to a specific person. Finally, a prototype tracklet is extracted for each eBoT, where the occurred occlusions are estimated by relying on a new measure of confidence. We validated our approach over an extensive dataset of egocentric photo-streams and compared it to state of the art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.},

The performance of the PHD filter, however, is sensitive to the available knowledge on model parameters such as the measurement noise variance and those associated with the changes in the maneuvering target trajectories. If these parameters are unknown in advance, the tracking performance may degrade greatly. To address this aspect, this paper proposes to incorporate the adaptive parameter estimation (APE) method in the PHD filter so that the model parameters, which may be static and/or time-varying, can be estimated jointly with target states. The resulting APE-PHD algorithm is implemented using the particle filter (PF), which leads to the PF-APE-PHD filter. Simulations show that the newly proposed algorithm can correctly identify the unknown measurement noise variances, and it is capable of tracking multiple maneuvering targets with abrupt changing parameters in a more robust manner, compared to the multi-model approaches.},

Monthly precipitation extremes defined by maximum one-day precipitation amount (Rx1day) and maximum consecutive five-day precipitation amount (Rx5day) regimes were analyzed for precipitation data covering a period of 1957–2010. How the spatial patterns of these precipitation extremes are impacted by topographic characteristics was investigated using the max-stable method. Results indicated that a better performance of model can be identified if topographical influences were considered, showing the critical role of topography in the spatial distribution of precipitation extremes. Seasonal shifts of extreme precipitation events can be identified within the Poyang Lake basin: the Rx1day generally increases from the west to the east parts during spring, from the south to the north parts during summer, from the east to the west parts during autumn and from the northwest to the southeast parts during winter. Besides, details and subtle traits of spatial patterns of precipitation extremes can be attained when altitude was taken into consideration. However, complex influences of topographical properties or the mountains on changes of Rx1day and Rx5day were also detected: higher altitude tends to increase the Rx1day in summer and autumn while decrease the Rx1day in winter and spring, which should be attributed to propagation direction of water vapor flux and also different relations between water vapor flux and extreme precipitation processes during different seasons. When compared to Rx1day, the seasonal Rx5day regimes shift along the east–west direction and which may be attributed to the different seasonal movements of precipitation center for Rx5day when compared to those of Rx1day. Results of this study may help to better understand the possible influence of topography on the spatial patterns of precipitation extremes.},

	abstract = {Trend analysis is an efficient tool for process monitoring and diagnosis. However, the performances of a trend-based diagnosis system depend on the reliability of the trends extracted from the signals. One challenge in trend analysis is to design algorithms able to adapt themselves to the varying conditions of background noise and artefacts occurring non-deterministically on a same signal. Moreover, while long term trends such as decreasing/increasing have been extensively studied other subtle changes such as slow drifts and step-like transients have received little attention. In this paper, an adaptive on-line trend-extraction method is presented. It extends a former algorithm based on a linear segmentation to filter the signal and extract trends. In this version, the tuning parameters are not set to a fixed value for a given signal but can self-adapt on-line according to an estimation of the noise variance. An increasing or decreasing trend is detected if the variations on the signal are significantly higher than the level of the background noise. An initialisation phase is proposed to automatically set the initial values of the parameters, making the algorithm a self-tuned algorithm with minimal user intervention. The method was evaluated on a set of simulated data with various levels of background noise. It was also applied on real physiological data recorded from babies hospitalised in a Neonate Intensive Care Unit. It showed improved performances compared to the non adaptive algorithm, whatever the level of noise corrupting the data.},

Identified articles were manually reviewed. Results The top 100 news articles were from the following sources: local news outlet (50\%), national news outlet (24\%), nonimaging medical source (13\%), entertainment or culture news outlet (6\%), business news outlet (4\%), peer-reviewed journal (1\%), and radiology news outlet (1\%). Most common major themes were the screening mammography controversy (29\%), description of a new breast imaging technology (23\%), dense breasts (11\%), and promotion of a public screening initiative (11\%). For the most recent year, article stance toward screening mammography was 59\%, favorable; 16\%, unfavorable; and 25\%, neutral. After 2010, there was an abrupt shift in articles' stances from neutral to both favorable and unfavorable. Conclusions A wide range of online news sources addressed a range of issues related to mammography. National, rather than local, news sites were more likely to focus on the screening controversy and more likely to take an unfavorable view. The controversial United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines may have influenced articles to take a stance on screening mammography.

	abstract = {The existence of “spillover effects” in financial markets is well documented and multivariate time series techniques have been used to study the transmission of conditional variances among large and small market value firms. Earlier research has suggested that volatility surprises to large capitalization firms are a reliable predictor of the volatility of small capitalization firms. A related line of research has examined how regime shifts in volatility may account for a considerable amount of the persistence in volatility. However, these studies have focused on univariate modeling and many have imposed regime changes on a priori grounds. This paper re-examines the asymmetry in the predictability of the volatilities of large versus small market value firms allowing for sudden changes in variance. Our method of analysis extends the existing literature in two important ways. First, recent advances in time series econometrics allow us to detect the time periods of sudden changes in volatility of large cap and small cap stocks endogenously using the iterated cumulated sums of squares (ICSS) algorithm. Second, we directly incorporate the information obtained on sudden changes in volatility in a Bivariate GARCH model of small and large cap stock returns. Our findings indicate that accounting for volatility shifts considerably reduces the transmission in volatility and, in essence, removes the spillover effects. We conclude that ignoring regime changes may lead one to significantly overestimate the degree of volatility transmission that actually exists between the conditional variances of small and large firms.},

To extract damage-sensitive features, dimensional reduction techniques are applied and compared. An ensemble method of dimensional reduction feature outputs is presented and applied to two case studies. The results supports why ensembles can often perform better than any single-feature extraction method. For the first case study, aeroacoustic datasets are collected from controlled scaled experimental tests of controlled known damaged subscale wing structure. For the second case study, a vibration experiment study is used for abrupt change detection and tracking.

	abstract = {Purpose - The Saint Valentine's Decree (1984) and the ensuing hard-fought referendum (1985), which reduced the automatisms of scala mobile, started a process of redefinition of wage fixing in Italy, which culminated with the final abolition of scala mobile (1992) and the approval of Protocollo d'intesa (1993). Since then, following new corporatist principles, a national system of centralised wage bargaining (concertazione) and so-called “institutional indexation” have governed the determination of wages. Does incomes policy generate greater coordination in the process of wage formation? Does it cause greater co-movement of wages, prices, labour productivity and unemployment? This paper aims to answer these questions with reference to one of the G8 economies. Design/methodology/approach - After testing for unit root each component by using the ADF, Phillips and Perron, DF-GLS and Zivot and Andrews statistics, the paper tests for co-integration the so-called WPYE model using different methods. The Engle and Granger approach is used to assess the impact of incomes policy on the speed of adjustment of real wages, productivity (and unemployment) to their equilibrium value, while the Gregory and Hansen procedure serves as a means to endogenously detect the presence of a regime shift. The paper estimates coefficients before and after the structural break. Findings - Incomes policy based on the 1993 Protocol has caused a regime shift in the process of wage determination. The long-run estimates of the WPYE model do not generate stationary residuals except when a dummy for 1993 is added. The share of wages over GDP reduces by about ten percentage points in the early 1990s and has stood at about 57 per cent since 1995. The link with productivity is close to one-to-one only before the break. The feedback mechanism, as measured by the coefficient of lagged residuals in short-run estimates, is increased from -0.46 in the pre-reform to -0.79 in the post-reform period, suggesting that incomes policy has increased real wage flexibility indeed. In recent years the link between real wages and (very low) labour productivity growth has weakened. In a sense, incomes policy has introduced a new form of (upward) wage rigidity. Last bat not least, incomes policy has changed the correlation with the unemployment rate from positive to not statistically significant. Research limitations/implications - Future developments will focus on disentangling the impact of incomes policy vis-a-vis other policy interventions on WPYE and on unemployment. Practical implications - The analysis calls for a careful revision of the 1993 Protocol aimed at better protecting the purchasing power of real wages without losing control on inflation, and introducing growth-generating mechanisms. Originality/value - The paper studies the impact of incomes policy on WPYE and the Phillips curve by means of co-integration and structural break analysis. It proposes to interpret the effect of incomes policy on the Phillips curve as changing the coefficient of the error correction mechanism that leads real wages to their long-run equilibrium value.},

We report that climate change and overfishing are likely to be responsible for a rapid restructuring of a highly productive marine ecosystem with effects throughout the pelagos and the benthos. In the mid-1980s, climate change, consequent modifications in the North Sea plankton, and fishing, all reduced North Sea cod recruitment. In this region, production of many benthic species respond positively and immediately to temperature. Analysis of a long-term, spatially extensive biological (plankton and cod) and physical (sea surface temperature) dataset suggests that synchronous changes in cod numbers and sea temperature have established an extensive trophic cascade favoring lower trophic level groups over economic fisheries. A proliferation of jellyfish that we detect may signal the climax of these changes. This modified North Sea ecology may provide a clear indication of the synergistic consequences of coincident climate change and overfishing. The extent of the ecosystem restructuring that has occurred in the North Sea suggests we are unlikely to reverse current climate and human-induced effects through ecosystem resource management in the short term. Rather, we should understand and adapt to new ecological regimes. This implies that fisheries management policies will have to be fully integrated with the ecological consequences of climate change to prevent a similar collapse in an exploited marine ecosystem elsewhere.},

The fit of the models was rather poor, with about 30\%-40\% of the curves showing an adjusted R-square lower than 0.20 across all models. Results underline a great difficulty in modelling individual deviations around the mean curve for milk yield. However, the Ali and Schaeffer (5 parameter) model and the fourth-order Legendre polynomials were able to detect two basic shapes of individual deviations among the mean curve. Quadratic and, especially, cubic spline functions had better fitting performances but a poor predictive ability due to their great flexibility that results in an abrupt change of the estimated curve when data are missing. Parametric and orthogonal polynomials seem to be robust and affordable under this standpoint.},

Many of these accidents could be avoided by introducing ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) based on the detection of loss of tire/road friction. Friction (more specifically the maximum coefficient of friction) which is a parameter of tire/road interaction, mainly depends on the state of the road (dry, wet, snow, ice) and is closely related to the efforts at the tire level. In this paper, we propose, a new method for the estimation of the maximum tire/road friction coefficient, to automatically detect possible state of loss of friction which result in an abrupt change on the road state. This method is based on an iterative quadratic minimization of the error between the developed lateral force and the model of tire/road interaction. Results validate the application of the method.},

	abstract = {The detection problem in statistical signal processing can be succinctly formulated: given (possibly) signal bearing, n-dimensional signal-plus-noise snapshot vectors (samples) and statistically independent n-dimensional noise-only snapshot vectors, can one reliably infer the presence of a signal? This problem arises in the context of applications as diverse as radar, sonar, wireless communications, bioinformatics, and machine learning and is the critical first step in the subsequent signal parameter estimation phase. The signal detection problem can be naturally posed in terms of the sample generalized eigenvalues. The sample generalized eigenvalues correspond to the eigenvalues of the matrix formed by “whitening” the signal-plus-noise sample covariance matrix with the noise-only sample covariance matrix. In this paper, we prove a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample generalized eigenvalue-based detection of signals in arbitrarily colored noise when there are relatively few signal bearing and noise-only samples. Specifically, we show why when the (eigen) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is below a critical value, that is a simple function of,, and, then reliable signal detection, in an asymptotic sense, is not possible. If, however, the eigen-SNR is above this critical value then a simple, new random matrix theory-based algorithm, which we present here, will reliably detect the signal even at SNRs close to the critical value. Numerical simulations highlight the accuracy of our analytical prediction, permit us to extend our heuristic definition of the effective number of identifiable signals in colored noise and display the dramatic improvement in performance relative to the classical estimator by Zhao et al. We discuss implications of our result for the detection of weak and/or closely spaced signals in sensor array processing, abrupt change detection in sensor networks, and clustering methodologies in machine learning.},

The tools are a free-knot spline mean function estimation method and a Markov-switching vector autoregression model. 3. Our approach detected, with high probability, the occurrence of a regime shift in the zooplankton population in the early to mid-1990s. This was in-line with expectations based on similar events observed in the lake. 4. The suggested approach is a step forward from existing approaches in that it does not require any pre-determent of threshold values but rather relies on a hidden underlying stochastic process that yields probabilities of regime shifts. Thus, it can therefore be applied without introducing any prior biases into the analysis. The approach is, therefore, an objective method in detecting the likely occurrence of a regime shift.},

In addition, the average cycle time was used for validation of the results. Three transition velocities were identified that delineated the boundaries of the three main hydrodynamic regimes. The first two transition points were also confirmed by the information entropy concept.

Scale analysis is applied to identify the relevant forces leading to the CHF condition. Using these forces, a local parameter model is developed to predict the flow boiling CHF. The theoretical model is an extension of an earlier pool boiling CHF model and incorporates force balance among the evaporation momentum, surface tension, inertia, and viscous forces. Weber number, capillary number, and a new nondimensional group introduced earlier by Kandlikar (2004, “Heat Transfer Mechanisms During Flow Boiling in Microchannels,” ASME J. Heat Transfer, 126, pp. 8-16), K-2, representing the ratio of evaporation momentum to surface tension forces, emerged as main groups in quantifying the narrow channel effects on CHF. The constants in the model were calculated from the available experimental data. The mean error with ten data sets is 19.7\% with 76\% data falling within +/- 30\% error band and 93\% within +/- 50\% error band. The length to diameter ratio emerged as a parameter indicating a stepwise regime change. The success of the model indicates that flow boiling CHF can be modeled as a local phenomenon and the scale analysis is able to reveal important information regarding fundamental mechanisms leading to the CHF condition.

Coincident regime shifts were detected in phytoplankton, benthos, and fish in 1995, which was just after invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena spp.) became established in the bay in 1993-1994. Two independent methods were used to detect these shifts: 1) principal components analysis followed by a Regime Shift Detector test for a change point in the running mean of the first principal component scores and (2) measurements of significant difference between pre- and post-Dreissena ecosystem structure based on measures of Bray-Curtis community similarity. Although a statistically significant shift was not detected in the zooplankton community by itself, zooplankton variables were instrumental in the overall ecosystem shift, determined for the combined four communities. All 32 variables were ranked for their individual contribution to the difference between the pre- and post-Dreissena ecosystem structures. The resolution of two distinct ecosystem structures, pre- and post-Dreissena, was greatly improved after employing a novel method of variable optimization that involved a selective and sequential removal of variables contributing least to the statistical difference between pre- and post-Dreissena ecosystem structures. The resultant 20-variable subset defined a 1995 ecosystem regime shift at very high level of statistical confidence (ANOSIM-R=0.970). (C) 2010 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

For effective As/Ga ratios {\textless}1, in situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction measurements reveal clear NW growth delay due to formation of liquid Ga droplets since the growth proceeds via the vapor liquid solid mechanism. In contrast, for effective As/Ga ratios {\textgreater}1 an immediate onset of NW growth is observed indicating a transition to droplet-free, facet-driven selective area growth with low vertical growth rates. Distinctly different microstructures, facet formation and either the presence or absence of Ga droplets at the apex of NWs, are further elucidated by transmission electron microscopy.

First, we analyzed the monthly anomalies and looked for a relationship of such anomalies with total solar irradiance (TSI) and then the Regime Shift Detector (RSD) was applied to detect possible temperature regimes in the series. Afterwards, we calculated a yearly temperature range per pixel (amplitude of seasonal cycle) and through the subtraction of a latitudinal theoretical curve of temperature based on solar irradiance, the residuals of the seasonal cycle were obtained. The results showed an almost complete spatial synchrony and dominance of negative anomalies from 1950 to mid-late 1970's, with a switch to near-zero and positive anomalies that lasted up to late 1990's when a new shift to negative values was detected. Such a shift lasted until the early 2000's when positive anomalies appeared again but there was a change to negative anomalies in the late 2000's. These results were supported by the RSD. The TSI variability shows a clear relationship with that of sea surface temperature anomalies and with the regime changes. This is probably due to a difference in the amount of energy received from the sun. Comparing the “cool regime” versus the “warm regime”, the second one received 0.39\% more energy (approximately 3x10(8) Jm(-2)) from the sun. Seasonal cycles show larger ranges at northern latitudes ({\textgreater}40 degrees N), northern tropical-temperate transition zone (20 degrees-26 degrees N) and in the tropical-equatorial band (0 degrees-30 degrees S). The smallest ranges occur at 0 degrees-16 degrees N and 50 degrees-60 degrees S. The residuals (seasonal minus the theoretical curve) indicated a clear modulation due to advection by ocean currents.},

Our method detects events using adaptive thresholds that adapt to low-frequency variations in the baseline. After event identification, our method uses the CUSUM algorithm to fit the levels inside every event and automatically extracts their time and amplitude information. This facilitates the statistical analysis of an event population with a given number of levels. The obtained information improves the interpretation of interactions between the molecule and nanopore. Since our program does not require any prior information about the analyzed molecules, novel molecule-nanopore interactions can be characterized. In addition our program is very fast and stable.

High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) analysis shows that the particles have developed intragranular defects owing to gamma-ray irradiation. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and photoluminescence (PL) studies also support the formation of defect ordering upon irradiation. Further, PL study indicates abrupt change of the symmetry factor with increase in gamma-dose. By viewing the nature of variation between relative intensity of the defect-related emission and dose-dependent symmetry factor, one can predict the tunability of PL response. A proper understanding of the PL response of the irradiated nanoscale rare-earth oxides would find new avenues for lasing and other optoelectronic/photonic devices.},

During the crisis periods, financial markets are, in general, subject to an abrupt regime shift which imposes a significant challenge to option pricing models. In this context, swiftly evolving markets and institutions require valuation models that are capable of recognizing and adapting to such changes. Both parametric and non-parametric pricing models have shown poor forecast ability for options traded in late 1987 and 2008. Surprisingly, the pricing inaccuracy was more pronounced for non-parametric models than for parametric models. To address this problem, we propose a novel hybrid methodology modular neural network-fuzzy learning vector quantization (MNN-FLVQ) model - that uses the Kohonen unsupervised learning and fuzzy clustering algorithms to classify the S\&P 500 stock market index options, and thereby detect a regime shift. In our empirical application, the results for the 2008 financial crisis demonstrate that the MNN-FLVQ model is superior to the competing methods in regards to option pricing during regime shifts.},

In this way, the precision of the circuit model is improved. In addition, The Kalman gain matrix is optimized for EKF iterative algorithm by two ways: a constant gain is increased taking into account the entire process; a dynamic gain which increases at the beginning of abrupt change and decreases rapidly after abrupt change is set up. The improvement achieves a good tracing prediction.},

	abstract = {On the basis of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), a new method, moving cut data-DFA (MC-DFA), was presented to detect abrupt dynamic change in correlated time series. The numerical tests show the capability of the presented method to detect abrupt change time-instants in model time series generated by Logistic map. Moving DFA (MDFA) and approximate entropy (ApEn) can provide some information such as a single time-instant of abrupt dynamic change, but both of them cannot exactly detect all of the abrupt change regions. Some traditional methods, such as moving t-test, Cramer method, MannKendall test and Yamamoto method, even cannot provide any information of abrupt dynamic change in these model time series. Meanwhile, results showed that windows sizes and strong noise have some less effect on the MC-DFA results. In summary, MC-DFA provides a reliable measure to detect the abrupt dynamic change in correlated time series, and perfectively make up the deficiencies of MDFA and ApEn. The applications in daily surface air pressure records further verify the validity of the present method. Copyright (c) 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

	abstract = {Ecological regime shift is the rapid transition from one stable community structure to another, often ecologically inferior, stable community. Such regime shifts are especially common in shallow marine communities, such as the transition of kelp forests to algal turfs that harbour far lower biodiversity. Stable regimes in communities are a result of balanced interactions between species, and predicting new regimes therefore requires an evaluation of new species interactions, as well as the resilience of the `stable' position. While computational optimisation techniques can predict new potential regimes, predicting the most likely community state of the various options produced is currently educated guess work. In this study we integrate a stable regime optimisation approach with a Bayesian network used to infer prior knowledge of the likely stress of climate change (or, in practice, any other disturbance) on each component species of a representative rocky shore community model. Combining the results, by calculating the product of the match between resilient computational predictions and the posterior probabilities of the Bayesian network, gives a refined set of model predictors, and demonstrates the use of the process in determining community changes, as might occur through processes such as climate change. To inform Bayesian priors, we conduct a review of molecular approaches applied to the analysis of the transcriptome of rocky shore organisms, and show how such an approach could be linked to measureable stress variables in the field. Hence species-specific microarrays could be designed as biomarkers of in situ stress, and used to inform predictive modelling approaches such as those described here.},

Tests on model time series and 1000 simulated daily precipitation data show the ability of the present method to identify and detect abrupt change of probability density function. The applications of STP in daily precipitation data show that there is an abrupt climate change between 1979 and 1980 in the selected observational stations, which is almost the same with the result obtained by approximate entropy (ApEn). Furthermore, it is found that the sample sizes of sliding windows have some influence on the Lambda parameter of the Box-Cox transformation, but it does not significantly affect the varying trend of the parameter and the identification of the change point in annual or interannual time scale. Comparing STP with the coefficient of skewness and kurtosis, ApEn, and some statistics approaches (e.g. percentiles and annual maxima), we find that the performance of the present method is much better than that of these methods.},

However, in 2006 the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) adopted the new monetary policy framework through which short-term interest rates are adjusted to achieve stability in the value of the domestic currency. This paper has presented an empirical investigation into the demand for Nigerian real narrow money (M1) over the period 1960-2008 in an attempt to identify whether the CBN were right to adopt the new monetary policy framework. In doing so, we estimate alternative (canonical and extended) specifications of M1 demand using structural change methods. Our results suggest that the canonical specification is well-determined. Although the money demand relationship went through a regime shift in 1986, it is largely stable. These findings favour the use of supply of money as an instrument of monetary policy, thus lending limited support for the new monetary policy framework. (C) 2013 Society for Policy Modeling.

	abstract = {Squirrel-cage induction motors (IM) are the most popular motors used in industry, consuming around 85\% of the power in industrial plants. IM are critical components for most industries, and an early detection of induction motor faults has been a main subject of investigation during last years. Broken rotor bars in induction motors are among the major failures that are desirable to detect at early stages because this failure significantly increases power consumption and is responsible for further damage to the machinery. However, the detection of partially-broken rotor bars at an early stage is not so easily achieved. Therefore, it is necessary to use suitable condition monitoring accompanied with signal processing techniques to detect a partially-broken rotor bar. Thus, this paper focuses on a study and evaluation of a condition monitoring method based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition CEEMD of the stator current; aiming to detect partially broken, one, and two broken rotor bars in a line fed IM during the startup current transient. From the experimental results, the CEEMD is able to graphically show, in the time domain, the physical effect of the fault evolution during the startup current as an abrupt change in the envelope, and finally, these abrupt changes are quantified in a way that the level of fault can be identified correctly. Also, the CEEMD has the advantage of being an online diagnosis method, which does not require knowing a priori the motor current of the healthy condition.},

Specifically, a financial crisis accompanied by markedly increased volatility can be approached from this perspective to suggest the persistence or termination of a crisis. This paper develops the ICSS-CRISIS. algorithm, a new approach to identify a crisis period along with the conditions for the ICSS algorithm which represents the structural breakpoints of volatility. This algorithm recommends a guideline to determine whether an existing crisis in the market resulted from financial volatility, was terminated, or is continuing.

First, the two Binary Search Trees (BSTs), termed TcA and TcD, are constructed by multi-level HW from a diagnosed time series; the framework of HWKS method is implemented by introducing a modified KS statistic and two search rules based on the two BSTs; and then fast CP detection is implemented by two HWKS-based algorithms. Second, the performance of HWKS is evaluated by simulated time series dataset. The simulations show that HWKS is faster, more sensitive and efficient than KS, HW, and T methods.

The aim was to determine the original (magmatic) geochemical pattern of the crystal and the changes introduced by protomylonitization. Digital concentration-distribution models, derivative gradient models, and fractal statistics, e. g., Hurst-exponent values are used in a novel way to reveal subtle changes in the trace-element composition of the feldspar. Formation of the crystal is reflected in a slightly chaotic trace-element (Ba, Sr, and Rb) distribution pattern that is more or less characterized by continuous development from a fairly homogeneous environment. Derivative gradient models demonstrate a microdomain pattern. Fractal statistics show that element behavior was changeable, with Ba and Sr always more persistent (continuing) and Rb always less persistent, with the latter showing a tendency to migrate. The variations in the Hurst exponent are, however, too large to be explained by magmatic differentiation alone. The observed element behavior may be explained by structural changes revealed by Raman spectroscopy and CL. In high-strain domains, T-O-T modes become stronger for Si-O-Al than Al-O-Al linkages. Increasing amounts of Al-O–Al defects are demonstrated by cathodoluminescence. Both may result from small-distance diffusion creep, making the crystal geochemical pattern slightly patchy. In turn, the marginal part of the megacryst has a mosaic of randomly orientated, newly crystallized K-feldspars. The re-growth is confirmed by trace-element distribution patterns and fractal statistics which identify an abrupt change in the transformation environment. The novel set of tools used in this study reveals a complicated history of megacryst formation and transformation that otherwise would be difficult to unravel and decipher.},

The aim of this paper was to disentangle the effects of available area, mid-domain constraints, and the environmental tolerance of species, on the altitudinal distribution of tenebrionid beetles in a Mediterranean region. A comprehensive faunistic database was used to assess the elevational distribution of tenebrionids in Latium (Central Italy). Variations in species richness, beta diversity and nestedness were analysed in association with variation in species ranges and midpoints. Variation in species richness was contrasted with patterns expected on the basis of the mid domain effect (MDE) and available surface area. After correcting for differences in area availability due to the conical shape of mountains, an unexpected triphasic pattern emerged: (1) at low altitudes, species richness was higher than expected on the basis of the effect of area and the MDE; (2) at around 800 m elevation, there is an abrupt change in species assemblages, and richness values fit those predicted by the MDE; (3) a new dramatic change occurred at 1,700 m, with tenebrionid assemblages composed of a small number of mainly eurytopic species. The integrated approach used in this study demonstrates that neither MDE nor monotonic patterns fully explain the observed diversity patterns. Variations in species ranges indicate that the elevational gradient filters species according to their ecological tolerance.},

	abstract = {Extreme climatic events can trigger abrupt and often lasting change in ecosystems via the reduction or elimination of foundation (i.e., habitat-forming) species. However, while the frequency/intensity of extreme events is predicted to increase under climate change, the impact of these events on many foundation species and the ecosystems they support remains poorly understood. Here, we use the iconic seagrass meadows of Shark Bay, Western Australia - a relatively pristine subtropical embayment whose dominant, canopy-forming seagrass, Amphibolis antarctica, is a temperate species growing near its low-latitude range limit - as a model system to investigate the impacts of extreme temperatures on ecosystems supported by thermally sensitive foundation species in a changing climate. Following an unprecedented marine heat wave in late summer 2010/11, A. antarctica experienced catastrophic ({\textgreater}90\%) dieback in several regions of Shark Bay. Animal-borne video footage taken from the perspective of resident, seagrass-associated megafauna (sea turtles) revealed severe habitat degradation after the event compared with a decade earlier. This reduction in habitat quality corresponded with a decline in the health status of largely herbivorous green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in the 2years following the heat wave, providing evidence of long-term, community-level impacts of the event. Based on these findings, and similar examples from diverse ecosystems, we argue that a generalized framework for assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems to abrupt change associated with the loss of foundation species is needed to accurately predict ecosystem trajectories in a changing climate. This includes seagrass meadows, which have received relatively little attention in this context. Novel research and monitoring methods, such as the analysis of habitat and environmental data from animal-borne video and data-logging systems, can make an important contribution to this framework.},

Two payments for watershed services (PWS) programs for water quality improvement have been successively implemented in the Huai River catchment and its sub-watershed, the Shaying River catchment, in Henan Province since 2009. To detect changes in water quality in response to PWS schemes, nonparametric statistical approaches were used to analyze gradual and abrupt trends in water quality, focusing on chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) at 26 monitoring stations in the Huai River watershed during 2006-2013. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test and the Theil-Sen estimator were used to identify trends and their magnitudes in weekly water quality observations and the Pettitt test was applied to change-point analysis of water quality time series. We found decreasing concentration trends in the weekly water quality data set in this catchment, with water quality at most stations affected by the PWS schemes. The COD and NH3-N concentrations decreased at 26 stations by an average of 0.05 mg/L wk and 0.01 mg/L wk, respectively, from 2006 to 2013. Meanwhile, the mean concentrations of COD and NH3-N decreased at the 26 stations by an average of 1803 mg/L and 4.82 mg/L, respectively, after the abrupt change points of the time-series trends of these two pollutants. We also estimated annual reductions in COD and NH3-N for each station based on average flow observations using the Theil-Sen approach along with the resulting economic benefits from 2009 to 2010. The COD and NH3-N reductions were 14604.50 and 6213.25 t/y, respectively, in the Huai River catchment in Henan Province. The total economic benefits of reductions in these two pollutants were 769.71 million (sic) 2009 and 2010, accounting for 0.08\% and 0.06\%, respectively, of the GDP in the entire Huai River watershed of Henan Province. These results provide new insights into the linkages between PWS programs and water quality improvements at regional and local scales for effective management of water resources.

	abstract = {Around the world, the decreasing health of coral reef ecosystems has highlighted the need to better understand the processes of reef degradation. The development of more sensitive tools, which complement traditional methods of monitoring coral reefs, may reveal earlier signs of degradation and provide an opportunity for pre-emptive responses. We identify new, sensitive metrics of ecosystem processes and benthic composition that allow us to quantify subtle, yet destabilizing, changes in the ecosystem state of an inshore coral reef on the Great Barrier Reef. Following severe climatic disturbances over the period 2011-2012, the herbivorous reef fish community of the reef did not change in terms of biomass or functional groups present. However, fish-based ecosystem processes showed marked changes, with grazing by herbivorous fishes declining by over 90\%. On the benthos, algal turf lengths in the epilithic algal matrix increased more than 50\% while benthic sediment loads increased 37-fold. The profound changes in processes, despite no visible change in ecosystem state, i.e., no shift to macroalgal dominance, suggest that although the reef has not undergone a visible regime-shift, the ecosystem is highly unstable, and may sit on an ecological knife-edge. Sensitive, process-based metrics of ecosystem state, such as grazing or browsing rates thus appear to be effective in detecting subtle signs of degradation and may be critical in identifying ecosystems at risk for the future.},

	abstract = {Spectro-Temporal Receptive Fields (STRFs) were estimated from both multi-unit sorted clusters and high-gamma power responses in human auditory cortex. Intracranial electrophysiological recordings were used to measure responses to a random chord sequence of Gammatone stimuli. Traditional methods for estimating STRFs from single-unit recordings, such as spike-triggered-averages, tend to be noisy and are less robust to other response signals such as local field potentials. We present an extension to recently advanced methods for estimating STRFs from generalized linear models (GLM). A new variant of regression using regularization that penalizes non-zero coefficients is described, which results in a sparse solution. The frequency-time structure of the STRF tends toward grouping in different areas of frequency-time and we demonstrate that group sparsity-inducing penalties applied to GLM estimates of STRFs reduces the background noise while preserving the complex internal structure. The contribution of local spiking activity to the high-gamma power signal was factored out of the STRF using the GLM method, and this contribution was significant in 85 percent of the cases. Although the GLM methods have been used to estimate STRFs in animals, this study examines the detailed structure directly from auditory cortex in the awake human brain. We used this approach to identify an abrupt change in the best frequency of estimated STRFs along posteromedial-to-anterolateral recording locations along the long axis of Heschl's gyrus. This change correlates well with a proposed transition from core to non-core auditory fields previously identified using the temporal response properties of Heschl's gyrus recordings elicited by click-train stimuli.},

	abstract = {Traditional mathematical models of epidemic disease had for decades conventionally considered static structure for contacts. Recently, an upsurge of theoretical inquiry has strived towards rendering the models more realistic by incorporating the temporal aspects of networks of contacts, societal and online, that are of interest in the study of epidemics (and other similar diffusion processes). However, temporal dynamics have predominantly focused on link fluctuations and nodal activities, and less attention has been paid to the growth of the underlying network. Many real networks grow: Online networks are evidently in constant growth, and societal networks can grow due to migration flux and reproduction. The effect of network growth on the epidemic properties of networks is hitherto unknown, mainly due to the predominant focus of the network growth literature on the so-called steady state. This paper takes a step towards alleviating this gap. We analytically study the degree dynamics of a given arbitrary network that is subject to growth. We use the theoretical findings to predict the epidemic properties of the network as a function of time. We observe that the introduction of new individuals into the network can enhance or diminish its resilience against endemic outbreaks and investigate how this regime shift depends upon the connectivity of newcomers and on how they establish connections to existing nodes. Throughout, theoretical findings are corroborated with Monte Carlo simulations over synthetic and real networks. The results shed light on the effects of network growth on the future epidemic properties of networks and offers insights for devising a priori immunization strategies.},

The major advantage of this approach over the conventional CMM is that a corner with only one sensed edge can be identified through comparing the scan data between two subsequent sensed points in the same scan, as a sharp corner with only one edge sensed will cause two adjacent scan data an abrupt change. In order to identify the same corner point in two adjacent scans, an effective corner matching algorithm is formulated based on the distance matrix constructed from the corner points identified in each scan. Finally, with two or more matched corner points between two adjacent scans, the change of the robot pose (position and orientation) can be accurately estimated. As the proposed approach only deals with the point data, it is computationally efficient. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through experiments.},

We address this challenge with a new analytic approach to detect and assess the relative strength of different driving processes in food webs. Our study draws on complexity theory, and integrates the network-centric exponential random graph modelling (ERGM) framework developed within the social sciences with community ecology. In contrast to previous research, this approach makes dear assumptions of direction of causality and accommodates a dynamic perspective on the emergence of food webs. We apply our approach to analysing food webs of the Baltic Sea before and after a previously reported regime shift. Our results show that the dominant food web processes have remained largely the same, although we detect changes in their magnitudes. The results indicate that the reported regime shift may not be a system-wide shift, but instead involve a limited number of species. Our study emphasizes the importance of community-wide analysis on marine regime shifts and introduces a novel approach to examine food webs.},

In this paper, a novel fall detection system focusing mainly on dusky environments is proposed. In dusky environments, the silhouette images of human bodies extracted from conventional CCD cameras are usually imperfect due to the abrupt change of illumination. Thus, our work adopts a thermal imager to detect human bodies. The proposed approach adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy. Firstly, the downward optical flow features are extracted from the thermal images to identify fall-like actions in the coarse stage. The horizontal projection of motion history images (MHI) extracted from fall-like actions are then designed to verify the incident by the proposed nearest neighbor feature line embedding (NNFLE) in the fine stage. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can distinguish the fall incidents with high accuracy even in dusky environments and overlapping situations.},

	abstract = {Internal surface damage such as wall-thinning and cracks in piping systems are mainly caused by chemical reactions, heat, erosion, solid carrying fluids or a combination of such influences. Early detection of such surface damage is crucial in order to avoid sudden failure and the subsequent downtime losses and safety hazards. In this paper we develop methods for inner damage identification in pipes utilizing the vibration mode shapes. Wall-thinning and cracks are modeled by smooth gradual change and abrupt change in the internal surface of the pipe, respectively. Since wavelets are very efficient in detecting fast changes in signals and their derivatives, they are primarily used to detect crack development. While wavelets cannot be used to detect smooth wall-thinning changes, they can, nevertheless, be used to detect the beginning and end of such damage. We develop a new method for identifying the profile of the inner surface of the pipe, once the wavelet transform indicates that damage is taking place. The identification process requires the shape of one vibration mode of the pipe and does not require the elaborate monitoring and tracking of changes in the modal characteristics. No baseline data are needed aside from the nominal values of the pipe parameters. In addition to damage localization, the developed identification method is capable of quantizing damage severity from the identification of a more accurate profile of the inner surface of the pipe. The motivation and methods used in this work are introduced first in a general setting and then demonstrated by several pipe examples. The numerical simulations carried out here indicate the effectiveness of the developed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Natural hydrological regimes are essential to the stability of river basins. While numerous efforts have been put forth to characterize flow regime alterations driven by climate change and human activities, few approaches have been proposed to explore changes in watershed resilience. The present study attempted to introduce a systematic approach that can be used to identify the resilience change of river basins based on annual river discharge through the application of a convex model and the principle of critical slowing down. Specifically, a resilience indicator (p(1)) that reflects streamfiow autocorrelation at a given time was proposed to represent the temporal variation of the system resilience, and annual water discharge at representative hydrological stations located in upstream, midstream, and downstream regions of a river basin was used to reflect alterations in long-term hydrological processes and the stability of river basins. The application of this method to the Yellow River basin and Yangtze River basin indicated that the system resilience was lower in downstream regions compared to upstream regions. The Yellow River basin has suffered a decrease in resilience in its lower reaches since 1971, which extended to the middle reaches in 1987 and upper reaches in 1990. Similarly, recent observation of the resilience change in the Yangtze River basin indicated that resilience in its lower reaches has likely decreased since 2002, and this low resilience extended to the middle reaches in 2005. Overall, our study presents a new method to predict potential decreases of resilience in complex large scale watershed systems where mechanistic insight is insufficient to build reliable basin-scale hydrological, climate, ecosystem integrated models.

	abstract = {Polar bear (Ursus maritimus) subpopulations in several areas with seasonal sea ice regimes have shown declines in body condition, reproductive rates, or abundance as a result of declining sea ice habitat. In the Foxe Basin region of Nunavut, Canada, the size of the polar bear subpopulation has remained largely stable over the past 20 years, despite concurrent declines in sea ice habitat. We used fatty acid analysis to examine polar bear feeding habits in Foxe Basin and thus potentially identify ecological factors contributing to population stability. Adipose tissue samples were collected from 103 polar bears harvested during 2010-2012. Polar bear diet composition varied spatially within the region with ringed seal (Pusa hispida) comprising the primary prey in northern and southern Foxe Basin, whereas polar bears in Hudson Strait consumed equal proportions of ringed seal and harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus). Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) consumption was highest in northern Foxe Basin, a trend driven by the ability of adult male bears to capture large-bodied prey. Importantly, bow-head whale (Balaena mysticetus) contributed to polar bear diets in all areas and all age and sex classes. Bowhead carcasses resulting from killer whale (Orcinus orca) predation and subsistence harvest potentially provide an important supplementary food source for polar bears during the ice-free period. Our results suggest that the increasing abundance of killer whales and bowhead whales in the region could be indirectly contributing to improved polar bear foraging success despite declining sea ice habitat. However, this indirect interaction between top predators may be temporary if continued sea ice declines eventually severely limit on-ice feeding opportunities for polar bears.},

The method is based on a nonlinear least squares estimation that yields predictions of when the bubble will change regime. Previous studies have only presented results where the predictions turn out to be successful. This study is the first to highlight both the potential and the limitations of the LPPL-model. We find evidence that supports the characteristic patterns as proposed by the LPPL-framework leading up to the change in regime; asset prices during bubble periods seem to oscillate around a faster-than-exponential growth. In most cases the estimation yields accurate predictions, although we conclude that the predictions are quite dependent on the point in time at which they are conducted. We also find that the end of a speculative bubble seems to be influenced by both endogenous speculative growth and exogenous factors. For this reason we propose a new way of interpreting the predictions of the model, where the end dates should be interpreted as the start of a time period where the asset prices are especially sensitive to exogenous events. We propose that negative news during this time period results in a regime shift and the bursting of the bubble. Thus, the model has the ability to predict sensitivity to exogenous events},

	abstract = {The human population is projected to grow to more than 9 billion by 2050. New farming and fishing techniques are continually being developed. However, food production remains restricted by the finiteness of natural resources and the rapid increase in the global population. In the future, food production may decline because of the aggravated effects of climate change. Food production will be unable to satisfy the demands of the global population, leading to a food security crisis. As the world population continues to increase, food shortages will become increasingly severe, particularly for regions located in “climate impact hot spots” in tropical and subtropical zones and for small-island countries such as Taiwan. In the present study, supply and demand are analysed to examine the risks and uncertainties associated with the impact of climate change on the domestic and imported seafood supply. First, we conduct a literature review to identify the climate risk for sea food security, and then, we analyse the domestic production of both the marine fishing catch and aquaculture. This study also examines the critical problems of the imported seafood supply and applies a comparative analysis of impact type and differences in the top 10 seafood import countries to organize adaptation strategies to climate change. Moreover, due to the type of climate impact and the differences between long-term climate impact and extreme climate impact, we collect and compile the existing climate adaptation strategies of fishery production, seafood importing, and the demand and supply of seafood in Taiwan. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis to seek any deficiencies in the existing climate adaptation strategies and offer new adaptation guidelines based on the existing climate adaptation strategies. The results show that Taiwan's major adaptation strategies have been precautionary mitigation measures. In terms of resilience management, only the buffer stock scheme plan and the stabilization funds method are selected for some specific species to mitigate the short-term fluctuation in both yield and price for imported domestic seafood. However, we will confront uncertainties stemming from global climate change in the future; the existing climate adaptation strategies of Taiwan are still not sufficient to respond to climate impacts. For example, the climate change early warning system is still very inadequate, the existing scientific knowledge is insufficient, and the current adaptation strategies are insufficient for resolving the fluctuations in the market mechanism of seafood. According to the principles of risk management, the adaptation strategies recommended in this study can be differentiated into two categories: precautionary mitigation measures can be used to adapt to domestic production and uncertainties; such measures include avoidance, transfer, and reduction to prevent the frequency and consequences of climate change for building a resilient fisheries sector. Moreover, resilience management (e.g., risk retention) can be used to respond to uncertainties in supply for adjusting production and mitigating the risks of climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on this, two-dimensional detrended fluctuation analysis (TD-DFA) is used to estimate the Hurst exponent of two-dimensional images. Then, we monitored the change of the Hurst exponent of the images to identify an abrupt dynamic change. We tested the performance of this method with a coupled spatiotemporal dynamic model and found that it works well. The changes in the Hurst exponents of the spatial images are stable when there is no dynamic change in the system, but there will be a clear non-stationary change of the Hurst exponents; for example, the abrupt mean values change if the dynamics of the system change. Thus, the TD-DFA method is suitable for detecting an abrupt dynamic change from natural and artificial images. The spatial images of the NCEP reanalysis of the daily average temperature exhibited fractality. Based on this, we found three non-stationary changes in the Hurst exponents for the NCEP reanalysis of the daily average temperature or for the annual average temperature in the region (60A degrees S-60A degrees N). It can be concluded that the climate system may have incurred three dynamic changes since 1961 on decadal timescales, i.e., in approximately the mid-1970s, the mid-1980s, and between the late 1990s and the early 2000s.},

	abstract = {Ecological shifts in shallow lakes from clear-water macrophyte-dominated to turbid-water phytoplankton-dominated are generally thought of as rapid short-term transitions. Diatom remains in sediment records from shallow lakes in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America provide new evidence that the long-term ecological stability of these lakes is defined by the legacy of large regime shifts. We examine the modern and historical stability of 11 shallow lakes. Currently, four of the lakes are in a clear-water state, three are consistently turbid-water, and four have been observed to change state from year to year (transitional). Lake sediment records spanning the past 150-200 yr suggest that (1) the diatom assemblage is characteristic of either clear or turbid lakes, (2) prior to significant landscape alteration, all of the lakes existed in a regime of a stable clear-water state, (3) lakes that are currently classified as turbid or transitional have experienced one strong regime shift over the past 150-200 yr and have since remained in a regime where turbid-water predominates, and (4) top-down impacts to the lake food-web from fish introductions appear to be the dominant driver of strong regime shifts and not increased nutrient availability. Based on our findings we demonstrate a method that could be used by lake managers to identify lakes that have an ecological history close to the clear-turbid regime threshold; such lakes might more easily be returned to a clear-water state through biomanipulation. The unfortunate reality is that many of these lakes are now part of a managed landscape and will likely require continued intervention.},

With IMS networks widespread deployment, SIP flooding attacks are becoming into a major threat to IMS network. However, the existing SIP flooding attack detection schemes are inefficient for detecting low rate SIP flooding attacks and are lacking in poor recovery for detecting high-rate SIP flooding attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel SIP flooding attack detection scheme with the internal and external detection features in IMS networks, called SFADS (SIP flooding attack detection scheme). In SFADS, based on the analysis of SIP flooding attacks, we first extract the abrupt change of SIP session request as the external detection feature, and the abnormal abrupt change of difference between the sequence of legitimate SIP session establishment and the SIP session request messages as the internal detection feature. Then we use the improved cumulative sum control chart algorithm to analyze the two detection features. Finally, we take the analysis data as inputs and adopt Fuzzy Logic to detect SIP flooding attacks. To investigate the detection performance of the proposed SFADS, we conduct simulations with the prototype implement in an IMS network testbed. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed SFADS is better than that of other schemes.},

We set up the problem as a stochastic optimization in which the objective is to minimize a measure of detection delay subject to a constraint on frequency of false alarms. We design a novel composite stopping rule and prove that it is asymptotically optimal of third order under a weighted Lorden's criterion for detection delay. We also develop the strategy to identify the post-change drift and analyze the conditional identification error asymptotically. Our composite rules are based on CUSUM stopping times, as well as their reaction periods, namely the times between the last reset of the CUSUM statistic process and the CUSUM alarm. The established results shed new light on the performance of CUSUM strategies under model uncertainty and offer strong asymptotic optimality results in this framework.},

The predicted impedance samples are obtained using the Kalman filter and Taylor expansion, which are used in this paper to track the phasor precisely. Second order of Taylor expansion is used to decrease the corrugation effect of impedance estimation and increase the reliability of the proposed method. Furthermore, in order to increase the selectivity of the proposed method, the proposed index is armed with phase comparison logic to detect internal faults. The instantaneous estimation and prediction capability of the Kalman filter are two reasons for proposing the use of Kalman filter.

Tree-ring reconstructions of forest disturbance can inform restoration and management plans by placing these changes into a historical context. This study examined forest disturbance with regard to land use change and drought in the New River Gorge region of West Virginia. I developed a 182-year pitch pine (Pinus rigida) growth chronology (1833-2014) using samples collected from 33 trees along 2 km of south-and southwest-facing slopes at Babcock State Park. Samples cut from fire-scarred pitch and Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana) were used to generate a fire chronology for the site. Temporal trends in pitch pine growth variability were assessed using regime shift and growth release detection methods. There was no change in pitch pine growth during the transition from the early settlement to industrial era (ca. 1885), while a significant decrease in annual growth variability characterized the post-industrial era (1963-2014). Seventeen fire events were recorded between 1887 and 1968. Growth releases displayed a temporal relationship with fire and there was a strong, but not significant, association between drought and fire years. These results suggest a coupled system in which anthropogenic fires driven by periodic drought maintained pitch pine before and during industrialization. Reintroducing fire to the post-industrial forest may not meet management objectives as decades of fire exclusion have altered forest fuels and species composition such that its effects would be difficult to predict.},

The present paper contributes to this aspect in that collision detections can be completed on the servo level in an intuitive way. The principle of the proposed collision detection strategy is based on the relative difference of the feedback commanded torque, which is able to identify the abrupt change in the feedback commanded torque's slope during collisions. Under the assumptions that the planned motion is smooth enough and that the gravity with respect to the joint variable is continuous, the detection strategy presented here can work fast and efficiently. A prototype with one degree of freedom (DOF) has been built to verify the given approach. Experiment results reveal that the proposed method is valid in different situations. In addition, since no external force/torque sensors (F/T sensors) are needed in this process, the proposed method is also economical.},

	doi = {10.3390/rs9040352},
	abstract = {The response of an ecosystem to external drivers may not always be gradual and reversible. Discontinuous and sometimes irreversible changes, called `regime shifts' or `Critical transitions', can occur. The likelihood of such shifts is expected to increase for a variety of ecosystems, and it is difficult to predict how close an ecosystem is to a critical transition. Recent modelling studies identified indicators of impending regime shifts that can be used to provide early warning signals of a critical transition. The identification of such transitions crucially depends on the ability to monitor key ecosystem variables, and their success may be limited by lack of appropriate data. Moreover, empirical demonstrations of the actual functioning of these indicators in real-world ecosystems are rare. This paper presents the first study which uses remote sensing data to identify a critical transition in a wetland ecosystem. In this study, we argue that a time series of remote sensing data can help to characterize and determine the timing of a critical transition. This can enhance our abilities to detect and anticipate them. We explored the potentials of remotely sensed vegetation (NDVI), water (MNDWI), and vegetation- water (VWR) indices, obtained from time series of MODIS satellite images to characterize the stability of a wetland ecosystem, Dorge Sangi, near the lake Urmia, Iran, that experienced a regime shift recently. In addition, as a control case, we applied the same methods to another wetland ecosystem in Lake Arpi, Armenia which did not experience a regime shift. We propose a new composite index (MVWR) based on combining vegetation and water indices, which can improve the ability to anticipate a critical transition in a wetland ecosystem. Our results revealed that MVWR in combination with autocorrelation at-lag-1 could successfully provide early warning signals for a critical transition in a wetland ecosystem, and showed a significantly improved performance compared to either vegetation (NDVI) or water (MNDWI) indices alone.},

	abstract = {The scaling exponent is an effective nonlinear dynamic index, which can be used to detect the dynamic structure mutations of the correlation time series by the moving cut a fixed window technology. The immediacy and accuracy of scaling exponent is very important for detecting the series change points, however, some of the existing scale index calculation methods (such as rescaled range analysis and rescaled variance analysis) take none of these into account. Wavelet transform analysis can quickly decompose the sequence on different scales, and then the scaling index can be calculated by analyzing the scaling relation of wavelet coefficients on different scales, which has the characteristics of fast calculation speed and good convergence and memory saving. By moving cut window technology, in the present paper we put forward a new method, i.e., the moving cut data-wavelet transformation for detecting a series of dynamic structure mutations. The principle is that the removal of the data has little effect on the estimation of the scaling exponents of the correlation time series with the same dynamical properties. In order to test the performance of the method, first of all, the dynamic structure mutation analyses of linear ideal time series and nonlinear ideal time series are carried out by selecting different moving cut fixed windows. The test results show that the method can quickly and accurately detect the dynamic structure change points and intervals both in linear time series and nonlinear time series, besides, its calculation speed is obviously better than the moving cut data-rescaled range analysis and the moving cut data-rescaled variance analysis. It has strong stability, and depends less on the moving cut window length, which will have some advantages in the large data processing. At the same time, in order to detect the influence of noise on the method, the linear and nonlinear ideal time series are added to the white Gaussian noise (S N R = 2 0, 25, 30 dB), respectively, and the results show that the method has a strong anti-noise ability with different moving cut window lengths, can still quickly and accurately detect the mutation point or interval in different noise additions. Finally, the method is used to detect the dynamic structure mutation of measured daily maximum temperature data of Foping station in Wei basin, the experimental results indicate that the mutation interval is consistent with the abrupt change in 1970's on a global scale, which further verifies the validity of the method.},

This study proposes a novel procedure based on discrete wavelet transform and principal component analysis for detecting organic contamination events from ultraviolet spectral data. Firstly, the spectrum of each observation is transformed using discrete wavelet with a coiflet mother wavelet to capture the abrupt change along the wavelength. Principal component analysis is then employed to approximate the spectra based on capture and fusion features. The significant value of Hotelling's T-2 statistics is calculated and used to detect outliers. An alarm of contamination event is triggered by sequential Bayesian analysis when the outliers appear continuously in several observations. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is tested on-line using a pilot-scale setup and experimental data.},

Whilst the significance of these discontinuities to the overall development of the mountain belt is still being investigated, their identification and characterization has become important for potential correlations across regions, and for constraining the kinematic framework of the mid-crust. The result of new phase equilibria modelling, trace element analysis and high-precision Lu-Hf garnet dating of the metapelites from the Likhu Khola region in east central Nepal, combined with the previously published monazite petrochronology data confirms the presence of one of such cryptic thrust-sense tectonometamorphic discontinuities within the lower portion of the exhumed metamorphic core and provides new constraints on the P-T estimates for that region. The location of the discontinuity is marked by an abrupt change in the nature of P-T-t paths of the rocks across it. The rocks in the footwall are characterized by a prograde burial P-T path with peak metamorphic conditions of similar to 660 degrees C and similar to 9.5kbar likely in the mid-to-late Miocene, which are overlain by the hanging wall rocks, that preserve retrograde P-T paths with P-T conditions of {\textgreater}700 degrees C and similar to 7kbar in the early Miocene. The occurrence of this thrust-sense structure that separates rock units with unique metamorphic histories is compatible with orogenic models that identify a spatial and temporal transition from early midcrustal deformation and metamorphism in the deeper hinterland to later deformation and metamorphism towards the shallower foreland of the orogen. Moreover, these observations are comparable with those made across other discontinuities at similar structural levels along the Himalaya, confirming their importance as important orogen-scale structures.},

	abstract = {Many abrupt climate change events often cannot be detected timely by conventional abrupt detection methods until a few years after these events have occurred. The reason for this lag in detection is that abundant and long-term observational data are required for accurate abrupt change detection by these methods, especially for the detection of a regime shift. So, these methods cannot help us understand and forecast the evolution of the climate system in a timely manner. Obviously, spatial images, generated by a coupled spatiotemporal dynamical model, contain more information about a dynamic system than a single time series, and we find that spatial images show the fractal properties. The fractal properties of spatial images can be quantitatively characterized by the Hurst exponent, which can be estimated by two-dimensional detrended fluctuation analysis (TD-DFA). Based on this, TD-DFA is used to detect an abrupt dynamic change of a coupled spatiotemporal model. The results show that the TD-DFA method can effectively detect abrupt parameter changes in the coupled model by monitoring the changing in the fractal properties of spatial images. The present method provides a new way for abrupt dynamic change detection, which can achieve timely and efficient abrupt change detection results.},

Most of them have assumed that changes in dynamic social networks occur gradually. This presumption for the dynamic social network in which abrupt changes may occur misleads the problem. Few methods have tried to detect abrupt changes, but they used the statistical approach which has such disadvantages as the need for a lot of snapshots. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect the type of changes using the least information of social networks and then, apply it to a new community detection framework named change-aware model.

Dobutamine (1 nmol/l to 10 μmol/l) was superfused in 10 oxygenated preparations to select the optimal drug concentration to be used in another 22 which were randomized. Group (A) consisted of time-related controls (Tyrodes's solution for 225 min at cycle length (CL) 1600 ms and no dobutamine). There were two test groups, respectively: (B) low (1600 ms CL) and (C) high (400 ms CL) stimulation rate. After 60 min of stabilization, in groups B and C, hypoxic superfusion (O2 content 5 ml/l) lasted 60 min, then reoxygenation (60 min) and dobutamine challenge (1 μmol/l, 15 min) were performed. Analysis of variance for repeated measures with the Greenhouse–Geisser correction, and a repeated measures model with structured covariance (preparation mass, length, width and time-varying time to peak tension) matrices were used whereby grouping (G), time (T) and G·T interaction were weighted. Force–frequency relationship and post-pausal potentiation were studied after each phase. Electrophysiology, histomorphometry and electron microscopy were carried out (n=6). Felodipine (0.1 μmol/l, n=5) pretreatment (15 min before hypoxia) was given in parallel experiments. Results: Time-related controls showed =̃ 10\% per hour decrease of developed tension and the Paradise test provided ≅80\% of control values. In test groups (as compared to baseline values) contractility was decreased ≅65\% after hypoxia–reoxygenation and it increased ≅25\% after dobutamine (G, 0.0155{\textless}P{\textless}0.0065; T, P=0.00005; G·T, P=0.00005). High stimulation rate during hypoxia worsened hypoxia–reoxygenation contractile changes, whereas reversibility after dobutamine was less. In both B and C groups during hypoxia, contractility decreased quite rapidly, although by 10 min or so a plateau (≅50\%) was reached in group B, whereas in group C contractility decreased to {\textless}20\%. None of the covariates contributed significantly to predict the dependent variables investigated. Force–frequency relationship and post-pausal potentiation were repeatable, paralleled overall changes due to hypoxia, reoxygenation and dobutamine challenge and were useful to discriminate Ca2+-related diastolic processes thus helping index myocardial contractile reserve. Force–frequency relationship was negative at high stimulation rates, concomitant to an abrupt change of shape and duration of action potential with little time for Ca2+-related Ca2+ release and ensuing systolic processes. Felodipine pretreatment enabled an unblunted response to dobutamine. Histomorphometry showed an unexpected `fibrotic core'. At electron microscopy, subendocardial and deep part of the same pectinate muscles showed identical degrees of degenerative lesions. Superfused samples showed, unexpectedly, less anoxic lesions than preparations fixed within 15 min from surgical explant, although lesions were higher than in samples fixed immediately after explant. Conclusions: This might be a relevant model, whereby pharmacological or physical interventions are tested. Native human atrial trabeculae might be used without dissection and/or preservatives. If high stimulation rate during hypoxia is used the power of hypothesis testing is maximized. Future studies with this material will be easier and comparatively smaller series might be investigated. Felodipine at low concentration was protective in this model.},

For all but one composition, the measured self diffusion coefficients decrease in the order DCa {\textgreater} D Al {\textgreater} D O {\textgreater} D Si, with D Ca ∼ 4–19 D Si , D Al ∼ 2D Si, and D O ∼ 1–2 D Si. The relative uncertainties, based on replicated experiments, are 8\% for DCa, 27\% for DAl, 28\% for DSi, and 18\% for DO. Although the self diffusion coefficients of calcium, aluminum, silicon, and oxygen increase with the decrease of melt viscosity, they do not obey the Stokes-Einstein equation or the Eyring equation. The compositional dependence of the self diffusion coefficients of calcium, aluminum, and oxygen were parameterized in terms of melt viscosity (Pa · s) via the power law relation: DCa = (115.141/viscosity 0.389) × 10 −12m 2s −1DA1 = (47.302/viscosity 0.800) × 10 −12m 2s −1DO = (33.080/viscosity 0.722) × 10 −12m 2s −1 The compositional dependence of the self diffusion coefficients of Si was parameterized in terms of the degree of melt polymerization (NBO/T) DSi = [0.669 exp(4.195 NBO/T)] × 10 −12m 2s −1 There is an abrupt change in the diffusion behavior of Al and Si between melts of more and less polymerized compositions, occurring at a NBO/T value of approximately 0.6, which may be indicative of a major change in melt structure. The hypothesized structural transition, the nature of which remains to be identified, may control other aspects of diffusion such as the sign of the activation volume for self diffusion of network-forming cations and the magnitude of the activation energy. The self diffusion coefficients of calcium, aluminum, silicon, and oxygen were used to calculate electrical conductivities of molten CaOAl 2O 3SiO 2 at 1500°C and 1 GPa using the generalized NernstEinstein relation. The estimated electrical conductivity implies that calcium, silicon, and oxygen contribute nearly equally to the total conductance: 31 \% from calcium, 29\% from silicon, and 30\% from oxygen, which is quite different from what one would expect for alkali-bearing melts in which Na and K are believed to be the dominant conducting species.},

	abstract = {A relatively long series of plankton and hydrographic samples for the West Greenland ecosystem allows us to explore links between climate, physical oceanography, and abundance of major zooplankton and ichthyoplankton species. These linkages, manifest in food chains, fish stocks dynamics, and regime shifts in large marine ecosystems are important for fisheries management. Patterns of change in larval fish abundances and hydrographic characteristics were analyzed with data from three transects off southwest Greenland sampled between 1925 and 1984. Factor analysis and orthogonal varimax rotation on 8 physical oceanographic variables highlighted gradients in salinity, temperature, and temperature range (stratification). The period in the 1950s tended to be warmer than the 1970s, and a period of low salinity was present in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Non-parametric density estimation methods identified associations between the hydrographic characteristics and the distributions of fish and shrimp larvae: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Redfish (Sebastes marinus and S. mentella), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), Long rough dab (Hippoglossoides platessoides), Wolffish (Anarhichas sp.), Sandeels (Ammodytes sp.) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The fish larvae were generally distributed non-randomly to at least one of the hydrographic characteristics and to the indices of plankton and copepod abundance. The fish and shrimp larvae showed generally stronger associations with the indices of plankton and copepod abundance than with the hydrographic characteristics. The patterns suggest a suite of fish species whose larvae are weakly adapted to different oceanographic conditions and different ecological niches. For all but sandeels, June and July abundances are likely to be higher when water masses are relatively saline and well stratified, and when plankton, especially copepods, are abundant. These relationships were then carried further to determine synchronous temporal patterns among oceanographic characteristics, abundance indices of zooplankton, fish larvae, and year-class strengths. There was a decreasing trend in the plankton abundance indices from the late 1950s and early 1960s to the 1970s as well as a weak significant positive association to sea temperature. This trend culminated in the year 1969 and 1970 the period of the “Great Salinity Anomaly”. The variability in time series of zooplankton, fish and shrimp larvae could not be related to an impact of the GSA. There were weak significant associations between Atlantic cod year-class strength (given number at age 3) and both temperature and cod larvae abundance. The patterns explain reasonably well the decline in cod, redfish and long rough dab as consequences of changes in the relative influences of the East Greenland Polar Current and the Irminger Current, but do not explain the major increases in shrimp and Greenland halibut in the 1980s and 1990s. At least the former may be a consequence of reduced predation mortality. The associations are also generally consistent with a survey series of adult groundfish started in the 1980s in East and West Greenland waters.},

	abstract = {Sudden increases in prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria are seen in both hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections. Examples include precipitate change in amikacin susceptibility in a hospital after years of low resistance, the abrupt increase in prevalence of β-lactamase-producing strains among gonococci isolated in one community, and rapid increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin among methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at a hospital shortly after the drug was introduced. Most dramatic are cases where organisms have abruptly become resistant to drugs that have worked clinically for decades (e.g. resistance to ampicillin in Haemophilus influenzae). Four types of mechanisms (other than laboratory artefact) for development of resistance can be postulated: introduction of resistant organisms into a previously susceptible population; acquisition of resistance by previously susceptible strains through genetic mutation or transfer of genetic material from another species or genus; emergence of a dormant resistance mechanism already present in the population; selection of resistant subpopulations of organisms. When any of these resistance mechanisms develop in a large proportion of the organisms, or in a few resistant organisms which are widely disseminated within the population, resistance can increase abruptly. It is likely that organisms will continue to use the mechanisms described here, and to develop additional ingenious ways to counter our antimicrobial weapons. Infection control personnel must rapidly uncover which mechanisms are involved so that appropriate measures (alternate drug regimens, isolation precautions, cohorting, etc.) can be instituted. Newer methods for typing of organisms can help identify which resistance mechanisms are involved in a given situation. Further study is also needed of the factors eliciting these dramatic changes; antimicrobial use is one but not the only contributor.},

A 7.75-m portion of piston core TUL99B-03 was deposited during a ∼3045-year interval [∼1440–4485 years before present (yBP)] under primarily anoxic conditions. Darker clay laminae were deposited under higher precipitation conditions in winter, and diatom-dominated laminae were laid down when marine productivity was higher in the spring through autumn. Wavelet transform and other time-series analysis methods were applied to sediment color (i.e. gray-scale values) line-scans obtained from X-ray images and compared with global records of cosmogenic nuclides 14C and 10Be, as well as the Ice Drift Index (hematite-stained grains) record to detect cycles, trends, and nonstationarities in the climate and sedimentary pattern. Our results show that the marine sedimentary record in the NE Pacific responded to abrupt changes and long-term variability in climate that can be linked to external forcing (e.g., solar and cosmic irradiance). Specifically, a strong cooling in the NE Pacific at ∼3550±160 yBP can be correlated to a weakening of high-frequency (50–150 years) pulses in sun activity at the Gleissberg cycle band, similar to what occurred at the onset of the ‘Little Ice Age’ at ∼1630 AD. Three intervals of unusually low sun activity at ∼2350, 2750, and ∼3350 yBP are characterized by thick, clay-rich annual sedimentation that we interpret as representative of unusually wet conditions. These intervals of higher precipitation conditions may have been related to a regional intensification of the Aleutian Low (AL) caused by an eastward migration of the Center of Action (COA) of the AL, which occurs during intervals of solar minima. Dryer conditions in the region occur when the COA of AL migrates westward and the COA of the North Pacific High (NPH) migrates northward during intervals of solar maxima. A cyclicity of 50–85, 33–36, and 22–29 years in the sediment color record, lamination thickness, and 14C cosmogenic nuclide, characterized the relatively warm interval from 3550 to 4485 yBP. This record is similar to that of present-day low- and high-frequency variants of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Aleutian Low.},

	abstract = {The influence of ligand electronegativity (EN) on the HgHg bonding in mercurous compounds has been investigated by calculations on a series of Hg2L2 species. The various calculated molecular properties are strongly dependent on the electronegativity of the attached ligand, where the EN of the “central” atom in the ligand (if the ligand L is a group) plays a major role. However, no strict correlation has been found. The EN value of 2.50 (value based on Mulliken's method) for the “central” atom appears to be a critical one for a classification of the compounds. For EN {\textgreater} 2.50, the variation of such molecular properties as HgHg bond length, HgHg force constant and reaction energy (Hg2L2 → HgL2 + Hg) is small with different ligands L, and these compounds are all stable against disproportionation, whereas an abrupt change in these molecular properties (mainly the HgHg bond length and the reaction energy) will occur on substitution by a ligand with “central” atom EN {\textless} 2.50, and also such compounds become rather unstable. This accounts for the fact that the Hg atoms are mostly bonded to halogen and oxygen in mercurous compounds. Also, the calculation supports the small variation of the HgHg bond lengths for different halogens, as found by a recent X-ray single crystal determination. We have also discussed the effect of the CH3CF3 substitution on the HgC bond length and other molecular properties. The calculated trends in most cases are opposite to the trends predicted from group electronegativities given in the literature, but are qualitatively consistent with some experimental evidence.},

	abstract = {Using multi-scale ideas from wavelet analysis, we extend singular-spectrum analysis (SSA) to the study of nonstationary time series, including the case where intermittency gives rise to the divergence of their variance. The wavelet transform resembles a local Fourier transform within a finite moving window whose width W, proportional to the major period of interest, is varied to explore a broad range of such periods. SSA, on the other hand, relies on the construction of the lag-correlation matrix C on M lagged copies of the time series over a fixed window width W to detect the regular part of the variability in that window in terms of the minimal number of oscillatory components; here W=MΔt with Δt as the time step. The proposed multi-scale SSA is a local SSA analysis within a moving window of width M≤W≤N, where N is the length of the time series. Multi-scale SSA varies W, while keeping a fixed W/M ratio, and uses the eigenvectors of the corresponding lag-correlation matrix C(M) as data-adaptive wavelets; successive eigenvectors of C(M) correspond approximately to successive derivatives of the first mother wavelet in standard wavelet analysis. Multi-scale SSA thus solves objectively the delicate problem of optimizing the analyzing wavelet in the time–frequency domain by a suitable localization of the signal’s correlation matrix. We present several examples of application to synthetic signals with fractal or power-law behavior which mimic selected features of certain climatic or geophysical time series. The method is applied next to the monthly values of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for 1933–1996; the SOI time series is widely believed to capture major features of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Tropical Pacific. Our methodology highlights an abrupt periodicity shift in the SOI near 1960. This abrupt shift between 5 and 3 years supports the Devil’s staircase scenario for the ENSO phenomenon (preliminary results of this study were presented at the XXII General Assembly of the European Geophysical Society, Vienna, May 1997, and at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union, San Francisco, December 1997).},

Mono-dispersed silica particles were synthesized by the sol–gel method and the particles were coated with silane coupling agents such as vinyltriethoxy silane (VTES) and γ-methacryloxypropyl triethoxy silane (MPTES). Although all the suspensions of identical particle volume fraction exhibited similar rheological behaviors at high shear rates, only the stabilized suspensions coated with either VTES or MPTES displayed smooth shear thinning rather than abrupt change in the shear viscosity, as is typical of suspensions with no surface treatment. The present study showed that the MPTES coating was very effective in enhancing the phase stability compared to the VTES coating. The flow-induced dichroism for the MPTES-coated suspensions did not experience sign change, while those of the non-stabilized suspensions changed sign as the shear rate was increased. The VTES-coated suspensions underwent a transition from a stable to an unstable state as the particle volume fraction increased. Specifically, the rheological behaviors of the VTES-coated suspensions of particle volume fraction 0.35 were similar to those of the MPTES-coated suspensions. When the volume fraction exceeded 0.45, however, the effect of VTES coating diminished. Finally, the stress-optical rule proposed by Bender and Wagner was adopted to model the stabilized suspensions considered here. The present results indicated that the stress-optical coefficient could be predicted successfully by the proposed stress-optical rule if the contribution from the hydrodynamic interaction is considered separately from the thermodynamic contribution.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a collection of four articles describing the San Luis Basin Sustainability Metrics Project. The Project developed a methodology for evaluating regional sustainability. This introduction provides the necessary background information for the project, description of the region, overview of the methods, and summary of the results. Although there are a multitude of scientifically based sustainability metrics, many are data intensive, difficult to calculate, and fail to capture all aspects of a system. We wanted to see if we could develop an approach that decision-makers could use to understand if their system was moving toward or away from sustainability. The goal was to produce a scientifically defensible, but straightforward and inexpensive methodology to measure and monitor environmental quality within a regional system. We initiated an interdisciplinary pilot project in the San Luis Basin, south-central Colorado, to test the methodology. The objectives were: 1) determine the applicability of using existing datasets to estimate metrics of sustainability at a regional scale; 2) calculate metrics through time from 1980 to 2005; and 3) compare and contrast the results to determine if the system was moving toward or away from sustainability. The sustainability metrics, chosen to represent major components of the system, were: 1) Ecological Footprint to capture the impact and human burden on the system; 2) Green Net Regional Product to represent economic welfare; 3) Emergy to capture the quality-normalized flow of energy through the system; and 4) Fisher information to capture the overall dynamic order and to look for possible regime changes. The methodology, data, and results of each metric are presented in the remaining four papers of the special collection. Based on the results of each metric and our criteria for understanding the sustainability trends, we find that the San Luis Basin is moving away from sustainability. Although we understand there are strengths and limitations of the methodology, we argue that each metric identifies changes to major components of the system.},

However, eddy covariance and related methods rely on assumptions about the boundary layer that might not hold above the complex, non-uniform, and fetch-limited surface of a feedlot. The objective of this study was to characterize the surface boundary layer of an open-air cattle feedlot to provide insight into how micrometeorological techniques might be applied to these non-ideal sites. An open-path eddy covariance system was used to collect high-frequency time-series data of wind speed, CO2, and H2O above a large commercial feedlot in central Kansas in 2006 and 2007. This site, like many High Plains locations, was characterized by windy conditions with daytime average wind speed of 5ms−1, and near-neutral atmospheric stability was common, even at night. Using a modeled displacement height of 0.65m, the roughness length ranged from 2 to 6cm with a median of 3.6cm. Ogives showed no signs of low-frequency transport (i.e. periods{\textgreater} 30min). Eddy covariance measurements of CO2 fluxes averaged 0.4kgm−2d−1 while H2O fluxes averaged 2.3kgm−2d−1, both of which agreed with other studies measuring cattle respiration or water consumption. The tower was located along the north edge of a rectangular-shaped feedlot so the fetch was over 1600m when winds were southerly. However, the length of fetch encompassed by feedlot pens decreased as winds became more southeasterly or southwesterly. Using the sharp contrast in CO2 fluxes from the pens versus the surrounding fields, the outer edge of the sampling footprint could be determined by observing abrupt changes in CO2 flux as wind directions shifted to the southeast or southwest. This provided a way to measure the footprint requirement using the respired CO2 from the cattle as a tracer. Under neutral atmospheric stability the required fetch was about 360m when the sensor height was 6m. The fetch requirements and the source area were predicted with a footprint model. Results showed that, on average, the three pens directly south of the tower contributed 61\% of the measured flux. Roads, feeding bunks, and transfer alleys (i.e. surfaces within the footprint other than pens) accounted for 21\% of the total area. Thus, accounting for the diluting effect of these spaces in the source area was important when attempting to compute a flux per unit animal or per unit pen area.},

	abstract = {Sequence stratigraphy studies the change in depositional trends in response to the interplay of accommodation and sediment supply, from the scale of individual depositional systems to entire sedimentary basin-fills. As accommodation is controlled by allogenic mechanisms that operate at basinal to global scales, the change in depositional trends is commonly synchronized among all environments established within a basin, thus providing the basis for the definition of systems tracts and the development of models of facies predictability. All classical sequence stratigraphic models assume the presence of an interior seaway within the basin under analysis and are centered around the direction and types of shoreline shifts, which control the timing of all systems tracts and sequence stratigraphic surfaces. In overfilled basins, dominated by nonmarine sedimentation, the definition of systems tracts is based on changes in fluvial accommodation, as inferred from the shifting balance between the various fluvial architectural elements. The method of sequence stratigraphy requires the application of the same set of core principles irrespective of the age of strata under analysis, from Precambrian to Phanerozoic. The study of Precambrian basins is often hampered by poorer stratal preservation and by a general lack of time control. However, where sedimentary facies are well preserved, the lack of time control may be partially compensated by a good knowledge of facies architecture and relationships, as well as by paleocurrent data. The latter are particularly important to understand the stratigraphic record of tectonically active basins, where abrupt shifts in paleoflow directions allow one to infer tectonic events and map the corresponding sequence-bounding unconformities. Arguably the most important contribution of Precambrian research to sequence stratigraphy is the better understanding of the mechanisms controlling stratigraphic cyclicity in the rock record, and hence of the criteria that should be employed in a system of sequence stratigraphic hierarchy. There is increasing evidence that the tectonic regimes which controlled the formation and evolution of sedimentary basins in the more distant geological past were much more erratic in terms of origin and rates than formerly inferred solely from the study of the Phanerozoic record. In this context, time is largely irrelevant as a parameter in the classification of stratigraphic sequences, and it is rather the stratigraphic record of changes in the tectonic setting that provides the key criteria for the basic subdivision of the rock record into basin-fill successions separated by first-order sequence boundaries. These first-order basin-fill successions are in turn subdivided into second- and lower-order sequences that result from shifts in the balance between accommodation and sedimentation at various scales of observation, irrespective of the time span between two same-order consecutive events. Sequences identified in any particular basin are not expected to correlate to other first- and lower-order sequences of other basins that may be similar in age but may have different timing and duration.},

	abstract = {Small angle neutron scattering intensities for sols and gels of the physically associating ionomer 1.39mol\% sodium sulphonated polystyrene with molecular weight 105g/mole in xylene have been obtained over a broad wavevector (q) and concentration range. In the low q and concentration range the scattering behaviour of this ionomer/solvent system can quite readily be interpreted using the open association aggregation model. In more concentrated solutions and at higher q, however, interpretation of the scattering behaviour for polymers associating via an open association mechanism (OAM) is more difficult, particularly if, as in this investigation, the single chains and aggregates have varying densities and fractal parameters. In this study various methods have been developed to interpret the low and high q scattering from systems whose extent of aggregation can be modelled using the OAM. Using these methods it has been possible to confirm that the open association model can be used to interpret the extent of aggregation of the above ionomer in xylene even after the solutions appear to be gelled. Single ionomer chains within both the dilute solutions and gels were found via modelling to have a radius of gyration of 60Å, which compares with dimensions of 25Å and 93Å calculated for a solid sphere of polystyrene or an unperturbed polystyrene Gaussian coil, respectively. The aggregates, however, all had radii of gyration comparable with what would be expected for polystyrene of the aggregate molecular weight in an unperturbed state. These results suggest that gelation of ionomer solutions at particular concentration thresholds is not due to an abrupt change in the aggregate structures at some critical concentration but occurs as a result of interactions between the very large aggregates that the OAM predicts should gradually form as the ionomer concentration increases.},

	abstract = {The annual flood cycle in the Okavango Delta is the basis of subsistence of the local population, providing water, arable land and wetland resources. Additionally, it forms the basis of a large tourism industry. Flooding in the Okavango Delta is, however, very variable both at short and long term time scales. Past research suggested the influence of factors such as tectonic activity, sedimentation, vegetation change or human influence on the spatial distribution of floodwaters. Change in the flooding regime at any given site is thus often perceived as an effect of permanent change in the system, and this perception results in unnecessary demands for engineering interventions in the system. However, it is possible that some of the perceived changes in flood regime are apparent transient effects of non-linearity of the system and variation in hydrological inputs. Hydrometric data and satellite-derived flood maps are analysed here using statistical methods (covariance analysis and double mass analysis) to distinguish between temporal and permanent changes in various parts of the Okavango Delta. The analyses reveal that system non-linearity causes the hydrological responses of the Okavango Delta to be non-proportional to the inputs. Periods of one to several consecutive years are present when flood extents and outflows are either considerably higher or lower (flow or flood regimes) than what would be expected considering the magnitude of inflow. Such effects are visible throughout the entire system, or only in some distributaries, and do not, as previously thought, represent permanent change in flood distribution. However, flood regime change that appears to result from a physical change in the system has been detected. This change has a nature of shift in flood distribution between the Thaoge and the Xudum, with the latter receiving more water after 1997 at the expense of the former and causing 2004 re-flooding of Lake Ngami.},

	abstract = {This study was designed to assess the accuracy of a new noninvasive frequency analysis method for predicting patients with inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) at electrophysiologic study and hence the risk of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms from 3 orthogonal bipolar surface leads were evaluated using a microcomputer-based frequency analysis system that performs analysis of conventional timedomain late potentials as well as incorporating a new technique for spectral analysis of relatively short, overlapping signal segments spanning the whole QRS complex. The spectral analysis technique measured abnormalities anywhere in the entire QRS complex and did so without dependence on any arbitrarily defined frequency, duration or amplitude cutoffs. The hallmark of arrhythmogenic abnormality was hypothesized to be frequent and abrupt changes in the frequency signature of the QRS wave front velocity as it propagates throughout the ventricle around areas of abnormal conduction, resulting in a high degree of spectral turbulence. One-hundred forty-two subjects were studied, including 71 totally normal control subjects (“true negatives”), 33 with both late potentials by time-domain analysis and inducible sustained monomorphic VT (“true positives”), 28 with late potentials but no evidence of spontaneous or inducible sustained monomorphic VT (“false positives”) and 10 with inducible sustained monomorphic VT but absence of time-domain late potentials (“false negatives”). The frequency analysis technique correctly classified 100\% of the true negatives, 97\% of the true positives, 86\% of the late potentials false positives and 60\% of the late potentials false negatives. The total predictive accuracy of frequency analysis for all groups was 94\%, compared with 73\% for time-domain late potential analysis. The results suggest that a high degree of spectral turbulence of the overall QRS signal during sinus rhythm may provide a more accurate marker for the anatomic-electrophysiologic substrate of reentrant tachyarrhythmias than detection of late potentials in the terminal QRS region by either time- or frequencydomain analysis. Spectral turbulence analysis is applicable to patients irrespective of the QRS duration and the presence or absence of bundle branch block.},

This surface charge was incorporated in a model based on the Teorell-Meyer-Sievers theory to calculate the rejection of nanofiltration membranes under the assumption of constant membrane potential. The model was fitted using NaCl rejection measurements at pH 7 for a salt concentration of 5 mmol/1 to determine two membrane parameters, the pore radius and the ratio of pore density and membrane thickness. The membranes tested were the Desal 5DK and the PVDI nanofiltration membranes with a molecular weight cutoff below 300. The membranes are positively charged below the isoelectric point around pH 4 and negatively charged at higher pH values. Using the fitted parameter, the calculated rejection is compared with experiments for different concentrations at pH 7, for ternary ion mixtures and for different pH values. The concentration dependant rejection for NaCl could be well predicted in the concentration range between 2 and 50 mmol/1. The agreement was also very good for calculated and measured rejections of NaCl and Na2SO4 mixtures. A minimum in rejection was found for both membranes, which corresponds well with the isoelectric point in the case of the PVDI membrane, but which is at a higher pH for the Desal 5DK membrane. The NaCl rejection as a function of pH could be well predicted for the PVDI membrane, but there are considerable deviations in the low pH range for the Na2SO4 rejection for the same membrane as well as for the NaCl rejection for the Desal5 DK. The method presented also gives some insight in the mechanisms leading to the abrupt changes in rejection around the isoelectric point of the membranes.},

Recent developments in methods for identifying and quantifying VAM fungi, both in soil and within roots, should enable the clearer definition of the factors that influence their distribution. Careful attention must be paid to sampling procedures to avoid bias and subjectivity. Soils commonly contain more than one VAM fungus. The development of VA mycorrhizas varies with soil type and depth, season and vegetation. The dynamics of root colonization by individual species within a population have not been adequately explored. Minor or gradual disturbances in agricultural and natural ecosystems may, or may not, lead to marked changes in mycorrhiza formation. Populations of VAM fungi appear to be capable of adjusting to gradual changes in the environment without abrupt changes in the extent of colonization. In contrast, more extreme, or rapid environmental changes such as those associated with mining or erosion, may markedly decrease mycorrhiza formation. The restoration of populations of mycorrhizal fungi will depend on the availability of accessible sources of propagules and on the suitability of the disturbed soils for plant and fungal growth.},

	abstract = {The intrinsic inability to withstand compression is a challenge in numerical simulation of a membrane with the finite element method. Basically there are two possibilities to deal with this problem. On the one hand wrinkles would be detected in detail by a refined mesh of shell elements once a bending formulation is used. On the other hand this problem is computed on a coarser mesh of membrane elements augmented with a wrinkling model, which considers effects of unresolved deformation patterns. This contribution focuses on the material modification approach, which is considered as a member of the latter. Within this category, works in [P.

Rossi, Light Weight Structures: Structural Analysis and Coupling Issues, Ph.D. Diss., The university of Bologna, 2005] are attractive because their wrinkling models on a coarse grid are simple and intuitive. The basic idea of this model is as follows: whenever compression occurs in a membrane, the corresponding components of the constitutive tensor in the direction of the compressive stress are penalized to weaken the compressive stiffness of the membrane. However, such abrupt change causes inevitably an unphysical oscillation of stress redistribution. Therefore, an algorithm to stabilize this oscillation is required. The first objective of this paper is to give a systematic verification of a wrinkling model based on the material modification approach by means of an analogy between wrinkling and plasticity. The second one is to include this model in a static analysis for both isotropic and orthotropic membranes. This model holds following advantages: it is computationally inexpensive and virtually able to reproduce the exact stress field, caused by wrinkling, on a macroscopic scale. To the author’s knowledge applications of a material modification approach with orthotropic materials are scarcely available. This paper demonstrates the potential of the model by means of numerical examples, compared to ones in literature.},

	abstract = {Statement of problem Clinicians have used resistance form as a basis for determining guidelines for preparation design to ensure clinical success of cemented cast restorations. Disagreement on whether clinical success follows the on-off or linear nature of resistance form continues. Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the number of cycles required to dislodge a cemented complete crown casting under a cyclic lateral load as a function of taper and to compare this relationship for the resistive and nonresistive ranges of taper. Material and methods Three dies were milled from stainless steel at each of the following tapers: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 degrees. A gold-palladium metal-ceramic alloy crown was fabricated for each die, cemented, and subjected to lateral cyclic loading until failure or 1,000,000 cycles. The limiting taper for the dies with their given height and base was 26.6 degrees. Dies with taper less than 26.6 degrees had resistance form, whereas dies with taper larger than 26.6 degrees did not. A linear regression (α=.05) was used to evaluate the relation of cycles at dislodgement to taper. Results The average number of cycles to crown dislodgement or completion for each taper (SD), in units of 10,000, was as follows: 4 degrees, 100 (0); 8 degrees, 100 (0); 12 degrees, 93.54 (16.56); 16 degrees, 61.33 (38.47); 20 degrees, 25.73 (34.67); 24 degrees, 4.33 (7.36); 28 degrees, 0.06 (0.08); and 32 degrees, 0.05 (0.09). The crowns in the resistive area less than 26.6 degrees that demonstrated failure showed a linear regression with a correlation coefficient of −0.995 between the average number of cycles to dislodge the crown and the taper. The slope was significantly different from zero (P=.0048), with a value of −7.58 and a standard error of 0.53. Conclusion The number of cycles required to cause crown dislodgement was linear after 12 degrees in the resistive area and nearly zero for preparations in the nonresistive area. The limiting taper concept closely predicted the transition point where the slope of the graph of cycles to dislodgement as a function of taper abruptly changed.},

As a result, very little is known about what knowledge, skills and abilities, or professional competencies are needed, or how professional competency requirements may change depending on the circumstances of a disaster. The objective of this pilot study was to collect, explore, and describe background data on professional competencies from health care providers who were involved in the Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita disaster responses. Methods Utilizing an anonymous survey of a convenience sample, 200 health care providers attending 2 disaster conferences were asked to respond to open-ended questions about the competencies they needed and performed during their disaster response. Results Of the 200 respondents, registered nurses (37\%) and physicians (24\%) were the largest categories of providers. Basic clinical care (39\%) and triage (26\%) were the most frequent response skills reported; the areas wherein respondents felt least prepared were disaster-specific response skills (22\%) and systems issues (34\%). Only 22\% of respondents reported that they did not know a specific skill. The 200 respondents made 495 individual recommendations for future responders, including actions to improve the respondent's personal preparedness (23\%) and the need for training (25\%). However, only 3\% of the recommendations (n = 15) actually identified a specific type of training such as Advanced Cardiac Life Support or triage. Conclusion Few respondents reported knowledge deficits. Rather, what they described was an abrupt change or transition from their everyday practice worlds that required accommodation in order to practice effectively. Current training programs generally focus on providing skills information. Further research is required to determine if training programs should address facilitating the transition process.},

The conventional unit cell parameters a and γ show abrupt changes at 19°C from a = 5.61 Å and γ = 119.3° (pseudohexagonal) to a = 5.67 Å and γ = 120.0° (hexagonal), indicating a sharp first order transition. The change is ascribed to a dilatation of the spacing that occurs predominantly in one direction [1̄,1]. The rotational motion of the chains around the chain axes in phase II is examined in the vicinity of the transition point through the temperature dependence of a reflection on the second layer line. No evident increase in the rotational motion around the chain axis can be detected up to the transition point, which is again indicative of a clear first order nature of the transition. The chain packings in phases II and IV are simulated by the MC method used in our previous paper. It is shown that phases II and IV show marked differences in their chain packings.

We have calculated the equilibrium structures and isomerization rates of small metal particles as functions of number of atoms and temperature by the Monte Carlo method using various forms of interatomic potetials fitted to Ni and to Pd. At low temperature, surface site coordinations, interatomic distances, and surface tension are calculated as functions of particles size. For small particles icosahedral structures containing five atom rings are the most stable, while for large particles crystalline or quasicrystalline structures are the most stable. Upon heating, surface roughening takes place leading to changes in site coordinations. Continuous changes in particle structures can occur at high temperature on a microsecond time scale. Several isomers which exhibit differnt structure are found, and the interconversion rate between these isomers is determined. A discontinuous transition as a function of temperature is observed for particles containing more than atoms thirty which is manifested by an abrupt change in coordination sites at the transition temperature. The first order transition in particle structure would result in different activation energies for reaction as a function of temperature and in large deviations from classical Arrhenius behavior. These results predict that highly non-classical kinetics could be observed in small catalyst particles.},

	abstract = {Background During the past decade, our practice of performing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has changed dramatically, most notably by an abrupt shift from routine to selective preoperative angiography, reliance on defined care plans with full-time nurse practitioner oversight, and increasing reliance on eversion endarterectomy and cervical block anesthesia. This study was designed to determine whether these shifts in policy have been associated with lower costs without sacrificing clinical outcome. Methods All patients undergoing CEA from July 1993 to December 2000 were identified, and inpatient and outpatient charts were reviewed. Cost data were obtained from the central hospital accounting system and converted to 2001 dollars. Thirty-day outcomes and costs were quantified each year and compared between each of 2 temporally well-defined groups: those undergoing “routine” versus “selective” angiography and those cared for before and after defined patient care protocols were instituted. Results A total of 1168 CEAs were analyzed. Thirty-day combined stroke and death rate was 3.1\%, and no trends or significant differences over time were seen. From 1993 to 2000 the cost of CEA fell from \$9302 to \$6216 (P{\textless}.0002), and length of stay was reduced 1 full day (P=.005). Institution of “selective” angiography was associated with an immediate cost savings of approximately \$2000 per case (P{\textless}.0001), and nurse practitioner oversight along with institution of defined clinical protocols with a \$530 (P{\textless}.05) decline in nonoperating room–related costs. Conclusions Changes in policy from routine to selective angiography, reliance on defined postoperative care pathways, eversion endarterectomy, and cervical block anesthesia have been associated with significant cost savings, with no compromise in clinical outcome at our institution.},

	abstract = {Objective We assessed the relationship between cerebral ischemia-induced changes in evoked potentials and the degree of ischemia tolerance. Methods 47 patients underwent somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring in intracranial aneurysm surgery. Three duration parameters (time) were recorded: Time 1, from the starting of temporary occlusion unavoidable in aneurysm surgery to the time the evoked potentials decrease from basal level to reaching the warning criterion; Time 2, from evoked potentials reaching the warning criterion to the time the blood flow was resumed; Time 3, after resuming the blood flow, the time it took the evoked potentials to recover to baseline. All three times can be reliably calculated in the SEP recording, but not in the MEP recording which consisted of either unchanged amplitudes or abruptly changing amplitudes, making it impossible to obtain Time 1. The ischemic tolerance ratio (ITR) was calculated as ITR=time 2/time 1×100\%. New decreasing myodynamia and fresh infarction after the surgery were employed for evaluating neurological deficits postoperatively, and their correlations with the ischemia-induced changes of evoked potentials recorded during the surgery were analyzed. Results We found a change in SEPs in 12 patients whose cerebral ischemia was induced by temporary occlusion of the aneurysm's parent artery. We also found the development of postoperative neurological deficits in 4 patients whose ischemic tolerance ratio (ITR) reached over 80\%, while no deficits were found in the other 8 patients whose ITR was less than 50\%. MEP changes were seen in 4 patients whose cerebral ischemia was caused by accidentally clamping the perforating branches, causing the development of postoperative neurological deficits but not necessarily leading to significant SEP changes. Conclusion The Ischemia tolerance ratio (ITR) in SEP recordings is valuable to predicting postoperative neurological deficits caused by temporary occlusion of aneurysm's parent artery. Maintaining the ITR under 50\% during operation can effectively avoid postoperative neurological deficits, while an ITR above 80\% reliably forecasts postoperative neurological deficits. Complementary to SEPs, MEP recordings are particularly valuable in monitoring ischemic effects caused by accidentally clamping perforating branches. Taken together, this system of monitoring makes it possible to promptly adjust surgery procedures and minimize postoperative neurological deficits.},

	abstract = {Building automation systems (BASs) are extensively utilized in fault detection and isolation (FDI) of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) processes. Usually a BAS, which is directly interfaced to the process only monitors or collects data for the FDI algorithm. Rarely both control and monitoring actions of the automation system are harnessed for FDI. However, in buildings such a diagnostic approach is possible and illustrated in this paper. The fault detection is based on an on-line diagnostic test (ODT), which is a series of control and monitoring actions applied to a process. Performing an ODT means exciting the automated process by using prescribed input signals, supervising responses and comparing results with a process model. All operations are performed on-line, during normal up state of the process and controlled by the automation system. The fault detection method is outlined for an air-handling unit (AHU) and implemented for its preheating process. The approach is demonstrated in a real building by programming the diagnostic algorithms in a BEMS, installed in a college building and further performing test runs. Faults are detected by comparing gathered data with a statistical model. Due to the difficulties in generating natural faults, a few artificial faults were introduced. The test runs show that the ODT is an uncomplicated diagnostic method for finding distinct and abrupt changes in a process but not for detection of slow degradations and gradual faults. Moreover, the ODT seems to be generic over faults and processes, requires no additional instrumentation and no more than domain knowledge for initiation.},

	doi = {10.1017/jfm.2016.101},
	abstract = {We model the unsteady evolution of turbulent buoyant plumes following temporal changes to the source conditions. The integral model is derived from radial integration of the governing equations expressing the evolution of mass, axial momentum and buoyancy in the plume. The non-uniform radial profiles of the axial velocity and density deficit in the plume are explicitly captured by shape factors in the integral equations; the commonly assumed top-hat profiles lead to shape factors equal to unity. The resultant model for unsteady plumes is hyperbolic when the momentum shape factor, determined from the radial profile of the mean axial velocity in the plume, differs from unity. The solutions of the model when source conditions are maintained at constant values are shown to retain the form of the well-established steady plume solutions. We demonstrate through a linear stability analysis of these steady solutions that the inclusion of a momentum shape factor in the governing equations that differs from unity leads to a well-posed integral model. Therefore, our model does not exhibit the mathematical pathologies that appear in previously proposed unsteady integral models of turbulent plumes. A stability threshold for the value of the shape factor is also identified, resulting in a range of its values where the amplitudes of small perturbations to the steady solutions decay with distance from the source. The hyperbolic character of the system of equations allows the formation of discontinuities in the fields describing the plume properties during the unsteady evolution, and we compute numerical solutions to illustrate the transient development of a plume following an abrupt change in the source conditions. The adjustment of the plume to the new source conditions occurs through the propagation of a pulse of fluid through the plume. The dynamics of this pulse is described by a similarity solution and, through the construction of this new similarity solution, we identify three regimes in which the evolution of the transient pulse following adjustment of the source qualitatively differs.},

Soil chemistry is hypothesised to be equilibrated with the recent water regime. Profiles of three soil types on the soilscape with descriptions, analyses, long-term soil water content and water tension data are discussed and 15 auger observations with descriptions and MIR data are used to develop a conceptual response model. Morphology was able to identify the primary response of soils. The deep interflow Cambisol on the midslope has a vertical flowpath through the first subsoil, indicated by the red apedal morphology, which combines with interflow in the second subsoil, indicated by stagnic colour patterns. The responsive Gleysol on the footslope is a storage mechanism, indicating permanently saturated conditions. The responsive Luvisol at the toeslope has interflow in the Albic horizon while the subsoils act as a storage mechanism. pH and base saturation were used to indicate leaching (flowpath), ferrolysis (fluctuating watertable), acid weathering and accumulation (water saturation). Iron and Mn were used as indicators of reducing conditions to infer the duration of saturation. Soil response was verified by water contents and tension data. Pedological processes were correlated to horizons and hydrological response. Chemistry was more sensitive to water regime change than soil morphology. Therefore soil chemistry was successfully used in designing a conceptual hydrological response model and improved identification of hydrological processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

	doi = {10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.09.018},
	abstract = {A major goal in harmful algal bloom (HAB) research has been to identify mechanisms underlying interannual variability in bloom magnitude and impact. Here the focus is on variability in Alexandrium fundyense blooms and paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxicity in Maine, USA, over 34 years (1978-2011). The Maine coastline was divided into two regions - eastern and western Maine, and within those two regions, three measures of PSP toxicity (the percent of stations showing detectable toxicity over the year, the cumulative amount of toxicity per station measured in all shellfish (mussel) samples during that year, and the duration of measurable toxicity) were examined for each year in the time series. These metrics were combined into a simple HAB Index that provides a single measure of annual toxin severity across each region. The three toxin metrics, as well as the HAB Index that integrates them, reveal significant variability in overall toxicity between individual years as well as long-term, decadal patterns or regimes. Based on different conceptual models of the system, we considered three trend formulations to characterize the long-term patterns in the Index - a three-phase (mean-shift) model, a linear two-phase model, and a pulse-decline model. The first represents a “regime shift” or multiple equilibria formulation as might occur with alternating periods of sustained high and low cyst abundance or favorable and unfavorable growth conditions, the second depicts a scenario of more gradual transitions in cyst abundance or growth conditions of vegetative cells, and the third characterizes a “sawtooth” pattern in which upward shifts in toxicity are associated with major cyst recruitment events, followed by a gradual but continuous decline until the next pulse. The fitted models were compared using both residual sum of squares and Akaike's Information Criterion. There were some differences between model fits, but none consistently gave a better fit than the others. This statistical underpinning can guide efforts to identify physical and/or biological mechanisms underlying the patterns revealed by the HAB Index. Although A. fundyense cyst survey data (limited to 9 years) do not span the entire interval of the shellfish toxicity records, this analysis leads us to hypothesize that major changes in the abundance of A. fundyense cysts may be a primary factor contributing to the decadal trends in shellfish toxicity in this region. The HAB Index approach taken here is simple but represents a novel and potentially useful tool for resource managers in many areas of the world subject to toxic HABs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Thirdly, a novel wavelet comb filter for harmonic detection is put forward. The quandrature mirror filters (QMFs') are used to realize the improved wavelet transform to implement the novel wavelet comb filter, which can be applied to the detection and time-frequency analysis of short duration harmonies, and can detect all neighboring harmonies and their time-frequency characteristics precisely. Simulation results indicate that the new wavelet synchronous detector and wavelet comb filter can overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods and show excellent performance.},

In this article, I identify two problematical aspects of Capoccia and Ziblatt's intervention. First, methodologically, I argue that the focus on contingency and actors' choices in individual cases is worth little in the absence of controlled comparisons. Second, and empirically, I show that it is very difficult to see how unconstrained choices during critical junctures might have brought into existence such a systematical variation as that encountered in the case of European democratization in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. On this basis, I issue a warning against accepting the new research agenda across-the-board, arguing that this would have detrimental consequences for comparative historical analysis of regime change.},

The same output of a SVM may correspond to different types of faults and the final decision is made by all SVMs instead of one SVM. Moreover, a residual-based fault detection method using a time-variant threshold is developed to identify the abrupt change and scaling faults.

To demonstrate the broad applicability and utility of this georeferencing approach, we identified collision hotspots at two additional urban areas in North America.

We surveyed 36 transects stratified across a gradient of urbanization and water availability along the Salt River, a riparian corridor that is monitored as part of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research study system located in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Habitat and landscape variables were reduced via Principal Component Analysis to be used in a constrained ordination that identified waterbird community composition patterns, and then used to model the responses of guild abundance and diversity. Habitat and landscape components from the constrained ordination explained 39\% of the variation in the waterbird community. Land use components were related to the suite of species at each site, but had a weaker relationship to guild abundance or diversity. Habitat-level components (water physiognomy, shoreline composition, and terrestrial vegetation cover) were more important in predicting both guild abundance and diversity. We found that water physiognomy was the strongest driver shaping waterbird community parameters. The implications of our study are relevant to urban planning in arid cities, offering the opportunity to design and improve wildlife habitat while providing other important public amenities.},

The Red vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer), a tropical passerine bird that has been introduced widely across locations of high conservation value, is considered an extreme pest. It is currently expanding its range in New Caledonia, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. Decisive recommendations on management strategies are required urgently to inform local managers and policy makers, but they should be based on quantitative local evidence, not just on expert opinion. The Red-vented bulbul is widely blamed for its impacts on biodiversity, especially through competition. We used data from 2,472 point counts to explore the abundance relationships between the Red-vented bulbul and 14 other species of bird. Our results revealed a negative relationship between the occurrence of the bulbul and the mean abundance of nine species, all native (or endemic, n = 3) to the New Caledonia archipelago. In contrast, the abundance of other introduced species such as Acridotheres tristis (Common myna), Passer domesticus (House sparrow) and Spilopelia chinensis (Spotted dove) were not affected by the Red-vented bulbul. Moreover, temporal trends in the abundance of impacted species suggest that the Red-vented bulbul may cause niche contractions rather than mortality for native species in man-modified habitats. Monitoring and control of the Red-vented bulbul is recommended to prevent on-going impacts on native bird communities throughout New Caledonia, and its impact on native bird communities elsewhere should be quantified.},

The effect of urbanization on bird diversity has been widely investigated in many cities worldwide; however, our knowledge on urban bird communities from the eastern Mediterranean region is very scarce. In this context, we aimed to investigate the effect of the different land-cover types on bird species richness and abundance in a densely built coastal Mediterranean city (Patras, Greece) during the breeding and wintering seasons. We sampled the bird community in 90 randomly selected sites along an urbanization gradient. Open green spaces proved to be the most significant factor favouring bird diversity in both seasons. In winter, woody vegetation and impervious surfaces had a positive effect on species richness as well. The local bird community consisted of a large number of species associated with open and semi-open unmanaged green areas, 12 of which are Species of European Conservation Concern (SPECs) showing a declining trend in Europe. On the other hand, in winter the number of forest-dwellers increased significantly. Species richness was significantly higher in winter indicating that the urban environment provides important wintering grounds. Thus, management actions in cities with similar characteristics in the Mediterranean region should focus on the maintenance of open green spaces and woody vegetation patches to enhance bird diversity.},

I analysed how species richness and, in particular, how community composition (relative proportion of different ecological groups) was influenced by size of urban green spaces, presence of native forest, isolation (i.e. distance from the periphery of the city) and urban zone (i.e. centre or periphery of city). Species richness increased with size of green spaces and presence of native forest, but did not decrease towards the city centre. Community composition was affected most strongly by presence of native forest, but site size and urbanization affected some ecological groups. Specifically, sensitive ecological groups of birds (in particular forest species, ground-nesters, migratory species, and species with a specialist diet) depended in particular on the presence of native forest in urban green spaces, with additional positive effects of increasing size of urban green spaces and location close to the periphery of the city.},

Considering the extensive and increasing encroachment of light pollution around the world, we evaluated the association of the annual mean ALAN intensity over land within the geographic ranges of 298 nocturnally migrating bird species with five factors: phase of annual cycle, mean distance between breeding and non-breeding ranges, range size, global hemisphere of range, and IUCN category of conservation concern. Light pollution within geographic ranges was relatively greater during the migration season, for shorter-distance migrants, for species with smaller ranges, and for species in the western hemisphere. Our results suggest that migratory birds may be subject to the effects of light pollution particularly during migration, the most critical stage in their annual cycle. We hope these results will spur further research on how light pollution affects not only migrating birds, but also other highly mobile animals throughout their annual cycle.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is one of the most extreme forms of environmental alteration, posing a major threat to biodiversity. We studied the effects of urbanization on avian communities via a systematic review using hierarchical and categorical meta-analyses. Altogether, we found 42 observations from 37 case studies for species richness and 23 observations from 20 case studies for abundance. Urbanization had an overall strong negative effect on bird species richness, whereas abundance increased marginally with urbanization. There was no evidence that city size played a role in influencing the relationship between urbanization and either species richness or abundance. Studies that examined long gradients (i.e. from urban to rural) were more likely to detect negative urbanization effects on species richness than studies that considered short gradients (i.e. urban vs. suburban or urban vs. rural areas). In contrast, we found little evidence that the effect of urbanization on abundance was influenced by gradient length. Effects of urbanization on species richness were more negative for studies including public green spaces (parks and other amenity areas) in the sampled landscapes. In contrast, studies performed solely in the urban matrix (i.e. no green spaces) revealed a strong positive effect on bird abundance. When performing subset analyses on urban-suburban, suburban-rural and suburban-natural comparisons, species richness decreased from natural to urban areas, but with a stronger decrease at the urban-suburban interface, whereas bird abundance showed a clear intermediate peak along the urban-rural gradient although abundance in natural areas was comparable to that in suburban areas. This suggests that species loss happens especially at the urban-suburban interface, and that the highest abundances occur in suburban areas compared to urban or rural areas. Thus, our study shows the importance of suburban areas, where the majority of birds occur with fairly high species richness.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is thought to decrease riparian tree canopy cover, but this outcome may vary depending on geographic context. We examined changes in land cover and riparian tree canopy near Sacramento, California, a Mediterranean climate region impacted by agriculture before urbanization. We used aerial imagery to quantify changes in land cover and the area, width, and density of riparian tree canopy between 1937 and 2014 for the 85-km(2) Arcade Creek watershed. While watershed land cover shifted almost entirely from pasture and crops to urban development, riparian forested area increased by 38 percent. The median width of riparian tree canopy more than doubled, and the density along smaller streams increased significantly (p {\textless} 0.0001). We used multiple data sources to examine potential drivers of these changes. Stream gage data and field observations indicated that the formerly intermittent Arcade Creek stream network receives spatially and temporally variable dry-season flow subsidies from urban runoff, but widespread channel incision may limit the impact of subsidies on riparian vegetation. Accordingly, sampling of riparian woody plants showed few hydrophilic species growing along these streams. Instead we found evidence of native oak regeneration and a high density of escaped horticultural species. The increase in riparian forest cover was thus likely due to changes in vegetation management and species composition from land use conversion, possibly augmented by increased dry-season water availability. The changes in canopy cover we quantified stand in contrast to the accepted pattern of riparian forest decline with urbanization, and are expected to affect ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Urbanisation is regarded as one of the most threatening global issues for wildlife, however, measuring its impact is not always straight forward. Oxidative stress physiology has been suggested to be a useful biomarker of health and therefore, a potentially important indicator of the impact that urban environmental stressors, especially air pollution, can have on wildlife. For example, nitrogen oxides (NOx), released during incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, are highly potent pro-oxidants, thus predicted to affect either the protective antioxidants and/or cause oxidative damage to bio-molecules. To date, epidemiological modelling of the predicted association between oxidative stress and NOx exposure has not been performed in wild animals. Here, we address this short-coming, by investigating multiple oxidative stress markers in four common passerine bird species, the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), great tit (Parus major), house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and tree sparrow (Passer montanus), living along a gradient of NOx and urbanisation levels in southern Sweden. First of all, the results revealed that long-and medium-term (one month and one week, respectively) NOx levels were highly correlated with the level of urbanisation. This confirms that the commonly used urbanisation index is a reliable proxy for urban air pollution. Furthermore, in accordance to our prediction, individuals exposed to higher long-and medium-term NOx levels/urbanisation had higher plasma antioxidant capacity. However, only tree sparrows showed higher oxidative damage (protein carbonyls) in relation to NOx levels and this association was absent with urbanisation. Lipid peroxidation, glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels did not co-vary with NOx/urbanisation. Given that most oxidative stress biomarkers showed strong species-specificity, independent of variation in NOx/urbanisation, the present study highlights the need to study variation in oxidative stress across contexts, seasons and life-stages in order to understand how the ecology and phylogeny of species interact to affect species resilience to urban environmental stress.

	abstract = {While color Doppler flow mapping has yielded a quick and relatively sensitive method for visualizing the turbulent jets generated in valvular insufficiency, quantification of the degree of valvular insufficiency has been limited by the dependence of visualization of turbulent jets on hemodynamic as well as instrument-related factors. Color Doppler flow imaging, however, does have the capability of reliably showing the spatial relations of laminar flows. An area where flow accelerates proximal to a regurgitant orifice is commonly visualized on the left ventricular side of a mitral regurgitant orifice, especially when imaging is performed with high grain and a low pulse repetition frequency. This area of flow convergence, where the flow stream narrows symmetrically, can be quantified because velocity and the flow cross-sectional area change in inverse proportion along streamlines centered at the orifice. In this study, a gravity-driven constant-flow system with five sharp-edges diaphragm orifices (ranging from 2.9 to 12 mm in diameter) was imaged both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of flow through the orifice. Color Doppler flow images were produced by zero shifting so that the abrupt change in display color occurred at different velocities. This “aliasing boundary” with a known velocity and a measurable radial distance from the center of the orifice was used to determine an isovelocity hemisphere such that flow rate through the orifice was calculated as 2-pi-r2 x V(r), where r is the radial distance from the center of the orifice to the color change and V(r) is the velocity at which the color change was noted. Using V(r) values from 54 to 14 cm/sec obtained with a 3.75-MHz transducer from 75 to 18 cm/sec obtained with a 2.5-MHz transducer, we calculated flow rates and found them to correlate with measured flow rates (r = 0.94-0.99). The slope of the regression line was closest to unity when the lowest V(r) and the correspondingly largest r were used in calculation. The flow rates estimated from color Doppler flow imaging could also be used in conjunction with continuous-wave Doppler measurements of the maximal velocity of flow through the orifice to calculate orifice areas (r = 0.75-0.96 correlation with measured areas). In a clinical series of 20 patients studied prospectively, radius of the flow convergence area separated patients with angiographically mild from those with moderate (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.001) and patients with angiographically moderate from those with severe (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.005) mitral regurgitation and showed good correlation with the angiographic severity of regurgitation ( r= 0.87). Color Doppler visualization of the flow convergence region is a method that appears promising for providing a calculated value of flow rate for a regurgitant orifice in the cardiovascular system. When used in conjunction with continuous-wave Doppler, color Doppler flow imaging can be used to predict the orifice area.},

As a result of overload in the stretched position, the fast contracting tibialis anterior muscle in an adult rabbit is induced to synthesize much new protein and to grow by as much as 30\% within a period as short as 4 days. This very rapid hypertrophy was found to be associated with an increase of up to 250\% in the RNA content of the muscles and an abrupt change in the species of RNA produced. Both stretch alone and electrical stimulation alone caused repression of the fast-type genes and activation of the slow-type genes. It appears that the fast-type IIB genes are the default genes, but that the skeletal slow genes are expressed as a response to overload and stretch.

	abstract = {Focal mechanisms of 32 North American midplate earthquakes (m(b) = 3.8-6.5) were evaluated to determine if slip is compatible with a broad-scale regional stress field derived from plate-driving forces and, if so, under what conditions (stress regime, pore pressure, and frictional coefficient). Using independent information on in situ stress orientations from well bore breakout and hydraulic fracturing data and assuming that the regional principal stresses are in approximately horizontal and vertical planes (+/-10-degrees), the constraint that the slip vector represents the direction of maximum resolved shear stress on the fault plane was used to calculate relative stress magnitudes defined by the parameter phi = (S2 - S3)/(S1 - S3) from the fault/stress geometry. As long as the focal mechanism has a component of oblique slip (i.e., the B axis does not coincide with the intermediate principal stress direction), this calculation identifies which of the two nodal planes is a geometrically possible slip plane (Gephart, 1985). Slip in a majority of the earthquakes (25 of 32) was found to be geometrically compatible with reactivation of favorably oriented preexisting fault planes in response to the broad-scale uniform regional stress field. Slip in five events was clearly inconsistent with the regional stress field and appears to require a localized stress anomaly to explain the seismicity. Significantly, all five of these events occurred prior to 1970 (when many regional networks were installed), and their focal mechanisms are inconsistent with more recent solutions of nearby smaller events. The frictional likelihood of the geometrically possible slip on the selected fault planes was evaluated in the context of conventional frictional faulting theory. The ratio of shear to normal stress on the fault planes at hypocentral depth was calculated relative to an assumed regional stress field. Regional stress magnitudes were determined from (1) S1/S3 ratios based on the frictional strength of optimally oriented faults (the basis for the linear brittle portion of lithospheric strength profiles), (2) the computed relative stress magnitude (phi) values, and (3) a vertical principal stress assumed equal to the lithostat. Two end-member possibilities were examined to explain the observed slip in these less than optimally oriented fault planes. First, the frictional coefficient was held constant on all faults, hydrostatic pore pressure was assumed regionally, and the fault zone pore pressure was determined. Since pore pressure is a measurable quantity with real limits in the crust (P0 {\textless} S3), this end-member case was used to determine which of the geometrically possible slip planes were frictionally likely slip planes. Alternately, pore pressure was fixed at hydrostatic everywhere, and the required relative lowered frictional coefficient of the fault zone was computed. Slip in 23 of the 25 geometrically compatible earthquakes was determined to also be frictionally likely in response to an approximately horizontal and vertical regional stress field derived from plate-driving forces whose magnitudes are constrained by the frictional strength of optimally oriented faults (assuming hydrostatic pore pressure regionally). The conditions for slip on these 23 relatively “well-oriented” earthquake faults were determined relative to this regional crustal strength model and require only moderate increases in pore pressure (between about 0.4-0.8 of lithostatic, hydrostatic is about 0.37 of lithostatic) or, alternately, moderate lowering ({\textless}50\%) of the frictional coefficient on the faults which slipped. Superlithostatic pore pressures are not required. Focal mechanisms for the two other earthquakes with slip vectors geometrically consistent with the regional stress field, however, did require pore pressures far exceeding the least principal stress (or extremely low coefficients of friction). These events may reflect either local stress rotations undetected with current sampling or poorly constrained focal mechanisms. The analysis also confirmed a roughly north to south contrast in stress regime between the central eastern United States and southeastern Canada previously inferred from a contrast in focal mechanisms between the two areas: most central eastern United States earthquakes occur in response to a strike-slip stress regime, whereas the southeastern Canadian events require a thrust faulting stress regime. This contrast in stress regime, with a constant maximum horizontal stress orientation determined by far-field plate-driving forces, requires a systematic lateral variation in relative stress magnitudes. Superposition of stresses due to simple flexural models of glacial rebound stresses are of the correct sense to explain the observed lateral variation, but maximum computed rebound-related stress magnitude changes are quite small (about 10 MPa) and do not appear large enough to account for the stress regime change if commonly assumed stress magnitudes determined from frictional strength apply to the crust at seismogenic depths.},

The inclusion of solvent molecules in the crystal favors one-dimensional polymers built on the M(CN)4 anions and the solvent.

	abstract = {An insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategy was introduced into the summer rainfall cropping areas of eastern Australia in the 1983/84 season. The aims of this IRM strategy were to manage pyrethroid and endosulfan resistance problems in Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner), formerly Heliothis armigera (Hubner), and to avoid any possible future problems with organophosphate or carbamate resistance. An alternation strategy was adopted which was based on the rotation of unrelated chemical groups on a per generation basis, along with a strong recommendation for the use of ovicidal mixtures. These chemical countermeasures were then incorporated into an acceptable integrated pest management (IPM) programme. The voluntary restrictions were applied to all crops susceptible to H. armigera. They were even applied to other co-incident pest species on these hosts, such as sorghum midge Contarinia sorghicola (Coquillet) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), as it was shown that pyrethroids applied to flowering sorghum for midge control caused selective mortality of co-incident H. armigera larvae and resulted in differential selection for resistance. The demonstration of the independence of the endosulfan and pyrethroid resistance mechanisms vindicated the sequential use of these two groups in Stages I and II of the IRM strategy, respectively. The impact of the IRM strategy on pyrethroid and endosulfan resistance was followed using a monitoring technique based on discriminating dose testing of larvae reared from field collected eggs. This proved to be a very sensitive technique which facilitated fine tuning of the strategy's guidelines as and when necessary, e.g. the reduction of the pyrethroid window from 42 to 35 days from the 1989/90 season onwards. Pyrethroids selected for resistance in both moths and larvae and this was manifested within the Stage II window and in the early Stage III period, respectively. The two main factors influencing the frequency of pyrethroid resistance were dilution by susceptibles immigrating from the refugia and pyrethroid selection pressure. However, as the refugia became increasingly contaminated their effectiveness as a dilution source declined, resulting in gradually increasing pyrethroid resistance levels in all areas over time. This highlights the importance of maintaining an effectively large susceptible gene pool for sustained dilution of resistance as was shown in the case of self regulated resistance management in the polyphagous, highly mobile sibling species Helicoverpa punctigera (Wallengren). Inadequate cultivation of post-harvest fields harbouring overwintering pupae resulted in the carry over of large numbers of resistant pupae. The strategy was shown to be a successful delaying tactic for pyrethroid resistance. The possible reasons for the much more successful management of endosulfan resistance are discussed. The Via tolerance curve analysis of Fl data indicated an abrupt change in the relative importance of field pyrethroid resistance mechanisms following the introduction of the IRM strategy. The strategy favoured the selection of the more amenable oxidative resistance mechanism over the intractable nerve insensitivity resistance mechanism which was also clearly demonstrated by the dual insecticide +/- synergist discriminating dose technique. Two possibly complementary explanations are put forward for this; differential genetic dominance, and/or selection in more than one life stage. The Beeman-Nanis analysis was unsuccessful in identifying the relative importance of the field resistance genes due to lack of full genetic dominance. Moths expressed pyrethroid resistance to both direct (eye test) and indirect (tarsal plate test) exposure without hypo-irritability. Selection of adults in the field resulted in dispersal of resistant moths from sprayed to nearby unsprayed cotton. The phenotypic expression of pyrethroid resistance in moths declined with age. This resulted in poor correlation of adult resistance (determined from pheromone trapped males) and resistance in field collected eggs. Oxidative metabolic detoxification was shown to be the major pyrethroid resistance mechanism in moths as well as larvae. Both pyrethroid and endosulfan resistant H. armigera larvae were shown to have marginally longer development times. However, these were not manifested as significant biological deficits in laboratory and field competition studies on pyrethroid resistant larvae and prepupae (endosulfan not studied). The absence of back selection against pyrethroid resistant H. arinigera in the unsprayed refugia, due to the lack of any selective disadvantage in the immature stages (adults not studied), helps explain the gradually deteriorating pyrethroid resistance situation.There was no evidence of selection of fitness modifiers to overcome the slower development of either pyrethroid or endosulfan resistant larvae. The demonstration that the strategy has favoured selection of the more amenable oxidative resistance mechanism, led to the study of possible chemical countermeasures, such as synergists and resistance breaking pyrethroids. The methylenedioxyphenyl and acetylenic compounds were the most effective synergists with moderate activity from some organophosphate compounds. All the other compounds tested were either ineffective or only marginally effective, including most organophosphates tested, pyrethroid analogues, N-alkyls, esterase and glutathione transferase inhibitors, various nitrogen heterocycles, juvenile hormone and analogues, formamidines, organochlorines, anti-oxidants, and kojic acid. The most promising synergists indicated for further evaluation were synthetic analogues of piperonyl butoxide (Pbo), phosmet, propargite and possibly also fenthion, phosalone, azinphos-ethyl, pyrazophos and kinoprene. Studies with various solvents indicated that the mode of action of Pbo and the other synergists in this study, is principally true biochemical inhibition and not quasi-synergism (improved penetration). Studies on Pbo indicated that a set rate of Pbo should be used, irrespective of the activity of the accompanying pyrethroid, residual activity of Pbo is poor but that this could be partially overcome by increasing the rate, straight Pbo applied onto a weathered pyrethroid deposit could restore control but only temporarily and would probably be of little practical field use and that, no difference in residual activity could be found between the four Pbo formulations tested. In order to preserve the long-term effectiveness of Pbo as a pyrethroid synergist within the Australian IRM strategy, an optimal use strategy (based on synergist rotation within the present insecticide rotation scheme) is discussed. The structural requirements for designing a resistance breaking pyrethroid to overcome oxidative metabolic pyrethroid resistance in H. armigera were studied. Changes from the conventional phenoxybenzyl alcohol moiety could overcome most, if not all, resistance. Simple benzyl alcohols were the most effective followed by cyclopentenolones and a methylated biphenyl alcohol. Incorporation of synergophore groupings (methylenedioxyphenyl and acetylenic) were fully effective in breaking resistance. Changes from the conventional central ester bond to an ether and reversion to an unsubstituted alpha carbon analogue, both lowered resistance. Some evidence was found to indicate that Pbo could be acting both as a classical monooxygenase inhibitor and a preferential penetration synergist in resistant larvae. Fully or partially resolved isomers were clearly much more toxic on resistant strains, indicating a possible blocking effect of the inactive isomers. A simple benzyl resistance breaking pyrethroid (Series Two) was shown to be equally effective on both adult and larval H. armigera, giving similar results to a pyrethroid/Pbo mix. The ideal requirements for a resistance breaking pyrethroid are discussed as well as factors acting against their possible commercialization.},

	abstract = {Various models have been proposed to predict changes in scalar concentrations and surface fluxes following an abrupt change in surface conditions. In most cases the boundary conditions used to describe the surface represent limiting cases such as a step change in either concentration, flux or surface resistance. Three main conclusions emerge from a review of experimental results published thus far. Firstly, a dry-to-wet transition can be treated as a step change in concentration, after which the difference between the downwind and upwind surface fluxes show a power-law dependence on distance from the leading edge with an exponent of the order of -1/6. Secondly, wet-to-dry transitions should be treated as resulting in a step change in flux. This has not always been appreciated. Thirdly, a dry-to-moist (e.g. irrigated) transition is shown to resemble more closely a step change in flux than a step change in surface resistance. This can only be explained if stomatal resistance varies in conjunction with downwind changes in saturation deficit. We propose a simple analytical model to describe the streamwise change in surface resistance in the limit of a step change in flux. A scarcity of published data suitable for validation of this model has led us to undertake a new experimental investigation. This experiment is the subject of a companion paper.},

	abstract = {Analysis of the DNA sequences of new members of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MEL1-MEL10 gene family showed high homology between the members. The MEL gene family, alpha-galactosidase-coding sequences, have diverged into two groups; one consisting of MEL1 and MEL2 and the other of MEL3-MEL10. In two S. cerevisiae strains containing five or seven MEL genes each, all the genes are nearly identical, suggesting very rapid distribution of the gene to separate chromosomes. The sequence homology and the abrupt change to sequence heterogeneity at the centromere-proximal 3' end of the MEL genes suggest that the distribution of the genes to new chromosomal locations has occurred partly by reciprocal recombination at solo delta sequences. We identified a new open reading frame sufficient to code for a 554 amino acid long protein of unknown function. The new open reading frame (Accession number Z37509) is located in the 3' non-coding region of MEL3-MEL10 genes in opposite orientation to the MEL genes (Accession numbers Z37508, Z37510, Z37511). Northern analysis of total RNA showed no hybridization to a homologous probe, suggesting that the gene is not expressed efficiently if at all.},

	abstract = {Assimilation experiments were conducted using the first 12 months of TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) altimeter measurements in a multilayered quasigeostrophic model of the North Atlantic between 20 degrees N and 60 degrees N. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using T/P data to control a basin-scale circulation model by means of an assimilation procedure. Moreover, they allow us to recreate the four-dimensional behavior of the North Atlantic Ocean during the year October 1992 - September 1993 and to improve our knowledge and understanding of such circulation patterns. For this study we used a four-layer quasigeostrophic model of high horizontal resolution (1/6 degrees in latitude and longitude). The assimilation procedure used is an along-track, sequential, nudging technique. The evolution of the model general circulation is described and analyzed from a deterministic and statistical point of view, with special emphasis on the Gulf Stream area. The gross features of the North Atlantic circulation in terms of mean transport and circulation are reproduced, such as the path, penetration and recirculation of the Gulf Stream, and its meandering throughout the eastern basin. The North Atlantic Drift is, however, noticeably underestimated. A northern meander of the north wall of the Gulf Stream above the New England Seamount Chain is present for most of the year, while, just downstream, the southers part of the jet is subject to a 100-km southeastward deflection. The Azores current is shown to remain stable and to shift southward with time from the beginning of December 1992 to the end of April 1993, the amplitude of the shift being about 2 degrees. The computation of the mean latitude of the Gulf Stream as a function of time shows an abrupt Shift from a northern position to a southern position in January, and a reverse shift, from a southern position to a northern position, in July. Finally, some issues ape addressed concerning the comparison of assimilation experiments using T/P data and Geosat data. The first results show that the T/P simulations are more energetic than the Geosat simulations, especially east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, for every wavelength from 50 km to 500 km. This property is also verified in the deep ocean. The predicted abyssal circulation is indeed more energetic in the T/P case, which is more in accordance with what we know of the real ocean. Moreover, the good T/P altimeter coverage near the coasts greatly improves the model eddy kinetic energy levels in these areas, especially east of 25 degrees W.},

The presence of a postoperative restrictive pattern of diastolic filling is a strong predictor of 3-month mortality and makes the medical treatment difficult. Caution must be taken to perform endoventriculoplasty in patients who are severely ill, especially those recently affected by myocardial infarction, When the clinical conditions dictate the operation, a nonenthusiastic volume reduction seems to be a prudent option.},

We construct composite slant stacks for a pair of reversed shots recorded along the axis of the Merrimack Synclinorium in southwest Maine and invert picks for bounds on averaged one-dimensional slowness-depth structure. Extremal bounds on total crustal thickness derived from shot point 12 are 40 to 43 km. Average crustal velocities for individual slowness models corresponding to the extremal depths range from 6.5 to 6.6 km/sec. Predicted normal-incidence two-way travel times for the Moho lie between 12.2 and 13.2 sec. The utility of one-dimensional inversion of tau(p) data is largely in estimating the maximum resolving power of the data set; this is information that forward modeling approaches do not provide. Comparisons of slant stacks of reversed shot gathers with intercept times predicted for a two-dimensional model derived by ray tracing highlight some of the pitfalls associated with interpretation of tau(p) data in terms of one-dimensional structure. In some cases, the principal arrival may become multi-valued, resulting in misidentification of phases and compounding biases in estimates of average crustal parameters. Slant stacks can be highly useful, however, in refining two-dimensional models derived from travel times because of the sensitivity of ray parameters to dip and lateral velocity gradients. We use slant stacks in conjunction with the original shot gathers to refine our estimate of the configuration of the Moho beneath southwest Maine. Our final model shows a step in the Moho that is consistent with variations in normal two-way travel times inferred from analysis of postcritical fan shots. This abrupt change in crustal thickness may mark the northeast extent of significant underthrusting of Avalon crust beneath Medial New England basement during the Acadian Orogeny. The preservation of offsets in Moho that were formed during Paleozoic compression is consistent with the limited amount of rifting experienced by this portion of the orogen during the opening of the Atlantic.},

The inflation findings-though not the recession findings-support the arguments of Karen Remmer and Samuel Huntington that the processes affecting democratization were very different in the 1980s than in earlier eras.

The analyses consistently demonstrate a strong link between autocratization and dispute initiation, and a less robust relationship between autocratization and war initiation. New autocratic regimes and dispute targets are positively related, though this link is contingent upon the operationalization of the dependent variable. Autocratization and war target are negatively related when the dependent variable is non-revisionism. Lastly, the analyses consistently suggest that new democracies are not more dispute or war prone, either as initiator or target.},

	abstract = {Identification of the cardiac borders is a basic goal in the analysis of echocardiographic images. This is a requirement for various analysis purposes, such as the derivation of quantitative parameters, for wall motion analysis and for the creation of three-dimensional reconstructions. Border identification is usually accomplished by first identifying a set of generic edge points, then extracting the border of interest from the edge map. A variety of edge detection algorithms have been reported in the literature. However, the most commonly used methods are all based on the same underlying tissue discriminant, namely, the widely differing backscatter levels of the different types of tissue that form the cardiac borders, in particular, blood and myocardium. We have implemented a new method of edge detection based on an entirely different ultrasonic tissue characteristic - that of attenuation, the rate at which the tissue absorbs ultrasonic energy. This characteristic also differs widely between blood and myocardium, and therefore provides an alternative means of discriminating between these two types of tissue. The method searches for the abrupt change in attenuation rare that characteristically occurs at the blood/myocardium interface. At each point in the image, the average attenuation rates of the portions of tissue radially preceding and radially following the point are determined by least-squares regression. If one of these attenuation rates is sufficiently dose to that of blood, and the other is sufficiently close to that of myocardium, then the point is flagged as an edge point. This paper describes how this method is implemented in software, and presents the results of applying the method to a library of sample images.},

In this paper, we demonstrate a novel method for detection of biological membranes using the low coherence interferometry. In the experiment, rat mesentery was used as the sample of biological membranes, and the refractive index of the mesentery was measured precisely as the sample temperature was changed. Abrupt change in both the index and transmission of the mesentery can be found in the temperature range of 38 degrees C to 42 degrees C, which is good agreement with the temperature range for the gel-to-liquid phase transition of the artificial (liposomal) membrane. Our method does not require any treatments, including fragmentation and centrifugation, for extraction of phospholipid bilayers from biological membranes. It, therefore, is a useful method for in vivo measurement and analysis of the membrane functions.},

	abstract = {We conducted field surveys of rocky intertidal communities at 18 sites distributed between 29degrees S and 36degrees S on the coast of central Chile in order to document broad patterns of functional and trophic group abundance and evaluate their association with oceanographic features. Results showed that the main sessile components of the landscape throughout the region were kelps (16 \%) and crustose algae (48 \%) in the low intertidal zone, while mussels beds (30 \%) and corticated algae (32 \%) dominated the mid-intertidal zone. Geographic trends in abundance across the entire region varied from no clear regional patterns for some groups (e.g. barnacles), to smooth gradients increasing or decreasing toward higher latitudes for others (kelps and ephemeral algae) and to an abrupt switch from dominant to scarce northward of 32degrees S in 1 group (mussels). Significant among-site negative correlations were detected between the abundances of most algal functional groups and between mussels and barnacles. Herbivore density was negatively correlated with kelp and corticated algal cover, and positively correlated with crustose algal abundance. These correlations reinforce the notion that local biological interactions can partially account for the among-site variability in functional group abundance. We assessed the influence of mesoscale oceanographic features through satellite image analyses, by classifying the study sites as either strongly or weakly influenced by coastal upwelling. At sites strongly influenced by upwelling, we found significantly higher cover of kelps in the low intertidal zone and of corticated algae in the mid-intertidal zone. Cover of ephemeral algae in the mid-intertidal zone was significantly lower at sites strongly affected by upwelling. Contrary to predictions of bottom-up community regulation models, we found no significant differences in abundance of sessile filter feeders (mussels or barnacles), herbivores or carnivores. A significant proportion of the regional variation in abundance in some of the most abundant functional groups within each tidal level was associated with the latitudinal gradient in annual mean sea surface temperature (SST). We detected a significant correlation between SST and the abundance of kelps and crustose algae in the low intertidal zone, and mussels and ephemeral algae in the mid-intertidal zone. The abrupt change in the abundance of mussels in the mid-intertidal zone at about 32degrees S may indicate a similarly abrupt change in biological or environmental conditions. Lack of significant correlation between the abundance of mussels and other functional groups suggests that biological interactions may not be responsible for this geographic discontinuity. We suggest that oceanography may be largely involved in the geographic variability detected in patterns of community structure. Recent remote sensing studies documenting oceanographic discontinuities around the 32degrees S zone support our suggestion. Our results highlight the need for further experimental and oceanographic studies in areas where strong biophysical gradients are observed. Such areas may well reflect the existence of steep oceanographic gradients sensitive to large-scale environmental forcing.},

	abstract = {The heating up of dental composites by laser will produce acoustic emissions (AEs) that may be related to fracture mechanisms in the composites. It has been proved that the mechanical properties of dental composites are affected by storage in food simulating liquids, i.e. 75\% ethanol, which has a solubility parameter approximating to that of bisphenol glycidyl dimethacrylate (BisGMA) resin. A new method was innovated to evaluate the laser-induced AEs in dental composites aged by 75\% ethanol solution. Model systems (50/50 BisGMA/TEGDMA resin filled with 0\% and 75 wt.\% 5-10 mu m silanized BaSiO6) as well as three commercial composites (Marathon One, Z100 and Herculite XRV) were used in this study. Nine samples acting as the control group were tested to establish the correlation of AEs to laser power. The effect of ageing by immersion in 75\% ethanol on AEs and diametral tensile strength (DTS) was then evaluated. A quasi-continuous wave CO2 laser was used to heat up the composites. AEs of frequency 100-200 kHz were collected, filtered, recorded and processed using a 4610 Smart Acoustic Monitor. Burst patterns, which formally were assumed to be correlated to fracture mechanisms, were also identified from the data obtained at laser power greater than or equal to 5 W for commercial composites and greater than or equal to 4 W for model systems. Higher laser powers cause the AE to increase for all composites except unfilled model resin. AEs as a function of power for all aged systems were flat ({\textless} 100 events) below 4 W. Emissions then rose sharply to {\textgreater} 1000 events at 7.1 W. Statistically significant differences were found between the AEs obtained at 5 W (commercial composites) and those at 4.3 W (model systems) for material systems and storage times. Marathon One was less affected by the laser and an abrupt change in AE was found between days 0 and 7 of storage for all commercial composites. The AE value from the unfilled model resin was found to be significantly different from that of the model composites. However, they showed an increase in AEs with length of storage time, which was inversely associated with the decreased tendency of their immersed DTS values. Laser-induced AEs may be a valuable adjunct to conventional mechanical testing.},

	abstract = {This article considers an important aspect of the general sequential analysis problem where a process is in control up to some unknown point i = v - 1, after which the distribution from which the observations are generated changes. An extensive sequential analytic literature assumes that the change in distribution is abrupt, for example, from N(0, 1) to N(mu, 1). There is also an extensive literature that deals with a gradual change in the case where the decision (whether or not a change has occurred) is based on a fixed set of observations, rather than an ongoing process of decision making every time a new observation is obtained. However, there is virtually no literature on the practical case of sequentially detecting a gradual change in distribution (visualize a machine deteriorating gradually). This article considers solutions to this problem. As a first approximation, the gradual change problem can be modeled as a change from a fixed distribution to a-model of simple linear regression with respect to time (i.e., there is an abrupt change of slope, from a 0 to a nonzero slope). We study an extension of this case to a general context of sequential detection of a change in the slope of a simple linear regression. The residuals are assumed to be normally distributed. We consider both the case in which the baseline parameters are known and the case in which they are not. Finally, as an application, we monitor for an increase in the rate of global warming.},

Several research groups are investigating possible reasons for this decline. One part of this study addresses whether the decline is the result of some recent regime change in the ecosystem, and more generally whether one or more regime changes have occurred since regular sampling of fish, zooplankton and mysids shrimps began in 1967. There are many statistical methods of analysis that have been proposed to detect regime changes. These are reviewed, but it is noted that none of them is immediately suitable for analysing the basic data collected from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which consists of counts from trawl hauls and other sampling gears used in the field. Two new methods are therefore proposed for this type of data, which is commonly collected. One method searches for times when the mean level and trend in the abundance of an organism changed, assuming that in the absence of a regime change the abundances will exhibit a linear trend with time. The other method assumes that in the absence of a regime change the abundances will exhibit a polynomial trend in time, and searches for times when the mean level changed significantly. Both methods rely on bootstrap resampling of the data for assessing the significance of apparent regime changes. Simulation studies to verify the properties of the proposed analyses are described, and also some examples of the results of the analyses on the Sacramento-San Joaquin data.},

	abstract = {Stable isotopes in water have been measured along a very high accumulation ice core from Law Dome on the east Antarctic coast. These enable a detailed comparison of the isotopic records over sixty years (1934-1992) with local (Antarctic station data) and remote meteorological observations (atmospheric reanalyses and sea-surface temperature estimates) on a seasonal to inter-annual time scale. Using both observations and isotopic atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) results, we quantify the relationships between stable isotopes (delta(18)O, deltaD and deuterium excess; d = deltaD -8 x delta(18)O) with site and source temperature at seasonal and decadal time scales, showing the large imprint of source conditions on Law Dome isotopes. These calibrations provide new insights for the quantitative interpretation of temporal isotopic fluctuations from coastal Antarctic ice cores. An abrupt change in the local meridional atmospheric circulation is clearly identified from Law Dome deuterium excess during the 1970s and analysed using GCM simulations.},

	abstract = {Forest owners' values and the ownership structure of forest are changing continuously. One probable consequence of the current trends in Finland is that the significance of forest-related income will decrease, which may have a significant impact on the round wood supply. This study developed and demonstrated a new method, which allows policy makers to make forecasts on the future timber supply. The method is based on the assumed temporal changes in the distributions of the importance of different forest management goals. The distributions are converted into utility functions, generated separately for each forest holding. The utility functions are maximised, using heuristics, to obtain the optimal forest management plans for the holdings. The regional cutting budget is calculated by summing the removals of the optimal treatment schedules of stands over the whole area. The method was demonstrated by assuming four different scenarios for the forest management goals, in which the importance of net income from realised cuttings decreased by 0\%, 25\%, 50\% or 100\% in 60 years. The decrease was compensated for by an increased importance of the other goals, namely economic security, recreation, and nature values. The calculations were made with three different methods. Methods 1 and 2 derived the optimal plans directly for the whole 60-year period while Method 3 developed three consecutive 20-year plans. Method 2 assumed that the holding is sold or inherited once in 20 years with an abrupt change in the management goals. In Methods 1 and 3 the goals changed only gradually. The results were logical, indicating that the more the importance of net income decreases the lower the future timber supply will be. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Here the 1976-77 climate regime shift that was accompanied by a remarkable change in the lead-lag relationships between Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) and El Ni (n) over tildeo evolution is shown. After the 1976-77 regime shift, a correlation analysis suggests that southern Indian Ocean SSTs observed during late boreal winter are a key precursor in predicting El Ni (n) over tildeo evolution as the traditional oceanic heat content anomalies in the equatorial Pacific or zonal wind anomalies over the equatorial western Pacific. The possible physical mechanisms underlying this highly significant statistical relationship are discussed. After the 1976-77 regime shift, southern Indian Ocean SST anomalies produced by Mascarene high pulses during boreal winter trigger coupled air-sea processes in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean during the following seasons. This produces a persistent remote forcing on the Pacific climate system, promoting wind anomalies over the western equatorial Pacific and modulating the regional Hadley cell in the southwest Pacific. These modulations, in turn, excite Rossby waves, which produce quasi-stationary circulation anomalies in the extratropical South Pacific, responsible for the development of the southern branch of the `' horseshoe `' El Nino pattern. The change of the background SST state that occurred in the late 1970s over the Indian Ocean may also explain why ENSO evolution is different before and after the 1976-77 regime shift. These results shed some light on the possible influence of global warming or decadal fluctuations on El Nino evolution through changes in teleconnection patterns between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.},

While the resonance mode of major longitudinal vibration shifted in an indentation and elasticity dependent manner, a disappearance of the rotational vibration upon contact resulted in abrupt change in resonance frequency which was used to signal touch detection.

	abstract = {We present a deconvolution technique based on a fast-Fourier-transform (FFT) algorithm. With the new technique, we can deconvolve “noisy” pressure and rate data from drawdown and buildup tests dominated by wellbore storage. The wellbore-storage coefficient can be variable in the general case. In cases with no rate measurements, we use a “blind” deconvolution method to restore the pressure response free of wellbore-storage effects. Our technique detects the afterflow/unloading rate function with Fourier analysis of the observed pressure data. The technique can unveil the early-time behavior of a reservoir system masked by wellbore-storage effects, and it thus provides a powerful tool to improve pressure-transient-test interpretation. It has the advantages of suppressing the noise in the measured data, handling the problem of variable wellbore storage, and deconvolving the pressure data without rate measurement. We demonstrate the applicability of the method with a variety of synthetic and actual field cases for both oil and gas wells. Some of the actual cases include measured sandface rates (which we use only for reference purposes), and others do not. Although this paper is focused on deconvolution of pressure-transient-test data during a specific drawdown/buildup period corresponding to an abrupt change of surface flow rate, the deconvolution method itself is very general and can be extended readily to interpret multirate test data.},

Based on this physical consideration, we propose a new method termed as Season-reliant Empirical Orthogonal Function (S-EOF) analysis to detect major modes of climate variability. The S-EOF analysis of Indo-Pacific SST during the past 54 years reveals two statistically significant leading modes, which are not obtainable by using conventional EOF analysis. These modes represent the Indo-Pacific Low-Frequency (LF) and Quasi-Biennial (QB) modes associated ENSO, and reveal the fundamental differences between the LF and QB modes in their seasonal evolution, fractional variance structure, and interdecadal variation and trend. The interdecadal variability is coupled with the LF mode, suggesting that decadal-interdecadal SST variation is primarily represented by the ENSO-like interdecadal regime shift in the late 1970s. A warming trend is mingled with the QB mode, accounting for a large portion of the local SST variability in the Maritime Continent-western Pacific horseshoe region.},

GPRs deliver so-called Bscan data which are, roughly, vertical slice images of the ground. However, due to the high dielectric permittivity contrast at the air-ground interface, a strong response is recorded at early time by GPRs. This response is the main component of the so-called clutter noise and it blurs the responses of landmines buried at shallow depths. The landmine detection task is therefore quite difficult. This paper proposes a new method for automated detection and localization of buried objects from Bscan records. A support vector machine algorithm for online abrupt change detection is implemented and proves to be efficient in detecting buried landmines from Bscan data. The proposed procedure performance is evaluated using simulated and real data.},

An index of local climate (1960-2005), and data from commercial fishery catches (1960-2004) and from small-mesh trawl surveys (1972-2005) are used to assess the impacts of these climate events in the Subarctic Gulf of Alaska. Non-linear regression showed that survey catch composition strongly responded to local climate at lags of 2 and 4 years, providing evidence of rapid ecological response to climate change in the system. A sequential regime shift detection method identified rapid change in local climate, and in survey and commercial catches following the well-documented regime shift to a positive state of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in 1976/1977. However, the analysis failed to detect the 1998/1999 regime shift in local climate, or in survey or commercial catches. This result is consistent with the view that the 1998/1999 climate regime shift did not represent a reversion to a negative PDO state. Local temperature increased and local sea level pressure decreased in the Gulf of Alaska during the years 2001-2005, consistent with anthropogenic warming and recent spatial reorganization in Arctic climate. There was no evidence of community reorganization following this climate event. Further observation will be required to evaluate the persistence of this new climate pattern, and the nature of community reaction to it. (c) 2006 International Council forthe Exploration ofthe Sea.

Our approach included: 1) fine-tuning of the charge-transfer (CT) distance by using the extended set of Au-deposited hydroxyl-terminated alkanethiol SAMs [-S-(CH2)(n)-OH] of variable thickness (n=2, 3, 4, 6, 11); 2) application of a high-pressure (up to 150MPa) kinetic strategy toward the representative Au/SAM/CytC assemblies (n=3, 4, 6); 3) complementary electrochemical and microcalorimetric studies on the impact of some stabilizing and denaturing additives. We report for the first time a mechanistic changeover detected for “free” CytC by three independent kinetic methods, manifested through 1) the abrupt change in the dependence of the shape of the electron exchange standard rate constant (k(o)) versus the SAM thickness (resulting in a variation of estimated actual CT range within ca. 15 to 25 angstrom including ca. 11 angstrom of an “effective” heme-to-omega-hydroxyl distance). The corresponding values of the electronic coupling matrix element vary within the range from ca. 3 to 0.02 cm(-1); 2) the change in activation volume from +6.7 (n=3), to approximate to 0 (n=4), and -5.5 (n=6) cm(3) mol(-1) (disclosing at n=3 a direct pressure effect on the protein's internal viscosity); 3) a “full” Kramers-type viscosity dependence for k(o) at n=2 and 3 (demonstrating control of an intraglobular friction through the external dynamic properties), and its gradual transformation to the viscosity independent (nonadiabatic) regime at n=6 and 11. Multilateral cross-testing of “free” CytC in a native-like, glucose-stabilized and urea-destabilized (molten-globule-like) states revealed novel intrinsic links between local/global structural and functional characteristics. Importantly, our results on the high-pressure and solution-viscosity effects, together with matching literature data, strongly support the concept of “dynamic slaving”, which implies that fluctuations involving “small” solution components control the proteins' intrinsic dynamics and function in a highly cooperative manner as far as CT processes under adiabatic conditions are concerned.},

	abstract = {A novel model for the coupling between ventricular repolarisation and heart rate (QT/RR) is presented. It is based upon a transfer function (TRF) formalism that describes the static and dynamic properties of this coupling, i.e., the behaviour after a sudden change in heart rate. Different TRF models were analysed by comparing their capability to describe experimental data collected from 19 healthy volunteers using several RR stimulation protocols: (i) rest with deep breathing at 0.1 Hz; (ii) tilt with controlled breathing at 0.1 and 0.33 Hz; and (iii) cycling. A search for the best TRF led to unambiguous identification of a three-parameter model as the most suitable descriptor of QT/RR coupling. Compared with established static models (linear or power-law), our model predictions are substantially closer to the experimental results, with errors similar to 50\% smaller. The shape of the frequency and step responses of the TRF presented is essentially the same for all subjects and protocols. Moreover, each TRF may be uniquely identified by three parameters obtained from the step response, which are believed to be of physiological relevance: (i) gain for slow RR variability; (ii) gain for fast RR variability; and (iii) time during which QT attains 90\% of its steady-state value. The TRF successfully describes the behaviour of the RR control following an abrupt change in RR interval, and its parameters may offer a tool for detecting pharmacologically induced changes, particularly those leading to increased arrhythmogenic risk.},

Geochemical characteristics of the high-Ba-Sr I-type granite suggest that it may have been generated from the thickened lower crust by partial melting with primary residues of amphibole and garnet. Gradual increase of negative Eu anomaly and Sr content variations reflect progressive shallowing of the source regions of these granites from the early to late stage. New Ar-40/Ar-39 plateau ages of the early-stage Wuzhangshan granite (156.0 +/- 1.1 Ma, amphibole) and middle-stage Heyu granite (131.8 +/- 0.7 Ma, biotite) are indistinguishable from their SHRIMP U-Pb ages previous published, indicating a rapid uplift and erosion in this region. The representative anorogenic A-type granite, Taishanmiao pluton, was emplaced at similar to 115 Ma. The evolution of the granites in this region reveals a tectonic regime change from post-collisional to anorogenic between similar to 160 Ma and similar to 115 Ma. The genesis of the early- and middle-stage I-type granites could be linked to delamination of subducted lithosphere of the Qinling orogenic belt, while the late-stage A-type granites represent the onset of extension and the end of orogenic process. In fact, along the Qinling -Dabic-Sulu belt, the Mesozoic granitoids in western Henan, Dabieshan and Jiaodong regions are comparable on the basis of these temporal evolutionary stages and their initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, which may suggest a similar geodynamic process related to the collision between the North China and Yangtze cratons.},

	abstract = {Recently, wide band measurements of the electric field near a lightning flash have been obtained by a balloon- borne electric field sonde or Esonde. This paper develops new techniques for analyzing lightning- associated charge transport in a thundercloud by using both the Esonde data and simultaneous Lightning Mapping Array ( LMA) measurements of VHF pulses emitted during lightning breakdown processes. Innovations in this paper include the following: ( 1) A filtering procedure is developed to separate the background field associated with instrument rotation and cloud charging processes from the lightning- induced electric field change. Because of the abrupt change in the signal caused by lightning, standard filtering techniques do not apply. A new mathematical procedure is developed to estimate the background electric field that would have existed if the lightning had not occurred. The estimated background field is subtracted from the measured field to obtain the lightning- induced field change. ( 2) Techniques are developed to estimate the charge transport due to lightning. At any instant of time during a cloud- to-ground ( CG) flash, we estimate the charge transport by a monopole. During an intracloud ( IC) flash, we estimate the charge transport by a dipole. Since the location of the monopole and dipole changes with time, they are referred to as a dynamic monopole and a dynamic dipole. The following physical constraints are used to achieve a unique fit: charge conservation during an IC flash, separation ( distance between the CG monopole charge center and the ground and separation between IC dipole charge centers both exceed a minimum threshold), location ( charge is placed on lightning channel), and likelihood ( after a statistical analysis based on instrument uncertainty, highly unlikely charge locations are excluded). To implement the constraint that the charge is located on the lightning channel, we develop a mathematical object called the `' pulse graph.” Vertices in the graph are pulse locations obtained from the Lightning Mapping Array. Edges in the graph ( that is, the pairs of vertices which are connected by line segments) are obtained by joining, in a systematic way, neighboring vertices. One CG and two IC flashes observed on 18 August 2004 near Langmuir Laboratory are analyzed. In the CG flash, initial strokes drained 12 C charge from an altitude of 5 km, while an intermediate stroke discharged 12 C from a higher charge center at 8 km. For the IC flashes, the current flow lagged behind the channel formation by time intervals on the order of 0.1 s, roughly the same time delay observed for lightning optical signals detected by NASA's Lightning Imaging Sensor.},

Our method is based on the statistical properties of the estimated gradient of the variable. The local gradient is first interpolated by kriging. Then we test whether the estimated local gradient exceeds some critical threshold computed under the null hypothesis of a constant mean. The locations where the local test is rejected define the potential ZACs, which are then tested globally. Using this method, we analysed soil data from an agricultural field. The analysis of the main soil components of the ploughed layer (clay, silt and sand particles and calcium carbonate content) reveals the structural variations in the field, linked to boundaries between soil types. Its application to non-permanent variables (soil water and mineral nitrogen content of the soil profile to 120 cm taken at several dates) shows that water content has the same ZACs for all dates, whereas mineral nitrogen has none.},

	abstract = {Long-term ecosystem changes, such as regime shifts, have occurred in several marine ecosystems worldwide. Multivariate statistical methods have been used to detect such changes. A new method known as the sequential t-test algorithm for analysing regime shifts (STARS) is applied to a set of biological state variables as well as environmental and anthropogenic forcing variables in the southern Benguela. The method is able to correct for auto-correlation within time-series by a process known as prewhitening. All variables were tested with and without prewhitening. Shifts that were detected with both methods were termed robust. The STARS method detected shifts in relatively short time-series and identified when these shifts occurred without a priori hypotheses. Shifts were generally well detected at the end of time-series, but further development of the method is needed to enhance its performance for auto-correlated time-series. Since 1950, two major long-term ecosystem changes were identified for the southern Benguela. The first change occurred during the 1960s, caused predominantly by heavy fishing pressure but with some environmental forcing. The second change occurred in the early 2000s, caused mainly by environmental forcing. To strengthen these findings, further analyses should be carried out using different methods.},

	abstract = {Road surface condition is greatly dependent on the surface's friction coefficient. The abrupt change of the coefficient results in variation of wheel slip which likely leads to vehicle instability. Although the vehicle on-board sensors can measure the vehicle's velocities and yaw rate, the measurements, often containing noise and drift, are limited to the surface that the vehicle is engaged. In contrast, an effective observer can be used to estimate the vehicle dynamics for all possible surface conditions. This paper proposes a new observer, called Extended State Observer (ESO) to estimate the three quantities, and more importantly an additional quantity known as system dynamics. With the aid of the ESO, the following three tasks are performed: (1) noise filtering from the measurement data (2) detection and classification of surface condition change, and (3) identification of the road surface. Fuzzy logic was employed to quickly detect the change of road surface condition and further classify the surface; a neural network was employed to help determine the friction coefficient. The dynamic model used in this study can be applied to four-wheel independent drive vehicles. The presented methods were simulated when a vehicle encountered a significant change from a uniform-mu (i.e. uniform friction coefficient) surface to a split-mu surface (i.e. different friction coefficient on each side of the wheels) during cornering.},

The limited potential of workfare is due to the fact that it fails to transcend the constraints of earlier forms of `active' responses to unemployment. Furthermore, it suffers from specific policy-making disadvantages not shared by these responses. The article opens with a survey of relevant academic debates on the subject. It then places workfare in a broader context by identifying its functional reach, as compared to other active policy responses to unemployment such as active labour market policy (ALMP). The third section analyses workfare policies in the United Kingdom, as developed since 1997, by re-examining the British New Deal employment programme. That review demonstrates that workfare policies either depend on their `fit' with the existing policy-making heritage, or that they remain merely symbolic. The article concludes by suggesting that the potential of workfare to effect change in responses to unemployment continues to be of limited significance. In other words, capitalist employment and welfare systems continue to be characterized by incremental adaptation rather than by fundamental regime change as suggested by the critics of workfare.},

The wavelet method estimates the time-instants of the changes in the signal model parameters during the pre-fault condition, after initiation of fault, after circuit-breaker opening and auto-reclosure. Certain kinds of disturbance signals do not show distinct abrupt changes in the signal parameters. In those cases, the standard mother wavelets fail to achieve correct event-specific segmentations. A new adjustment technique to the standard Haar wavelet is proposed in this paper, by introducing 2n adjusting zeros in the Haar wavelet scaling filter, n being a positive integer. This technique is quite effective in segmenting those fault signals into pre- and post-fault segments, and it is an improvement over the standard mother wavelets for this application. This paper presents many practical examples where recorded signals from the power network in South Africa have been used. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Temperature versus time was obtained numerically at the center of the food (banana, “nanicao” variety) using the ID Fourier equation with drying temperatures in the range between approximately 17-65 degrees C and moisture content in the range between 0.01 and 3.43 (dry basis). The solution of the partial differential equation is made with a finite difference method coupled to an optimization technique of Differential Evolution used in inverse method. The mathematical model proposed considered the effects of shrinkage and convective heat transfer at surface of fruit. Parameters of two functions, the first dependent of the moisture content and the second dependent also of the temperature were obtained by inverse method modelling the apparent thermal diffusivity. Such parameters that provide the best least square fit between the experimental and predicted time-temperatures curves are presented in this work. This study demonstrated that a small change in the temperature and moisture content of banana cause an abrupt change in the apparent thermal diffusivity, which decrease with the decreasing of the moisture. Statistical analysis shows the excellent agreement between reported and estimated curves. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Knowing this phase relationship enables us to reduce the magnitudes of age uncertainties for aggradational sections corresponding to glacial terminations IX through III, which we had dated previously by Ar-40/Ar-39 methods. Glacial terminations VIII, VI, and IV precede beyond 95\% confidence the ages predicted by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation maxima.

However, inverse mapping from the damage-induced deflection to the actual damage location and severity is generally complex, particularly for statically indeterminate systems. In this paper, a new load concept, called the positive-bending-inspection-load (PBIL) is proposed to construct a simple inverse mapping from the damage-induced deflection to the actual damage location. A PBIL for an inspection region is defined as a load or a system of loads which guarantees the bending moment to be positive in the inspection region. From the theoretical investigations, it was proven that the damage-induced chord-wise deflection (DI-CD) has the maximum value with the abrupt change in its slope at the damage location under a PBIL. Hence, a novel damage localization method is proposed based on the DI-CD under a PBIL. The procedure may be summarized as: (1) identification of the modal flexibility matrices from acceleration measurements, (2) design for a PBIL for an inspection region of interest in a structure, (3) calculation of the chord-wise deflections for the PBIL using the modal flexibility matrices, and (4) damage localization by finding the location with the maximum DI-CD with die abrupt change in its slope within the inspection region. Procedures from (2)-(4) can be repeated for several inspection regions to cover the whole structure complementarily. Numerical verification studies were carried out on a simply supported beam and a three-span continuous beam model. Experimental verification study was also carried out on a two-span continuous beam structure with a steel box-girder.

	abstract = {A wide range of intractable problems such as polluting emissions, noise. accidents, resource depletion, and inaccessibility of amenities are associated with the current transport regime. Given the slow movement towards a more sustainable mobility system, more radical, systemic innovation - a `transition' - is required. Broadly speaking, this may be achieved via three routes: technological change, modal shift, and reduced travel demand. Drawing on concepts from the transitions literature (e.g., [Geels. F.W.: Technological Transitions and System Innovations: A Co-evolutionary and Socio-Technical Analysis, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2005.]), we conceptualise each of these routes as a bundle of niche activities within an Area of Innovation, deviating to differing degrees from the current mobility `regime'. We present empirical evidence and indications of ongoing development of niches in these three areas within the UK and Sweden, and explore processes of co-evolution, divergence and tension within and between niches. Findings indicate recent market penetration of novel transport technologies, more advanced than modal shift or demand management activities; however, different transport technologies are more successful in each country. We also identify examples of a close relationship between development of radical vehicle/fuel technologies and provision of mobility services; and information technology as a driver in all three areas of innovation. We conclude that future innovation in transport depends on diversity, hybridisation, and co-evolution of niches. Finally, policy implications are discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Background: Past studies in the legume family (Fabaceae) have uncovered several evolutionary trends including differential mutation and diversification rates across varying taxonomic levels. The legume tribe Psoraleeae is shown herein to exemplify these trends at the generic and species levels. This group includes a sizable diversification within North America dated at approximately 6.3 million years ago with skewed species distribution to the most recently derived genus, Pediomelum, suggesting a diversification rate shift. We estimate divergence dates of North American (NAm) Psoraleeae using Bayesian MCMC sampling in BEAST based on eight DNA regions (ITS, waxy, matK, trnD-trnT, trnL-trnF, trnK, trnS-trnG, and rpoB-trnC). We also test the hypothesis of a diversification rate shift within NAm Psoraleeae using topological and temporal methods. We investigate the impact of climate change on diversification in this group by (1) testing the hypothesis that a shift from mesic to xeric habitats acted as a key innovation and (2) investigating diversification rate shifts along geologic time, discussing the impact of Quaternary climate oscillations on diversification. Results: NAm Psoraleeae represents a recent, rapid radiation with several genera originating during the Pleistocene, 1 to 2 million years ago. A shift in diversification rate is supported by both methods with a 2.67-fold increase suggested around 2 million years ago followed by a 8.73-fold decrease 440,000 years ago. The hypothesis that a climate regime shift from mesic to xeric habitats drove increased diversification in affected taxa was not supported. Timing of the diversification rate increase supports the hypothesis that glaciation-induced climate changes during the Quaternary influenced diversification of the group. Nonrandom spatial diversification also exists, with greater species richness in the American Southwest. Conclusion: This study outlines NAm Psoraleeae as a model example of a recent, rapid radiation. Diversification rate shifts in NAm Psoraleeae are not due to current climate regimes as represented by habitat, but instead to past global climate change resulting from Quaternary glaciations. NAm Psoraleeae diversification is a good example of how earthly dynamics including global climate change and topography work together to shape biodiversity.},

Cumulative sums were employed to enhance the detection process. The cumulative sum time histories revealed major turning points at both locations at the time of the 1976-1977 event. At both locations, increases in temperature were indicated, consistent with the phase change in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that took place at that time. The cumulative sums also indicated major turning points at both locations during the 1988-1989 event. A new procedure called the method of expanding means was employed to determine the long-term impact of these events. By comparing means before and after,I given event it is possible to observe the magnitude of the change and to what extent it is sustained. For the 1976-1977 regime shift, temperatures increased rapidly and remained consistently higher, by similar to 1 degrees C for 2-3 yr it Scripps Pier. This increase occurred over a period of approximately 7 months and accounts for more than half of the total warming that has occurred at that location since 1920. At Koko Head, a similar response was observed with a sustained increase of approximately +0.5 degrees C. The oceanic response to the 1988-1989 event was quite different. At Scripps Pier, temperatures before and after this event did not show any tendency to converge to significantly different values out to periods of 2-3 yr. At Koko Head, mean temperatures did converge to slightly different values after 1 yr, with mean values being consistently lower after this event (similar to-0.4 degrees C). It was shown that in some cases changes associated with these events could be identified in the original data, but without the help of cumulative sums, it is usually not possible to make a clear distinction between changes of interest and other sources of variability. Finally, decorrelation time scales for the records at both locations were estimated and found to be on the order of a year, implying spatial scales that are at least synoptic (tens to hundreds of kilometers).},

This type of detector could be made more sensitive if the alignment transition was more abrupt and tunable to be at a `trigger' point for the desired level of concentration of the target molecule. In this study, we investigate the use of `double layer alignment films' to cause a more abrupt change in the bulk surface alignment of a liquid crystal-based sensor of lecithin. We show that the detection level of the percentage of lecithin dissolved in the liquid crystal host can be controlled from greater than 4\% for a conventional single layer alignment film, to less than 0.1\% using the double layer alignment film method. This result verifies an earlier theory, which predicted that a double layer alignment film should provide an abrupt surface alignment transition. The utility of this controllable surface alignment transition as a sensor lies in the anisotropy of liquid crystal materials and the amplification of a detectable signal arising from this anisotropy that results from the alignment of the bulk liquid crystal material in contact with it. For example, the surface alignment change would be expected to cause a large change in capacitance (x2) of a micro-capacitor on an integrated circuit. This work provides a direction for enhancement of liquid crystal-based sensors of other biomolecules, drugs and chemicals.},

	abstract = {With the rapid dependency on the internet for business, and the fast spread of powerful destructive DoS/DDoS attack tools, the detection and thwarting of these attacks is primordial for ISP, enterprises, hosting centers, etc. In this paper, we present the implementation of a new framework, for efficient detection and identification of flooding attacks over high speed links. To accomplish that, we apply multi-channel non-parametric CUSUM (MNP-CUSUM) over the shared counters in the proposed reversible sketch, in order to pinpoint flows with abrupt change via a new approach for sketch inversion. Shared counters are used to minimize the memory requirements and to identify the victim of flooding attacks. We apply our system at various real traces, some traces are provided by France Telecom (FT) within the framework of ANR-RNRT OSCAR project, other traces are collected in FT backbone network, during online experiments for testing and adjusting the proposed detection algorithms in this project. Our analysis results from real internet traffic, and from online implementation over Endace DAG 3.6ET sniffing card, show that our proposed architecture is able to quickly detect various kinds of flooding attacks and to disclose culprit flows with a high level of accuracy.},

	abstract = {Current climate change and overfishing are affecting the productivity and structure of marine ecosystems. This situation is unprecedented for the marine biosphere and it is essential to understand the mechanisms and pathways by which ecosystems respond. We report that climate change and overfishing are likely to be responsible for a rapid restructuring of a highly productive marine ecosystem with effects throughout the pelagos and the benthos. In the mid-1980s, climate change, consequent modifications in the North Sea plankton, and fishing, all reduced North Sea cod recruitment. In this region, production of many benthic species respond positively and immediately to temperature. Analysis of a long-term, spatially extensive biological (plankton and cod) and physical (sea surface temperature) dataset suggests that synchronous changes in cod numbers and sea temperature have established an extensive trophic cascade favoring lower trophic level groups over economic fisheries. A proliferation of jellyfish that we detect may signal the climax of these changes. This modified North Sea ecology may provide a clear indication of the synergistic consequences of coincident climate change and overfishing. The extent of the ecosystem restructuring that has occurred in the North Sea suggests we are unlikely to reverse current climate and human-induced effects through ecosystem resource management in the short term. Rather, we should understand and adapt to new ecological regimes. This implies that fisheries management policies will have to be fully integrated with the ecological consequences of climate change to prevent a similar collapse in an exploited marine ecosystem elsewhere.},

We also keep track of the relative share of packet pairs which did not lead to a valid RTT sample, e.g. due to loss and/or retransmission events, and use this metric as an additional performance signal. In a previous work we identified the risk of measurement bias due to early retransmission of TCP SYNACK packets by some popular servers. In order to mitigate this problem we introduce here a novel algorithm for dynamic classification and filtering of early retransmitters. We present a few illustrative cases of abrupt-change observed in the real network, based on which we derive some lessons learned about using such data for detecting anomalies in a real network. Thanks to such measurements we were able to discover a hidden congestion bottleneck in the network under study.},

Around 1990, salinity began to significantly decrease and the zooplankton community shifted to a greater dominance by smaller sized species. Annual estimates of the number of cod Gadus morhua and haddock Melogrammus aeglefinus eggs hatched on Georges Bank for the years 1979 to 1987 and 1995 to 1999 allowed calculation of a firstyear survivorship index for both species by dividing the number of new recruits from a virtual population analysis by the hatched egg abundance. The survivorship index for each species also exhibited a major shift between the 2 decades, with cod survivorship declining by a factor of 2 from the 1980s to the 1990s, and haddock survivorship increasing by about the same amount. The strong trend in (or regime-shift nature of) each of the relatively short physical and biological time series makes establishing statistically significant relationships problematic. However, the co-occurrence of major shifts in all of the parameters suggests that a major change in the Georges Bank ecosystem occurred between the 1980s and the 1990s. Identifying the causes of that change and the mechanisms connecting the different components of the system during that change will require additional analyses and modeling.},

Results underline a great difficulty in modelling individual deviations around the mean curve for milk yield. However, the Ali and Schaeffer (5 parameter) model and the fourth-order Legendre polynomials were able to detect two basic shapes of individual deviations among the mean curve. Quadratic and, especially, cubic spline functions had better fitting performances but a poor predictive ability due to their great flexibility that results in an abrupt change of the estimated curve when data are missing.

	doi = {10.1108/01437721011081608},
	abstract = {Purpose - The Saint Valentine's Decree (1984) and the ensuing hard-fought referendum (1985), which reduced the automatisms of scala mobile, started a process of redefinition of wage fixing in Italy, which culminated with the final abolition of scala mobile (1992) and the approval of Protocollo d'intesa (1993). Since then, following new corporatist principles, a national system of centralised wage bargaining (concertazione) and so-called “institutional indexation” have governed the determination of wages. Does incomes policy generate greater coordination in the process of wage formation? Does it cause greater co-movement of wages, prices, labour productivity and unemployment? This paper aims to answer these questions with reference to one of the G8 economies. Design/methodology/approach - After testing for unit root each component by using the ADF, Phillips and Perron, DF-GLS and Zivot and Andrews statistics, the paper tests for co-integration the so-called WPYE model using different methods. The Engle and Granger approach is used to assess the impact of incomes policy on the speed of adjustment of real wages, productivity (and unemployment) to their equilibrium value, while the Gregory and Hansen procedure serves as a means to endogenously detect the presence of a regime shift. The paper estimates coefficients before and after the structural break. Findings - Incomes policy based on the 1993 Protocol has caused a regime shift in the process of wage determination. The long-run estimates of the WPYE model do not generate stationary residuals except when a dummy for 1993 is added. The share of wages over GDP reduces by about ten percentage points in the early 1990s and has stood at about 57 per cent since 1995. The link with productivity is close to one-to-one only before the break. The feedback mechanism, as measured by the coefficient of lagged residuals in short-run estimates, is increased from -0.46 in the pre-reform to -0.79 in the post-reform period, suggesting that incomes policy has increased real wage flexibility indeed. In recent years the link between real wages and (very low) labour productivity growth has weakened. In a sense, incomes policy has introduced a new form of (upward) wage rigidity. Last bat not least, incomes policy has changed the correlation with the unemployment rate from positive to not statistically significant. Research limitations/implications - Future developments will focus on disentangling the impact of incomes policy vis-a-vis other policy interventions on WPYE and on unemployment. Practical implications - The analysis calls for a careful revision of the 1993 Protocol aimed at better protecting the purchasing power of real wages without losing control on inflation, and introducing growth-generating mechanisms. Originality/value - The paper studies the impact of incomes policy on WPYE and the Phillips curve by means of co-integration and structural break analysis. It proposes to interpret the effect of incomes policy on the Phillips curve as changing the coefficient of the error correction mechanism that leads real wages to their long-run equilibrium value.},

Friction (more specifically the maximum coefficient of friction) which is a parameter of tire/road interaction, mainly depends on the state of the road (dry, wet, snow, ice) and is closely related to the efforts at the tire level.

The tools are a free-knot spline mean function estimation method and a Markov-switching vector autoregression model. 3. Our approach detected, with high probability, the occurrence of a regime shift in the zooplankton population in the early to mid-1990s. This was in-line with expectations based on similar events observed in the lake. 4. The suggested approach is a step forward from existing approaches in that it does not require any pre-determent of threshold values but rather relies on a hidden underlying stochastic process that yields probabilities of regime shifts. Thus, it can therefore be applied without introducing any prior biases into the analysis. The approach is, therefore, an objective method in detecting the likely occurrence of a regime shift.},

	abstract = {The detection problem in statistical signal processing can be succinctly formulated: given (possibly) signal bearing, n-dimensional signal-plus-noise snapshot vectors (samples) and statistically independent n-dimensional noise-only snapshot vectors, can one reliably infer the presence of a signal? This problem arises in the context of applications as diverse as radar, sonar, wireless communications, bioinformatics, and machine learning and is the critical first step in the subsequent signal parameter estimation phase. The signal detection problem can be naturally posed in terms of the sample generalized eigenvalues. The sample generalized eigenvalues correspond to the eigenvalues of the matrix formed by “whitening” the signal-plus-noise sample covariance matrix with the noise-only sample covariance matrix. In this paper, we prove a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample generalized eigenvalue-based detection of signals in arbitrarily colored noise when there are relatively few signal bearing and noise-only samples. Specifically, we show why when the (eigen) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is below a critical value, that is a simple function of,, and, then reliable signal detection, in an asymptotic sense, is not possible. If, however, the eigen-SNR is above this critical value then a simple, new random matrix theory-based algorithm, which we present here, will reliably detect the signal even at SNRs close to the critical value. Numerical simulations highlight the accuracy of our analytical prediction, permit us to extend our heuristic definition of the effective number of identifiable signals in colored noise and display the dramatic improvement in performance relative to the classical estimator by Zhao et al. We discuss implications of our result for the detection of weak and/or closely spaced signals in sensor array processing, abrupt change detection in sensor networks, and clustering methodologies in machine learning.},

The former was a red light lasting 500 ms, and the latter was a red light lasting 250 ms immediately followed by a blue light lasting 250 ms Effects of the trial-trial interval, 250 similar to 2000 ms, were investigated to know how cortical responses to the abrupt change (from red to blue) were affected by preceding conditions. The brain response to the deviant trial stimulus was recorded by magnetoencephalography. Results of a multi-dipole analysis showed that the activity in the MUG, peaking at around 150 ms after the change onset, decreased in amplitude as the Interval increased, but the earlier activity in BA 17/18 was not affected by the interval These results suggested that the MUG is an important cortical area relating to the sensory memory-based visual change-detecting system (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved},

Scale analysis is applied to identify the relevant forces leading to the CHF condition. Using these forces, a local parameter model is developed to predict the flow boiling CHF. The theoretical model is an extension of an earlier pool boiling CHF model and incorporates force balance among the evaporation momentum, surface tension, inertia, and viscous forces. Weber number, capillary number, and a new nondimensional group introduced earlier by Kandlikar (2004, “Heat Transfer Mechanisms During Flow Boiling in Microchannels,” ASME J. Heat Transfer, 126, pp. 8-16), K-2, representing the ratio of evaporation momentum to surface tension forces, emerged as main groups in quantifying the narrow channel effects on CHF. The constants in the model were calculated from the available experimental data. The mean error with ten data sets is 19.7\% with 76\% data falling within +/- 30\% error band and 93\% within +/- 50\% error band. The length to diameter ratio emerged as a parameter indicating a stepwise regime change. The success of the model indicates that flow boiling CHF can be modeled as a local phenomenon and the scale analysis is able to reveal important information regarding fundamental mechanisms leading to the CHF condition.

	abstract = {Ecological systems are vulnerable to irreversible change when key system properties are pushed over thresholds, resulting in the loss of resilience and the precipitation of a regime shift. Perhaps the most important of such properties in human-modified landscapes is the total amount of remnant native vegetation. In a seminal study Andren proposed the existence of a fragmentation threshold in the total amount of remnant vegetation, below which landscape-scale connectivity is eroded and local species richness and abundance become dependent on patch size. Despite the fact that species patch-area effects have been a mainstay of conservation science there has yet to be a robust empirical evaluation of this hypothesis. Here we present and test a new conceptual model describing the mechanisms and consequences of biodiversity change in fragmented landscapes, identifying the fragmentation threshold as a first step in a positive feedback mechanism that has the capacity to impair ecological resilience, and drive a regime shift in biodiversity. The model considers that local extinction risk is defined by patch size, and immigration rates by landscape vegetation cover, and that the recovery from local species losses depends upon the landscape species pool. Using a unique dataset on the distribution of non-volant small mammals across replicate landscapes in the Atlantic forest of Brazil, we found strong evidence for our model predictions - that patch-area effects are evident only at intermediate levels of total forest cover, where landscape diversity is still high and opportunities for enhancing biodiversity through local management are greatest. Furthermore, high levels of forest loss can push native biota through an extinction filter, and result in the abrupt, landscape-wide loss of forest-specialist taxa, ecological resilience and management effectiveness.

We then design a global test to assess the global significance of the potential ZACs, an issue missing in all existing methods. The theory that links the threshold and the global level is based on asymptotic distributions of excursion sets of non-stationary chi (2) fields for which we provide new results.

	abstract = {Beijing, the capital of China, has suffered a prolonged drought of 12 years from 1999 to 2010. The regime shift detection methods have identified the increase of mean annual temperature, the decrease of annual evaporation, and the decrease of annual precipitation. The Standardized Precipitation Index clearly shows a downward shift from more wet years in 1960s and 1970s to more dry years in 2000s. The observed total decrease of groundwater levels from 1999 to 2010 ranges from 20 to 40 m, indicating rapid depletion of groundwater resources. Water shortage during the recent long dry spell was simply met with the construction of six new emergency well fields since 2003. The drought has a direct impact on groundwater resources by reducing natural recharge. The drought also triggered the increase of groundwater abstraction for emergency water supply. These direct and indirect impacts of the drought on the depletion of groundwater storage have been analysed with a transient groundwater flow model. The drought-triggered increase of groundwater abstraction has accelerated the depletion of groundwater storage, especially in the Chaobai River catchment. To reverse the trend of further groundwater depletion, a combination of the reduction of groundwater abstraction and the artificially enhanced groundwater recharge was simulated with the model and was found as the most feasible scenario. A drought management plan is urgently needed to shift from crisis management to drought preparedness and risk management. The groundwater depletion situation in the Beijing Plain is very grim and extraordinary actions must be taken to achieve sustainable groundwater use.},

	abstract = {It is well known that human activities, such as harvesting, have had major direct effects on marine ecosystems. However, it is far less acknowledged that human activities in the surroundings might have important effects on marine systems. There is growing evidence suggesting that major reorganization (i.e., a regime shift) is a common feature in the temporal evolution of a marine system. Here we show, and quantify, the interaction of human activities (nutrient upload) with a favourable climate (run-off) and its contribution to the eutrophication of the Black Sea in the 1980s. Based on virtual analysis of the bottom-up (eutrophication) vs. top-down (trophic cascades) effects, we found that an earlier onset of eutrophication could have counteracted the restructuring of the trophic regulation at the base of the food web that resulted from the depletion of top predators in the 1970s. These enhanced bottom-up effects would, however, not propagate upwards in the food web beyond the zooplankton level. Our simulations identified the removal of apex predators as a key element in terms of loss of resilience that inevitably leads to a reorganization. Once the food web has been truncated, the type and magnitude of interventions on the group replacing the apex predator as the new upper trophic level have no effect in preventing the trophic cascade. By characterizing the tipping point at which increased bottom-up forcing exactly counteracts the top-down cascading effects, our results emphasize the importance of a comprehensive analysis that take into account all structuring forces at play (including those beyond the marine system) at a given time.},

The results show that a discontinuous abrupt change in the mid-1970s in the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis was observed in the tropical lower and middle stratospheric temperature. The shift in temperature and its timing agrees well with the climate regime shift discovered in the radiosonde observations (HadAT), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40), and many previous studies and manifests a statistically significant change at the 95\% confidence level. A corresponding change of the SRI was identified in the mid 1970s although the statistical t test value is not very high. The running correlation with a 21-year moving time window exhibits a strong positive correlation between the solar cycle and atmospheric temperature in the tropical stratosphere during the period of 1948-2007. However, the positive correlation was broken at the time of the mid-1970s abrupt change and two peak positive correlation points were observed in 1972 and 1982, respectively.},

The Kondo spins are further coupled to each other with isotropic nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions which are tuned to the Majumdar-Ghosh point. Focusing on three-eighths filling and using the density-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) method, we show that the zero-temperature transition between the phases with small and large Fermi momenta appears continuous, and involves a new intermediate phase where the Fermi surface is not well defined. The intermediate phase is spin gapped and has Kondo-spin correlations that show incommensurate modulations. Our results appear incompatible with the local picture for the quantum phase transition in heavy fermion compounds, which predicts an abrupt change in the size of the Fermi momentum.},

Coincident regime shifts were detected in phytoplankton, benthos, and fish in 1995, which was just after invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena spp.) became established in the bay in 1993-1994. Two independent methods were used to detect these shifts: 1) principal components analysis followed by a Regime Shift Detector test for a change point in the running mean of the first principal component scores and (2) measurements of significant difference between pre- and post-Dreissena ecosystem structure based on measures of Bray-Curtis community similarity. Although a statistically significant shift was not detected in the zooplankton community by itself, zooplankton variables were instrumental in the overall ecosystem shift, determined for the combined four communities. All 32 variables were ranked for their individual contribution to the difference between the pre- and post-Dreissena ecosystem structures. The resolution of two distinct ecosystem structures, pre- and post-Dreissena, was greatly improved after employing a novel method of variable optimization that involved a selective and sequential removal of variables contributing least to the statistical difference between pre- and post-Dreissena ecosystem structures. The resultant 20-variable subset defined a 1995 ecosystem regime shift at very high level of statistical confidence (ANOSIM-R=0.970). (C) 2010 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Fish assemblages in one regulated and one unregulated tributary paired in each of two sub-catchments of the Hunter River, coastal New South Wales, Australia, were sampled monthly between August 2006 and June 2007. It was predicted that altered flow regime due to flow regulation would reduce species richness and abundance of native fish, and assemblage composition would differ between paired regulated and unregulated tributaries. Despite significant changes in richness, abundance and assemblage composition through time, differences between regulated and unregulated tributaries were not consistent. In February 2007, an environmental flow release ('artificial flood') of 1400 ML was experimentally released down the regulated tributary of one of the two catchments over 6 days. The flow release resulted in no significant changes in fish species abundances or assemblage composition when compared to nearby unregulated and regulated tributaries. Flow regulation in this region has reduced flow variability and eliminated natural low-flow periods, although large floods occurred at similar frequencies between regulated-unregulated tributaries prior to and during 2006-2007, resulting in only moderate changes to regulated flow regimes. Barriers to dispersal within catchments also compound the effects of flow regulation, and findings from this study indicate that the location of migratory barriers potentially confounded detection of the effects of flow regime change. Further experimental comparisons of fish assemblages in regulated rivers will refine river-specific response thresholds to flow regime change and facilitate the sustainable use of water in coastal rivers.

For effective As/Ga ratios {\textless}1, in situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction measurements reveal clear NW growth delay due to formation of liquid Ga droplets since the growth proceeds via the vapor liquid solid mechanism. In contrast, for effective As/Ga ratios {\textgreater}1 an immediate onset of NW growth is observed indicating a transition to droplet-free, facet-driven selective area growth with low vertical growth rates. Distinctly different microstructures, facet formation and either the presence or absence of Ga droplets at the apex of NWs, are further elucidated by transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the growth mode transition is caused by an abrupt change from As- to Ga-limited conditions at the (111)-oriented NW growth front, allowing precise tuning of the dominant growth mode.},

	abstract = {Given a sequence of observations, has a change occurred in the underlying probability distribution with respect to observation order? This problem of detecting change points arises in a variety of applications including health prognostics for mechanical systems, syndromic disease surveillance in geographically dispersed populations, anomaly detection in information networks, and multivariate process control in general. Detecting change points in high-dimensional settings is challenging, and most change-point methods for multidimensional problems rely upon distributional assumptions or the use of observation history to model probability distributions. We present three new nonparametric statistical tests for heterogeneity based on the combinatorial properties of minimum non-bipartite matching (MNBM). The key idea underlying each of these tests is that if a sequence of independent random observations undergoes a change in distribution-either an abrupt “shift” or a gradual “drift”-a MNBM based on inter-point distances tends to produce pairings that are closer in the sequence labeling than would be the case if the observations were drawn from the same distribution. Our tests follow on the work of Rosenbaum (2005) who used MNBM to derive a simple cross-match test statistic for the two-sample problem based on this idea. Similar ideas are present in the minimum spanning tree (MST) test derived by Friedman and Rafsky (1979, 1981). We extend these approaches by utilizing ensembles of orthogonal MNBMs which greatly increase information extraction from the data, leading to tests that compare favorably to parametric procedures while maintaining level and good power properties across distributions.},

First, we analyzed the monthly anomalies and looked for a relationship of such anomalies with total solar irradiance (TSI) and then the Regime Shift Detector (RSD) was applied to detect possible temperature regimes in the series. Afterwards, we calculated a yearly temperature range per pixel (amplitude of seasonal cycle) and through the subtraction of a latitudinal theoretical curve of temperature based on solar irradiance, the residuals of the seasonal cycle were obtained. The results showed an almost complete spatial synchrony and dominance of negative anomalies from 1950 to mid-late 1970's, with a switch to near-zero and positive anomalies that lasted up to late 1990's when a new shift to negative values was detected. Such a shift lasted until the early 2000's when positive anomalies appeared again but there was a change to negative anomalies in the late 2000's. These results were supported by the RSD. The TSI variability shows a clear relationship with that of sea surface temperature anomalies and with the regime changes. This is probably due to a difference in the amount of energy received from the sun. Comparing the “cool regime” versus the “warm regime”, the second one received 0.39\% more energy (approximately 3x10(8) Jm(-2)) from the sun. Seasonal cycles show larger ranges at northern latitudes ({\textgreater}40 degrees N), northern tropical-temperate transition zone (20 degrees-26 degrees N) and in the tropical-equatorial band (0 degrees-30 degrees S). The smallest ranges occur at 0 degrees-16 degrees N and 50 degrees-60 degrees S. The residuals (seasonal minus the theoretical curve) indicated a clear modulation due to advection by ocean currents.},

After event identification, our method uses the CUSUM algorithm to fit the levels inside every event and automatically extracts their time and amplitude information. This facilitates the statistical analysis of an event population with a given number of levels. The obtained information improves the interpretation of interactions between the molecule and nanopore. Since our program does not require any prior information about the analyzed molecules, novel molecule-nanopore interactions can be characterized. In addition our program is very fast and stable.

During the crisis periods, financial markets are, in general, subject to an abrupt regime shift which imposes a significant challenge to option pricing models. In this context, swiftly evolving markets and institutions require valuation models that are capable of recognizing and adapting to such changes. Both parametric and non-parametric pricing models have shown poor forecast ability for options traded in late 1987 and 2008. Surprisingly, the pricing inaccuracy was more pronounced for non-parametric models than for parametric models. To address this problem, we propose a novel hybrid methodology modular neural network-fuzzy learning vector quantization (MNN-FLVQ) model - that uses the Kohonen unsupervised learning and fuzzy clustering algorithms to classify the S\&P 500 stock market index options, and thereby detect a regime shift. In our empirical application, the results for the 2008 financial crisis demonstrate that the MNN-FLVQ model is superior to the competing methods in regards to option pricing during regime shifts.},

Hence, the maximum delay for detection should be upper bounded and the traditional quickest change detection criterion is compromised. The new proposed optimality criterion promotes the maximization of the signal detection probability provided that the detection delay and the false alarm rate are upper bounded. A suboptimal detection algorithm based on a window limited cumulative sum test with a variable threshold is offered. The proposed method is analyzed theoretically and by simulation in case of Gaussian observations. A finite variable threshold is necessary to optimize the proposed algorithm which outperforms the conventional CUSUM test.

	abstract = {The percent carrying capacity K-p is the equilibrium population in percentage terms of a species that an area can support while adequately meeting the needs of every individual. It is readily determined from a time series of percentage abundances for a species, in which p(it) is the percentage abundance of the ith species at time t. The percentage point change in abundance of a species Delta p(i) between two samples is given by Delta p(i) = p(it+1) - p(it) where p(it+1) is the percentage abundance at a subsequent time t + 1. The rate of population change in percentage points for each percent at a given time or point t, here termed r(t), is given by r(t)=Delta p(i)/Delta p(it). Linear regression of r(t) against p(it) gives r(t) = r(m) - s.p(it), in which the constant r(m) is the rate of increase in r(t) where p(it) approaches zero, and the negative slope s represents the combined strength of intraspecific, interspecific and abiotic interactions for the species investigated. Setting r(t)= 0, so that p(it)= K-p and r(m)-s.K-p= 0, gives K-p = r(m)/s. The Upper Quaternary of ODP 1006A contains two subsections with rich bathyal benthic foraminiferal assemblages separated by samples yielding few specimens. Values of r(m), s and K-p were calculated for five species (Globocassidulina subglobosa, Planulina ariminensis, Cibicidoides pachyderma, Cassidulina laevigata, Uvigerina laevis) within these subsections and 95\% confidence intervals were computed for r, and s. The rate of change of the percentage abundance for each percent rt, as indicated by the slope s, differs between species (P. ariminensis and C pachyderma vs. C laevigata) and can also vary within a single species over time (G. subglobosa). Likewise, values of r, differ between species (P. ariminensis vs. C pachyderma) and can also change within a single species over time (G. subglobosa). Points of change from one value of 14, to another in a stratigraphic section mark regime shifts and have potential for ecostratigraphic correlation. Within the Upper Quaternary of ODP Hole 1006A they apparently reflect an increase in the organic matter flux in the uppermost part of the section. The method described here can be applied to any species in any taxon for which percentage data are available. For those in the hydrocarbon industry it should prove especially useful for detailed studies of intervals of economic interest. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {On the basis of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), a new method, moving cut data-DFA (MC-DFA), was presented to detect abrupt dynamic change in correlated time series. The numerical tests show the capability of the presented method to detect abrupt change time-instants in model time series generated by Logistic map. Moving DFA (MDFA) and approximate entropy (ApEn) can provide some information such as a single time-instant of abrupt dynamic change, but both of them cannot exactly detect all of the abrupt change regions. Some traditional methods, such as moving t-test, Cramer method, MannKendall test and Yamamoto method, even cannot provide any information of abrupt dynamic change in these model time series. Meanwhile, results showed that windows sizes and strong noise have some less effect on the MC-DFA results. In summary, MC-DFA provides a reliable measure to detect the abrupt dynamic change in correlated time series, and perfectively make up the deficiencies of MDFA and ApEn. The applications in daily surface air pressure records further verify the validity of the present method. Copyright (c) 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

This paper aims at a better understanding of the development of the water allocation regime in the Yellow River Basin between 1950 and 2009, introducing a fresh perspective based on the notion of “regime transition”. Accordingly, we investigated 1) whether so-called “Windows of Opportunity for Transition (WOPTs)” emerged, triggering a transition, and whether WOPT(s) resulted in a stable transition towards the new regime; 2) how informal learning processes and epistemic communities have contributed to the regime change. We adapted Kingdon's “multiple stream model” and identified four WOPTs from the 1950s, analyzing the reconfiguration process of the regime after the onset of the transition. Our examples of two types of informal learning processes demonstrate their contribution to the creation of WOPTs and the reconfiguration of the regime. Furthermore, this study indicates, in a qualitative manner, how epistemic communities contribute to the knowledge base of the regime, and thus to its development. Finally, we have provided a general insight into the further development of the water allocation regime and highlighted potential avenues for further studies.},

The coupled wellbore-reservoir flow model is used to analyze a layered reservoir with an abrupt change in permeability and a thick formation showing a gradual change in permeability with depth. Contrary to conventional reservoir models, this new model is able to capture the wellbore storage effect directly and can handle wells with partial or complete perforations.

	abstract = {The shallow and land-locked northern Adriatic basin has undergone several changes at different trophic levels over the last decades, of which the most recent and basin-wide is the negative trend in concentrations of chlorophyll a over the last decade. To investigate it in detail, we performed a robust analysis of abiotic parameters and plankton community structure in the period 1989-2009 in the Gulf of Trieste. The gradual sequence of events, which encompassed hydrological and ecological systems, was identified as a regime shift in 2002/2003. Synchronised step changes in river runoff and surface salinity and decreasing concentrations of nitrate and silicate were followed by changes in chlorophyll a. The decline in phytoplankton biomass was due to the reduction of seasonal diatom blooms and the predominance of the smaller sized fraction. The changes also encompassed a higher trophic level showing significantly reduced zooplankton biomass after 2002. Our results show that despite the scientifically recognised impact of large-scale climate drivers on Adriatic plankton communities, the Gulf remains largely controlled, either through local climatic (precipitation, river runoff) or anthropogenic (eutrophication) forcing. Under the resource-replete and high biomass regime bottom-up control prevails, while in the new regime of reduced resources and biomass the switch from bottom-up to top-down control can occur seasonally.

	abstract = {Ecological regime shift is the rapid transition from one stable community structure to another, often ecologically inferior, stable community. Such regime shifts are especially common in shallow marine communities, such as the transition of kelp forests to algal turfs that harbour far lower biodiversity. Stable regimes in communities are a result of balanced interactions between species, and predicting new regimes therefore requires an evaluation of new species interactions, as well as the resilience of the `stable' position. While computational optimisation techniques can predict new potential regimes, predicting the most likely community state of the various options produced is currently educated guess work. In this study we integrate a stable regime optimisation approach with a Bayesian network used to infer prior knowledge of the likely stress of climate change (or, in practice, any other disturbance) on each component species of a representative rocky shore community model. Combining the results, by calculating the product of the match between resilient computational predictions and the posterior probabilities of the Bayesian network, gives a refined set of model predictors, and demonstrates the use of the process in determining community changes, as might occur through processes such as climate change. To inform Bayesian priors, we conduct a review of molecular approaches applied to the analysis of the transcriptome of rocky shore organisms, and show how such an approach could be linked to measureable stress variables in the field. Hence species-specific microarrays could be designed as biomarkers of in situ stress, and used to inform predictive modelling approaches such as those described here.},

Therefore, this study tries to specify factors affecting the leadership rather than looking at a broad matrix of indicators. This study assumes that it becomes increasingly important for the North Korean leadership to provide privileged benefits to rent-seeking elites for the regime maintenance and hence tries to analyze variables related to change of identity and interests of the North Korean power elites. First, it identifies key variables of North Korea's stability by reclassifying indicators from the indicator clusters examined in the previous studies. Next, it analyzes factors directly related to the leader-follower relationship in North Korea such as ruling ideology, elite composition, rent-seeking behaviors and opportunity cost of choosing alternative options. Findings of this study reveal many paradoxes in North Korea and suggest that North Korean elites' support for the Kim Jong Un regime depends on the young new leader's ability to retain the mechanism of providing benefits to the elites and increasing the opportunity cost of elites' defection.},

The performance of classical methods for change-point detection typically scales poorly with the dimensionality of the data, so that a large number of observations are collected after the true change-point before it can be reliably detected. Furthermore, missing components in the observed data handicap conventional approaches. The proposed method addresses these challenges by modeling the dynamic distribution underlying the data as lying close to a time-varying low-dimensional submanifold embedded within the ambient observation space. Specifically, streaming data is used to track a submanifold approximation, measure deviations from this approximation, and calculate a series of statistics of the deviations for detecting when the underlying manifold has changed in a sharp or unexpected manner. The approach described in this paper leverages several recent results in the field of high-dimensional data analysis, including subspace tracking with missing data, multiscale analysis techniques for point clouds, online optimization, and change-point detection performance analysis. Simulations and experiments highlight the robustness and efficacy of the proposed approach in detecting an abrupt change in an otherwise slowly varying low-dimensional manifold.},

Tipping points and regime shifts routinely are documented retrospectively in long time series of observational data. Experimental induction of tipping points and regime shifts is rare, but could lead to new methods for detecting impending tipping points and forestalling regime shifts. By using controlled additions of detrital organic matter (dried, ground arthropod prey), we experimentally induced a shift from aerobic to anaerobic states in a miniature aquatic ecosystem: the self-contained pools that form in leaves of the carnivorous northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea. In unfed controls, the concentration of dissolved oxygen ([O-2]) in all replicates exhibited regular diurnal cycles associated with daytime photosynthesis and nocturnal plant respiration. In low prey-addition treatments, the regular diurnal cycles of [O-2] were disrupted, but a regime shift was not detected. In high prey-addition treatments, the variance of the [O-2] time series increased until the system tipped from an aerobic to an anaerobic state. In these treatments, replicate [O-2] time series predictably crossed a tipping point at similar to 45 h as [O-2] was decoupled from diurnal cycles of photosynthesis and respiration. Increasing organic-matter loading led to predictable changes in [O-2] dynamics, with high loading consistently driving the system past a well-defined tipping point. The Sarracenia microecosystem functions as a tractable experimental system in which to explore the forecasting and management of tipping points and alternative regimes.},

Tests on model time series and 1000 simulated daily precipitation data show the ability of the present method to identify and detect abrupt change of probability density function. The applications of STP in daily precipitation data show that there is an abrupt climate change between 1979 and 1980 in the selected observational stations, which is almost the same with the result obtained by approximate entropy (ApEn). Furthermore, it is found that the sample sizes of sliding windows have some influence on the Lambda parameter of the Box-Cox transformation, but it does not significantly affect the varying trend of the parameter and the identification of the change point in annual or interannual time scale. Comparing STP with the coefficient of skewness and kurtosis, ApEn, and some statistics approaches (e.g. percentiles and annual maxima), we find that the performance of the present method is much better than that of these methods.},

This paper has presented an empirical investigation into the demand for Nigerian real narrow money (M1) over the period 1960-2008 in an attempt to identify whether the CBN were right to adopt the new monetary policy framework. In doing so, we estimate alternative (canonical and extended) specifications of M1 demand using structural change methods. Our results suggest that the canonical specification is well-determined. Although the money demand relationship went through a regime shift in 1986, it is largely stable.

	isbn = {978-1-4799-4032-5},
	abstract = {Squirrel-cage induction motors (IM) are the most popular motors used in industry, consuming around 85\% of the power in industrial plants. IM are critical components for most industries, and an early detection of induction motor faults has been a main subject of investigation during last years. Broken rotor bars in induction motors are among the major failures that are desirable to detect at early stages because this failure significantly increases power consumption and is responsible for further damage to the machinery. However, the detection of partially-broken rotor bars at an early stage is not so easily achieved. Therefore, it is necessary to use suitable condition monitoring accompanied with signal processing techniques to detect a partially-broken rotor bar. Thus, this paper focuses on a study and evaluation of a condition monitoring method based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition CEEMD of the stator current; aiming to detect partially broken, one, and two broken rotor bars in a line fed IM during the startup current transient. From the experimental results, the CEEMD is able to graphically show, in the time domain, the physical effect of the fault evolution during the startup current as an abrupt change in the envelope, and finally, these abrupt changes are quantified in a way that the level of fault can be identified correctly. Also, the CEEMD has the advantage of being an online diagnosis method, which does not require knowing a priori the motor current of the healthy condition.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a historical socio-hydrological analysis of the Tarim River basin (TRB), Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, in Western China, from the time of the opening of the Silk Road to the present. The analysis is aimed at exploring the historical co-evolution of coupled human-water systems and at identifying common patterns or organizing principles underpinning socio-hydrological systems (SHS). As a self-organized entity, the evolution of the human-water system in the Tarim Basin reached stable states for long periods of time, but then was punctuated by sudden shifts due to internal or external disturbances. In this study, we discuss three stable periods (i.e., natural, human exploitation, and degradation and recovery) and the transitions in between during the past 2000 years. During the “natural” stage that existed pre-18th century, with small-scale human society and sound environment, evolution of the SHS was mainly driven by natural environmental changes such as river channel migration and climate change. During the human exploitation stage, especially in the 19th and 20th centuries, it experienced rapid population growth, massive land reclamation and fast socio-economic development, and humans became the principal players of system evolution. By the 1970s, the Tarim Basin had evolved into a new regime with a vulnerable eco-hydrological system seemingly populated beyond its carrying capacity, and a human society that began to suffer from serious water shortages, land salinization and desertification. With intensified deterioration of river health and increased recognition of unsustainability of traditional development patterns, human intervention and recovery measures have since been adopted. As a result, the basin has shown a reverse regime shift towards some healing of the environmental damage. Based on our analysis within TRB and a common theory of social development, four general types of SHSs are defined according to their characteristic spatio-temporal variations of historical co-evolution, including primitive agricultural, traditional agricultural, industrial agricultural, and urban SHSs. These co-evolutionary changes have been explained in the paper in terms of the Taiji-Tire model, a refinement of a special concept in Chinese philosophy, relating to the co-evolution of a system because of interactions among its components.},

By 2025, the IUCN aims to assess the collapse risk of all the world's ecosystems using this framework. This increases the pressure to refine tractable methods to predict collapse. However, there has been no systematic review of whether predicting collapse is possible and practical, which is impeding consistent and comparable assessments of ecosystem threat. Here, we conduct such a review and highlight six areas of concern - stemming from the findings of our review in need of immediate attention to progress work on assessing ecosystem collapse and the application of such assessments to the management of at-risk ecosystems. These are: (1) better conceptualizations of ecosystems, (2) better conceptualizations of ecosystem collapse, (3) improved integration of theory, experimentation, and practice, (4) improved surrogates and early warning indicators of ecosystem collapse, (5) the implementation of management experiments to enhance understanding of ecosystem stability, and (6) ensuring IUCN Red List of Ecosystems listings result in the conservation of biodiversity.},

Previous theoretical work has generated numerous early-warning indicators of regime shifts, some of which have been empirically demonstrated in closed ecological systems. Here we evaluated a suite of indicators using a previously studied three-species model under conditions likely to be observed in field studies of open ecological systems. Simulations included large correlated fluctuations in extrinsic noise and a rapidly changing driving variable, while indicators were calculated using sparsely sampled time series. All indicators performed poorly under these conditions, particularly during the beginning of the regime shift. Overall, the best performing indicator was a rise in variance. Future research should focus on methods for setting benchmark values of early warning indicators and for identifying indicators that work for sparsely sampled data sets.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem regime shifts are abrupt changes from one dynamical state to another, such as the shift from a clear-water state to an algal bloom state in lakes. These transitions are hard to forecast but theory suggests that early warning indicators can predict impending regime shifts that may allow for management intervention to prevent or mitigate an unwanted change. The efficacy of early warning indicators has been demonstrated in modeling and laboratory experiments, but rarely in the field, where environmental drivers are numerous and interacting. It is unclear if early warning indicators are observable or timely enough to allow for intervention under these conditions. We performed six whole-lake experimental nutrient additions to test the utility of early warning indicators for predicting the regime shift from a clear-water state to a cyanobacteria-dominated state. The lakes were monitored for increases in resilience indicators including rises in standard deviation and autocorrelation of algal pigments and dissolved oxygen saturation. A statistical method, quickest detection, determined when resilience indicators in manipulated lakes deviated substantially from those in a reference ecosystem. Blooms occurred in five of the six lake-years. Although there was substantial variability in bloom size and timing, at least one indicator foreshadowed the peak chlorophyll a concentration in all instances. Early warnings occurred 1–57 d prior to a bloom, which in some instances, may allow managers to notify the public or intervene to prevent blooms. The resilience indicators generally identified changes in resilience over time within a lake and also ranked large differences in resilience among lakes. Our findings suggest that resilience indicators can be useful for classifying ecosystems on a landscape and across time with respect to proximity to a critical threshold.},

We assume that the number of change-points can increase to infinity with the sample size. Due to a certain random localisation mechanism, WBS works even for very short spacings between the change-points and/or very small jump magnitudes, unlike standard binary segmentation. On the other hand, despite its use of localisation, WBS does not require the choice of a window or span parameter, and does not lead to a significant increase in computational complexity. WBS is also easy to code. We propose two stopping criteria for WBS: one based on thresholding and the other based on what we term the `strengthened Schwarz information criterion'. We provide default recommended values of the parameters of the procedure and show that it offers very good practical performance in comparison with the state of the art. The WBS methodology is implemented in the R package wbs, available on CRAN. In addition, we provide a new proof of consistency of binary segmentation with improved rates of convergence, as well as a corresponding result for WBS.},

The main aspects are the properties of the estimators, including the estimates of the break dates, and the construction of tests that allow inference to be made about the presence of structural change and the number of breaks. We consider the general case of a partial structural change model where not all parameters are subject to shifts. We study both fixed and shrinking magnitudes of shifts and obtain the rates of convergence for the estimated break fractions. We also propose a procedure that allows one to test the null hypothesis of, say, l changes, versus the alternative hypothesis of l + 1 changes. This is particularly useful in that it allows a specific to general modeling strategy to consistently determine the appropriate number of changes present. An estimation strategy for which the location of the breaks need not be simultaneously determined is discussed. Instead, our method successively estimates each break point.},

The approach is to avoid assumptions about the distribution of mixing rates (or other parameters) in the population, by treating the low-order moments of the distribution as estimable parameters. This approach, while approximate, can greatly reduce the number of parameters needed to explore the effects of population heterogeneity on disease dynamics. This makes the approach useful for both inference and prediction, and also for gaining insight into the qualitative effects of heterogeneity on the spread of disease. This paper focuses on populations with variations in mixing rate and random mixing. It is shown that moment-based approximations can provide good quantitative estimates of disease dynamics, as well as aiding in qualitative under- standing, over a respectable range of parameters. It is hoped that this approach will provide a useful complement to more traditional box models of heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity plays a vital role for ecosystem functioning in a changing environment. Yet theoretical approaches that incorporate diversity into classical ecosystem theory do not provide a general dynamic theory based on mechanistic principles. In this paper, we suggest that approaches developed for quantitative genetics can be extended to ecosystem functioning by modeling the means and variances of phenotypes within a group of species. We present a framework that suggests that phenotypic variance within functional groups is linearly related to their ability to respond to environmental changes. As a result, the long-term productivity for a group of species with high phenotypic variance may be higher than for the best single species, even though high phenotypic variance decreases productivity in the short term, because suboptimal species are present. In addition, we find that in the case of accelerating environmental change, species succession in a changing environment may become discontinuous. Our work suggests that this phenomenon is related to diversity as well as to the environmental disturbance regime, both of which are affected by anthropogenic activities. By introducing new techniques for modeling the aggregate behavior of groups of species, the present approach may provide a new avenue for ecosystem analysis.},

Size-spectrum models are one type of physiologically-structured ecological model that provide a feasible approach to describing fish communities in terms of individual dietary variation and ontogenetic niche shift. Despite the potential of ecological models in improving our understanding of ecosystems, their application is usually limited for data-poor fisheries. As a first step in implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), this study built a size-spectrum model for the fish community in the Haizhou Bay, China. We describe data collection procedures and model parameterization to facilitate the implementation of such size-spectrum models for future studies of data-poor ecosystems. The effects of fishing on the ecosystem were exemplified with a range of fishing effort and were monitored with a set of ecological indicators. Total community biomass, biodiversity index, W-statistic, LFI (Large fish index), MeanW (mean body weight) and Slope (slope of community size spectra) showed a strong non-linear pattern in response to fishing pressure, and largest fishing effort did not generate the most drastic responses in certain scenarios. We emphasize the value and feasibility of developing size-spectrum models to capture ecological dynamics and suggest limitations as well as potential for model improvement. This study aims to promote a wide use of this type of model in support of EBFM.},

	abstract = {We review observational data sets that have been used to detect regime shifts in the ocean. Through exploration of data time series we develop a definition of a regime shift from a pragmatic perspective, in which a shift is considered as an abrupt change from a quantifiable ecosystem state. We conclude that such changes represent a restructuring of the ecosystem state in some substantial sense that persists for long enough that a new quasi-equilibrium state can be observed. The abruptness of the shift is relative to the life-scale or the reproductive time-scale of the higher predators that are influenced by the shift. In general, the event-forcing is external to the biological ecosystem, usually the physical climate system, but we also identify shifts that can be ascribed to anthropogenic forcing, in our examples fishing. This pragmatic definition allows for several different types of regime shift ranging from simple biogeographic shifts to non-linear state changes. In practice it is quite difficult to determine whether observed changes in an oceanic ecosystem are primarily spatial or temporally regulated. The determination of ecosystem state remains an unresolved, and imprecise, oceanographic problem. We review observations and interpretation from several different oceanic regions as examples to illustrate this pragmatic definition of a regime shift: the Northeast Pacific, the Northwest and Northeast Atlantic, and Eastern Boundary Currents. For each region, different types of data (biological and physical) are available for differing periods of time, and we conclude, with varying degrees of certainty, whether a regime shift is in fact detectable in the data.},

Although there is convincing evidence that human drivers can cause regime shifts at local and regional scales, the increasingly invoked concept of planetary scale tipping points in the terrestrial biosphere remains unconfirmed. By evaluating potential mechanisms and drivers, we conclude that spatial heterogeneity in drivers and responses, and lack of strong continental interconnectivity, probably induce relatively smooth changes at the global scale, without an expectation of marked tipping patterns. This implies that identifying critical points along global continua of drivers might be unfeasible and that characterizing global biotic change with single aggregates is inapt.},

Large spatial and temporal scales of dynamics, and the lack of frameworks linking observations to models, are challenges to understanding and predicting ecosystem responses to perturbations. The naturally-occurring microecosystem inside leaves of the northern pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) exhibits oligotrophic and eutrophic states that can be induced by adding insect prey. Here, we further develop a model for simulating these dynamics, parameterize it using data from a prey addition experiment and conduct a sensitivity analysis to identify critical zones within the parameter space. Simulations illustrate that the microecosystem model displays regime shifts and hysteresis. Parallel results were observed in the plant itself after experimental enrichment with prey. Decomposition rate of prey was the main driver of system dynamics, including the time the system remains in an anoxic state and the rate of return to an oxygenated state. Biological oxygen demand influenced the shape of the system's return trajectory. The combination of simulated results, sensitivity analysis and use of empirical results to parameterize the model more precisely demonstrates that the Sarracenia microecosystem model displays behaviors qualitatively similar to models of larger ecological systems.},

	abstract = {Global environmental change presents a clear need for improved leading indicators of critical transitions, especially those that can be generated from compositional data and that work in empirical cases. Ecological theory of community dynamics under environmental forcing predicts an early replacement of slowly replicating and weakly competitive “canary” species by slowly replicating but strongly competitive “keystone” species. Further forcing leads to the eventual collapse of the keystone species as they are replaced by weakly competitive but fast-replicating “weedy” species in a critical transition to a significantly different state. We identify a diagnostic signal of these changes in the coefficients of a correlation between compositional disorder and biodiversity. Compositional disorder measures unpredictability in the composition of a community, while biodiversity measures the amount of species in the community. In a stochastic simulation, sequential correlations over time switch from positive to negative as keystones prevail over canaries, and back to positive with domination of weedy species. The model finds support in empirical tests on multi-decadal time series of fossil diatom and chironomid communities from lakes in China. The characteristic switch from positive to negative correlation coefficients occurs for both communities up to three decades preceding a critical transition to a sustained alternate state. This signal is robust to unequal time increments that beset the identification of early-warning signals from other metrics.},

The temporal resolution, spatial coverage, and accessibility of these data open up new opportunities for better understanding and managing the coastal ocean, but they also present enormous challenges relative to data processing and data interpretation, particularly in cases where these data are to inform rapid management decision making. Here we demonstrate that changes in surf zone water quality at a popular beach in southern California are signaled by changes in the Fisher Information and Shannon Entropy of high frequency (1/4 min-1) measurements of salinity and temperature in the surf zone. These results support the hypothesis that the information content of environmental signals, such as salinity and temperature, can be used to identify changes in the water quality of the coastal ocean. More generally, the approach described hereof using information theory indices calculated from monitoring data as real-time indicators of environmental changeis quite general, and may therefore be applicable to other situations where rapid management decisions are based on high-frequency measurements of environmental parameters.},

	abstract = {Synthesis The quickly expanding literature on early warning signals for critical transitions in ecosystems suggests that critical slowing down is a key phenomenon to measure the distance to a tipping point in ecosystems. Such work is broadly misinterpreted as showing that slowing down is specific to tipping points. In this contribution, we show why this is not the case. Early warning signals based on critical slowing down indicate a broader class of situations where a system becomes increasingly sensitive to perturbations. Ecosystem responses to external changes can surprise us by their abruptness and irreversibility. Models have helped identifying indicators of impending catastrophic shifts, referred to as ‘generic early warning signals’. These indicators are linked to a phenomenon known as ‘critical slowing down’ which describes the fact that the recovery rate of a system after a perturbation decreases when the system approaches a bifurcation – such as the classical fold bifurcation associated to catastrophic shifts. However, contrary to what has sometimes been suggested in the literature, a decrease in recovery rate cannot be considered as specific to approaching catastrophic shifts. Here, we analyze the behavior of early warning signals based on critical slowing down in systems approaching a range of catastrophic and non-catastrophic situations. Our results show that slowing down generally happens in situations where a system is becoming increasingly sensitive to external perturbations, independently of whether the impeding change is catastrophic or not. These results highlight that indicators specific to catastrophic shifts are still lacking. More importantly, they also imply that in systems where we have no reason to expect catastrophic transitions, slowing down may still be used in a more general sense as a warning signal for a potential decrease in stability.},

Some of these phenomena, such as the scaling of demographic variance, are related to small size3,4,5,6 whereas others result from density-dependent nonlinearities7. Although understanding the causes of population extinction has been a central problem in theoretical biology for decades8, the ability to anticipate extinction has remained elusive9. Here we argue that the causes of a population’s decline are central to the predictability of its extinction. Specifically, environmental degradation may cause a tipping point in population dynamics, corresponding to a bifurcation in the underlying population growth equations, beyond which decline to extinction is almost certain. In such cases, imminent extinction will be signalled by critical slowing down (CSD). We conducted an experiment with replicate laboratory populations of Daphnia magna to test this hypothesis. We show that populations crossing a transcritical bifurcation, experimentally induced by the controlled decline in environmental conditions, show statistical signatures of CSD after the onset of environmental deterioration and before the critical transition. Populations in constant environments did not have these patterns. Four statistical indicators all showed evidence of the approaching bifurcation as early as 110 days (∼8 generations) before the transition occurred. Two composite indices improved predictability, and comparative analysis showed that early warning signals based solely on observations in deteriorating environments without reference populations for standardization were hampered by the presence of transient dynamics before the onset of deterioration, pointing to the importance of reliable baseline data before environmental deterioration begins. The universality of bifurcations in models of population dynamics suggests that this phenomenon should be general10,11,12.},

We used state–space population models and a statistical indicator to detect a transcritical bifurcation extinction threshold in a population of bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) located in an agricultural region experiencing habitat deterioration and loss. The extinction threshold was detectible using two independent data sets. We compared predictions from state–space population models to predictions from a statistical indicator and found that predictions were corroborated. Using state–space population models, we estimated that our study population crossed the extinction threshold in 2010 (2002–2036; 95 \% confidence intervals [CI]) using the whistle count (WC) data set and in 2008 (1999–2064; 95 \% CI) using the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. With the statistical indicator, we estimated that the extinction threshold will be crossed in 2018 (2004–2031; 95 \% CI) using the WC data and will be crossed in 2012 (2006–2018; 95 \% CI) using the BBS data. We expect extinction in our study population soon after crossing the extinction threshold, but the time to extinction and potential reversibility of the threshold are unknown. Our results suggest that neither small nor decreasing population size will warn of the transcritical bifurcation extinction threshold. We suggest that managers of wildlife populations in regions experiencing land use change should try to predict extinction thresholds and make management decisions to ensure the persistence of the species.},

	abstract = {Complex natural systems, spanning from individuals and populations to ecosystems and social-ecological systems, often exhibit abrupt reorganizations in response to changing stressors, known as regime shifts or critical transitions. Theory suggests that such systems feature folded stability landscapes with fluctuating resilience, fold-bifurcations, and alternate basins of attraction. However, the implementation of such features to elucidate response mechanisms in an empirical context is scarce, due to the lack of generic approaches to quantify resilience dynamics in individual natural systems. Here, we introduce an Integrated Resilience Assessment (IRA) framework: a three-step analytical process to assess resilience and construct stability landscapes of empirical systems. The proposed framework involves a multivariate analysis to estimate holistic system indicator variables, non-additive modelling to estimate alternate attractors, and a quantitative resilience assessment to scale stability landscapes. We implement this framework to investigate the temporal development of the Mediterranean marine communities in response to sea warming during 1985–2013, using fisheries landings data. Our analysis revealed a nonlinear tropicalisation of the Mediterranean Sea, expressed as abrupt shifts to regimes dominated by thermophilic species. The approach exemplified here for the Mediterranean Sea, revealing previously unknown resilience dynamics driven by climate forcing, can elucidate resilience and shifts in other complex systems.},

In this paper, we show that changes of the metabolic timescale ratio can cause catastrophic shifts. Then, we investigate a two-dimensional parameter space with the timescale ratio and the carrying capacity of basal species, and reveal that the timescale ratio characterizes the response of the system to environmental variation. Finally, in a bistable regime, we try to clarify the relationship between the trophic position of a species and the extent to which the species induces attractor switching. We saw that, in a 4-species food chain, top predators and second consumers induce attractor switching easily compared to first consumers and basal species.},

However, populations and communities in nature often show more complex dynamics, and regime shifts in the complex dynamic systems have attracted limited attention so far. Understanding the division between alternative stable states in multispecies communities requires an extended perspective and the conventional analysis of a simple equilibrium situation cannot be applied as it is. What divides the alternative stable states can take complex structure rather than a point, and this division of alternative states is usually impossible to be obtained by analytical approaches. In this study, we developed a numerical method that can relatively easily provide the structure of the division of alternative stable states. We then applied the method to different three-species systems exhibiting oscillatory dynamics to understand their recoverability from perturbations that can bring out irreversible state change. Our results suggested that there is temporal variation of the recoverability that may not be understood straightforwardly because of the complex structure of the division of alternative stable states. Also, which of the alternative states is more vulnerable to perturbations and easier to show a regime shift can vary depending on the size of perturbation. These attributes of regime shifts have not been found in a simple equilibrium situation, suggesting the need of a dynamic aspect of the recoverability of ecological systems.},

Time-to-extinction in this experiment was maximized at intermediate levels of habitat fragmentation, which is consistent with a minority of theoretical models. These results provided a baseline for comparison with experimental treatments designed to detect effects of concentrating resources in source patches. These treatments showed that source-sink configurations increased population variability (the coefficient of variation in abundance) and extinction hazard compared with homogeneous environments. These results suggest that where environments are spatially heterogeneous, accurate assessments of extinction risk will require understanding the exchange of organisms among population sources and sinks. Such heterogeneity may be the norm rather than the exception because of both the intrinsic heterogeneity naturally exhibited by ecosystems and increasing habitat fragmentation by human activity.},

This paper describes the further development of the National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model with surface-unsaturated–saturated water processes and land-surface processes assimilated with satellite data to include mutual interaction and feedback of hydrogeologic and vegetation dynamics in the mire. NICE iteratively simulated hydrologic cycle, elevation change, and vegetation succession, including the competition between two vegetation types (alder-dominant shrub forest and reed–sedge vegetation), to evaluate nonlinear relationship between drying and alder invasion in the mire and to examine a method for mire recovery. NICE reproduced well the heterogeneous alder invasion in the mire, implying that the study made some progress in explaining the positive feedback between geomorphology and eco-hydrology on irregular slopes and in heterogeneous vegetation, whereas most previous studies have considered regular slopes and their relation to string or maze patterns. Simulation results predicted that restoring meanders to the river channel would decrease the discharge and sediment loading of the river, increase the groundwater level downstream, and achieve a degree of mire recovery in the future. The heterogeneous vegetation succession is discussed in relation to regime shift in transient simulation. These results suggest the effectiveness of river restoration in conservation plans for mire recovery, and the importance of the process-based model in assessing the linkage of hydrological change and vegetation succession.

Here we demonstrate a useful method that circumvents data limitation and reduces sampling error by combining ecologically similar multispecies time series into one long time series. With this technique, individual ecological time series containing as few as 20 data points can be mined for such important information as (1) significantly improved forecast ability, (2) the presence and location of nonlinearity, and (3) the effective dimensionality (the number of relevant variables) of an ecological system.},

	abstract = {“Regime shifts” are considered here to be low-frequency, 
high-amplitude changes in oceanic conditions that may be especially
pronounced in biological variables and propagate through several trophic
levels. Three different types of regime shift (smooth, abrupt and
discontinuous) are identified on the basis of different patterns in the
relationship between the response of an ecosystem variable (usually
biotic) and some external forcing or condition (control variable). The
smooth regime shift is represented by a quasi-linear relationship
between the response and control variables. The abrupt regime shift
exhibits a nonlinear relationship between the response and control
variables, and the discontinuous regime shift is characterized by the
trajectory of the response variable differing when the forcing variable
increases compared to when it decreases (i.e., the occurrence of
alternative “stable” states). Most often, oceanic regime
shifts are identified from time series of biotic variables (often
commercial fish), but this approach does not allow the identification of
discontinuous regime shifts. Recognizing discontinuous regime shifts is,
however, particularly important as evidence from terrestrial and
freshwater ecosystems suggests that such regime shifts may not be
immediately reversible. Based on a review of various generic classes of
mathematical models, we conclude that regime shifts arise from the
interaction between population processes and external forcing variables.
The shift between ecosystem states can be caused by gradual, cumulative
changes in the forcing variable(s) or it can be triggered by acute
disturbances, either anthropogenic or natural. A protocol for diagnosing
the type of regime shift encountered is described and applied to a data
set on Georges Bank haddock, from which it is concluded that a
discontinuous regime shift in the abundance of haddock may have
occurred. It is acknowledged that few, if any, marine data are available
to confirm the occurrence of discontinuous regime shifts in the ocean.
Nevertheless, we argue that there is good theoretical evidence for their
occurrence as well as some anecdotal evidence from data collection
campaigns and that the possibility of their occurrence should be
recognized in the development of natural resource management strategies.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Wide-scale and sudden shifts in several biological and environmental systems of NW Europe have been reported in recent years, and attributed to a range of factors, both climatic and anthropogenic. To examine whether there is any evidence of coinciding region-wide environmental shifts, we gathered existing long-term data series on a wide range of physical and biological parameters from the 1960s to the present and, following the methods of a similar recent study on North Pacific regime shifts, we analysed the data using principal component analysis and regime shift analysis to identify the extent and timing of regime shifts in NW Europe. The end-point of a regime (i.e. the year) was determined using a sliding window in regime shift analysis. Additionally we applied chronological clustering to the (1) combined data, (2) biological data and (3) environmental data. In all 3 cases, the same regimes were identified. Our results indicate that substantial regime shifts occurred in the marine ecosystem in 1979 and 1988 and perhaps also in 1998, although results were less clear-cut in the latter case. These regime shifts were most evident among the biological data series, but they appeared to have been triggered by earlier shifts in a number of environmental factors. Salinity and weather conditions played an important role in the 1979 shift, while in the 1988 shift, temperature and weather conditions were the predominant factors. Our results confirm those of the North Pacific study, with concomitant changes in physical and biological indices. This indicates a shift in climate–ocean interactions throughout the entire temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere.},

The key elements of this procedure are subsampling and bias correction of the least squares estimate of the serial correlation.

To understand the dynamical mechanism of a tipping point and to predict its occurrence as a system parameter varies are of uttermost importance, tasks that are hindered by the often extremely high dimensionality of the underlying system. Using complex mutualistic networks in ecology as a prototype class of systems, we carry out a dimension reduction process to arrive at an effective 2D system with the two dynamical variables corresponding to the average pollinator and plant abundances. We show, using 59 empirical mutualistic networks extracted from real data, that our 2D model can accurately predict the occurrence of a tipping point, even in the presence of stochastic disturbances. We also find that, because of the lack of sufficient randomness in the structure of the real networks, weighted averaging is necessary in the dimension reduction process. Our reduced model can serve as a paradigm for understanding and predicting the tipping point dynamics in real world mutualistic networks for safeguarding pollinators, and the general principle can be extended to a broad range of disciplines to address the issues of resilience and sustainability.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Increasing numbers of ecosystems globally are at risk of collapse. However, most descriptions of terrestrial ecosystem collapse are post hoc with few empirically based examples of ecosystems in the process of collapse. This limits learning about collapse and impedes development of effective early-warning indicators. Based on multidecadal and multifaceted monitoring, we present evidence that the Australian mainland Mountain Ash ecosystem is collapsing. Collapse is indicated by marked changes in ecosystem condition, particularly the rapid decline in populations of keystone ecosystem structures. There also has been significant decline in biodiversity strongly associated with these structures and disruptions of key ecosystem processes. In documenting the decline of the Mountain Ash ecosystem, we uncovered evidence of hidden collapse. This is where an ecosystem superficially appears to be relatively intact, but a prolonged period of decline coupled with long lag times for recovery of dominant ecosystem components mean that collapse is almost inevitable. In ecosystems susceptible to hidden collapse, management interventions will be required decades earlier than currently perceived by policy makers. Responding to hidden collapse is further complicated by our finding that different drivers produce different pathways to collapse, but these drivers can interact in ways that exacerbate and perpetuate collapse. Management must focus not only on reducing the number of critical stressors influencing an ecosystem but also on breaking feedbacks between stressors. We demonstrate the importance of multidecadal monitoring programs in measuring state variables that can inform quantitative predictions of collapse as well as help identify management responses that can avert system-wide collapse.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}, {\textless}h3{\textgreater}Significance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Almost all descriptions of ecosystem collapse are made after it has occurred and not during the process of collapse. We describe the process of collapse in the iconic Australian Mountain Ash ecosystem. We uncovered empirical evidence for hidden collapse, which occurs when an ecosystem superficially appears to be intact but a prolonged period of decline coupled with long lag times for recovery mean that collapse is almost inevitable. This is because key ecosystem components continue to decline for long periods even after drivers of collapse are removed. Hidden collapse suggests a need for actions well before managers perceive they are required. Long-term monitoring targeting different classes of state variables can be used to provide early warnings of impending collapse.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although shifts in productivity regimes have been described, their frequency and intensity have not previously been assessed. We use a database of trends in harvest and abundance of 230 fish stocks to evaluate the proportion of fish stocks in which productivity is primarily related to abundance vs. those that appear to manifest regimes of high or low productivity. We evaluated the statistical support for four hypotheses: (i) the abundance hypothesis, where production is always related to population abundance; (ii) the regimes hypothesis, where production shifts irregularly between regimes that are unrelated to abundance; (iii) the mixed hypothesis, where even though production is related to population abundance, there are irregular changes in this relationship; and (iv) the random hypothesis, where production is random from year to year. We found that the abundance hypothesis best explains 18.3\% of stocks, the regimes hypothesis 38.6\%, the mixed hypothesis 30.5\%, and the random hypothesis 12.6\%. Fisheries management agencies need to recognize that irregular changes in productivity are common and that harvest regulation and management targets may need to be adjusted whenever productivity changes.},

(2012) Geophys Res Lett 39(2):L02708, 10.1029/2011GL050168]. Although this idea is supported by simulation experiments with general circulation models, additional support from field data are limited. In particular, the Northern Hemisphere network of temperature-sensitive millennial tree-ring chronologies, which principally comprises Eurasian sites, suggests that the strongest eruptions only caused cooling episodes lasting less than about 10 y. Here we present a new network of millennial tree-ring chronologies from the taiga of northeastern North America, which fills a wide gap in the network of the Northern Hemisphere's chronologies suitable for temperature reconstructions and supports the hypothesis that volcanoes triggered both the onset and the coldest episode of the Little Ice Age. Following the well-expressed Medieval Climate Anomaly (approximately A.D. 910–1257), which comprised the warmest decades of the last millennium, our tree-ring-based temperature reconstruction displays an abrupt regime shift toward lower average summer temperatures precisely coinciding with a series of 13th century eruptions centered around the 1257 Samalas event and closely preceding ice-cap expansion in Arctic Canada. Furthermore, the successive 1809 (unknown volcano) and 1815 (Tambora) eruptions triggered a subsequent shift to the coldest 40-y period of the last 1100 y. These results confirm that series of large eruptions may cause region-specific regime shifts in the climate system and that the climate of northeastern North America is especially sensitive to volcanic forcing.},

The growing availability of multidecadal observational records opens new windows on how ocean ecosystems function, but the analysis and interpretation of such long time-series also requires new mathematical tools and conceptual models (2). Population time-series often show strong variations at decadal time-scales, and a central question is whether this arises from nonlinear biological processes or simply tracking of external physical variability (3). Borrowing from climate research, Di Lorenzo and Ohman (4) develop a new approach for deciphering links between physical forcing and biological response, using as a test case time-series of marine zooplankton abundances off the coast of California.

Upwelling favorable winds bring cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface near the coast, supporting the highly productive California Current System. The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (www.calcofi.org) and California Current Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research site (cce.lternet.edu) have sampled a grid of coastal and open-ocean stations since 1950, one of the longest comprehensive marine ecological datasets. Di Lorenzo and Ohman (4) examine two krill species, Nyctiphanes simplex and Euphausia pacifica , large planktonic crustaceans that feed on smaller phytoplankton and microzooplankton, export sinking fecal pellets to depth, and are preyed upon by higher trophic level organisms, fish, marine mammals, and seabirds (Fig. 1). E. pacifica is a resident species in the California Current that exhibits substantial interannual variability tied to rates of coastal upwelling.

Unlike previous studies, I applied three types of distribution to use a regime shift model, i.e., normal, GEV and stable distribution, which allows me to consider a heavy tail regime in the model. From some theoretical basis and empirical results, I find that the regime shift model in stable distribution is best appropriate. I also find that tail index of the innovation and dependence measure move together, implying dependence among a consecutive data may lead extreme event and vice versa.},

	abstract = {The mass extinction events during human prehistory are striking examples of ecological regime shifts, the causes of which are still hotly debated. In Australia, human arrival approximately 50 thousand years ago was associated with the continental-scale extinction of numerous marsupial megafauna species and a permanent change in vegetation structure. An alternative stable state persisted until a second regime shift occurred during the late Holocene, when the largest two remaining marsupial carnivores, the thylacine and devil, disappeared from mainland Australia. These extinctions have been widely attributed to the human-assisted invasion of a competing predator, the dingo. In this unusual case, the simultaneous effects of human “intensification” (population growth and technological advances) and climate change (particularly increased ENSO variability) have been largely overlooked. We developed a dynamic model system capable of simulating the complex interactions between the main predators (humans, thylacines, devils, dingoes) and their marsupial prey (macropods), which we coupled with reconstructions of human population growth and climate change for late-Holocene Australia. Because the strength of important interspecific interactions cannot be estimated directly, we used detailed scenario testing and sensitivity analysis to identify robust model outcomes and investigate competing explanations for the Holocene regime shift. This approach identified human intensification as the most probable cause, while also demonstrating the potential importance of synergies with the effects of climate change. Our models indicate that the prehistoric impact of humans on Australian mammals was not limited to the late Pleistocene (i.e., the megafaunal extinctions) but extended into the late Holocene.},

Unfortunately, it is very difficult to measure ecological resilience in practice. Here we show that the rate of recovery from small perturbations (sometimes called “engineering resilience”) is a remarkably good indicator of ecological resilience. Such recovery rates decrease as a catastrophic regime shift is approached, a phenomenon known in physics as “critical slowing down.” We demonstrate the robust occurrence of critical slowing down in six ecological models and outline a possible experimental approach to quantify differences in recovery rates. In all the models we analyzed, critical slowing down becomes apparent quite far from a threshold point, suggesting that it may indeed be of practical use as an early warning signal. Despite the fact that critical slowing down could also indicate other critical transitions, such as a stable system becoming oscillatory, the robustness of the phenomenon makes it a promising indicator of loss of resilience and the risk of upcoming regime shifts in a system.},

It has been suggested that rapid temporal changes of the most energetic empirical orthogonal function of North Pacific sea surface temperature (sometimes called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation or PDO) represents a “regime shift” between states with otherwise stable statistics. Using random independent time series generated to have the same frequency content as the PDO, we show that a composite analysis of climatic records recently used to identify regime shifts is likely to find them in Gaussian, red noise with stationary statistics. Detection of a shift by this procedure is not evidence of nonlinear processes leading to bi-stable behavior or any other meaningful regime shift.},

We describe the research done on generic abundance-based signals of instability that are derived from the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which represent the genesis of EWSs research. We highlight some of the issues facing the detection of such signals in biological systems – which are inherently complex and show low signal-to-noise ratios. We then document research on alternative signals of instability, including measuring shifts in spatial autocorrelation and trait dynamics, and discuss potential future directions for EWSs research based on detailed demographic and phenotypic data. We set EWSs research in the greater field of predictive ecology and weigh up the costs and benefits of simplicity vs. complexity in predictive models, and how the available data should steer the development of future methods. Finally, we identify some key unanswered questions that, if solved, could improve the applicability of these methods.},

Our approach detected three rapid reorganization events, where changes in the relative abundances of dominant and rare species occurred, and a separate period of increased variance in the structure of the community. These events coincided with time periods, possibly related to climate events, where the total abundance of rodents was extremely low. There are a variety of processes that could link low abundance events with a higher probability of rapid ecological transitions, including higher importance of stochastic processes (i.e., competitive interactions or priority effects) and the removal of structuring effects of competitive dominants or incumbent species. Continued study of the dynamics of community change will provide important information not only on the processes structuring communities, but will also provide guidance for forecasting how communities will undergo change in the future.},

In the face of global change and increasing direct human impacts, there is an urgent need to anticipate and prevent undesirable regime shifts and, conversely, to reverse shifts in already degraded reef systems. Such challenges require a better understanding of the human and natural drivers that support or undermine different reef regimes. The Hawaiian archipelago extends across a wide gradient of natural and anthropogenic conditions and provides us a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between multiple reef regimes, their dynamics and potential drivers. We applied a combination of exploratory ordination methods and inferential statistics to one of the most comprehensive coral reef datasets available in order to detect, visualize and define potential multiple ecosystem regimes. This study demonstrates the existence of three distinct reef regimes dominated by hard corals, turf algae or macroalgae. Results from boosted regression trees show nonlinear patterns among predictors that help to explain the occurrence of these regimes, and highlight herbivore biomass as the key driver in addition to effluent, latitude and depth.},

	abstract = {Many marine ecosystems have undergone ‘regime shifts’, i.e. abrupt reorganizations across trophic levels. Establishing whether these constitute shifts between alternative stable states is of key importance for the prospects of ecosystem recovery and for management. We show how mechanisms underlying alternative stable states caused by predator–prey interactions can be revealed in field data, using analyses guided by theory on size-structured community dynamics. This is done by combining data on individual performance (such as growth and fecundity) with information on population size and prey availability. We use Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and their prey in the Baltic Sea as an example to discuss and distinguish two types of mechanisms, ‘cultivation-depensation’ and ‘overcompensation’, that can cause alternative stable states preventing the recovery of overexploited piscivorous fish populations. Importantly, the type of mechanism can be inferred already from changes in the predators' body growth in different life stages. Our approach can thus be readily applied to monitored stocks of piscivorous fish species, for which this information often can be assembled. Using this tool can help resolve the causes of catastrophic collapses in marine predatory–prey systems and guide fisheries managers on how to successfully restore collapsed piscivorous fish stocks.},

	abstract = {‘Regime shift’ has emerged as a key concept in the environmental sciences. The concept has roots in complexity science and its ecological applications, and is increasingly applied to intertwined social and ecological phenomena. Yet what exactly is a regime shift? We explore this question at three nested levels. First, we propose a broad, contingent, multi-perspective epistemological basis for the concept, seeking to build bridges between its complexity theory origins and critiques from science studies, political ecology, and environmental history. Second, we define the concept in a way that is consistent with this epistemology, building on previous work on speed, scale, stickiness, and interrelationships, but also emphasising human perceptions and rhetorical uses of the notion. Third, we propose a novel typology of the ways in which the regime shift concept is used in analysing social–environmental phenomena in geography and beyond. These uses are categorised along two axes. On the one side, we distinguish between description of past or present changes and normative prescriptions for the future. On the other side, we distinguish between whether the focus is on material shifts (social and ecological) or conceptual shifts (discourses and ideas). We illustrate the typology with reference to social–environmental changes in landscapes around the world that are dominated by plantations or the widespread naturalisation of Australian Acacia species. We conclude that the regime shift concept is a boundary object with value as both an analytical and communicative tool in addressing social–environmental challenges.},

Many reviews and theoretical papers have addressed alternative states or stable states, regime shifts, tipping points and phase shifts, but the empirical evidence for these phenomena, which we refer to as stark changes, has not been evaluated in estuaries and nearshore marine ecosystems. We developed standard definitions for these phenomena and examined the functional forms of ecological responses to environmental pressures (i.e. proximate influences on ecosystem state). We searched for publications related to estuaries and nearshore marine ecosystems that included common descriptors of stark change in their keywords. Our search yielded 376 papers, of which we retained 98 that met four criteria: (1) claimed a stepped biological change; (2) inferred change from empirical data; (3) addressed changes that occurred in one or more semi-enclosed, tidally influenced ecosystems; and (4) described a connection to long-term patterns of ecological change. Although there were many instances of changes in ecological states, most were not stark changes. Evidence generally was not derived from time-series data, and many studies inferred temporal change from spatial differences. We describe the eight studies that provided some evidence of stark changes in ecosystem state. We suggest that compelling evidence of stark changes that can be related to pressures requires concurrent time-series data on the ecological response and pressures that were claimed to induce the stark changes.},

Universality of these early warning signals has been proposed, but no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that in relatively simple ecological models the most commonly used early warning signals for a catastrophic collapse can be silent. We underpin the mathematical reason for this phenomenon, which involves the direction of the eigenvectors of the system. Our results demonstrate that claims on the universality of early warning signals are not correct, and that catastrophic collapses can occur without prior warning. In order to correctly predict a collapse and determine whether early warning signals precede the collapse, detailed knowledge of the mathematical structure of the approaching bifurcation is necessary. Unfortunately, such knowledge is often only obtained after the collapse has already occurred.},

Detecting structural breaks in natural processes, however, turns out to be an ambitious task because the lack of well defined target values and reference periods renders application of standard statistical (process or quality) control methods all but impossible. We develop an iterative procedure combining econometric, time series and quantile methods that produce a graphic display referred to as a “shiftogram,” which indicates potential shifts within univariate components of an ecosystem of interest by characterizing their specific and often fairly complex properties. The shiftogram approach can be routinely applied as a scanning device to any (univariate) time series. We provide a search algorithm that iteratively looks for the best value of some quality-of-fit criterion for a time series where the break point is not known beforehand. The approach is demonstrated by the application to univariate examples of fish recruitment, a climate change phenomenon and a canonical variable bundling the effect of different biodiversity indices. Analysis of ecosystem level shifts (i.e. regime shifts) can then be conducted by applying the shiftogram method to multiple component variables and examining correspondence among their resulting shift point and shift types. Alternatively we illustrate how regime shifts can be examined directly by applying the shiftogram approach to multivariate time series data after reduction to a univariate case through canonical data reduction techniques.},

Theory and controlled experimental studies suggest that the approach to critical points can be anticipated by critical slowing down (CSD), that is, a characteristic slowdown in the dynamics. The validity of this indicator in field ecosystems, where stochasticity is important in driving transitions, remains unclear. We analyze long-term data from a dryland ecosystem in the Shapotou region of China and show that the ecosystem underwent an abrupt transition from a nearly bare to a moderate grass cover state. Prior to the transition, the system showed no (or weak) signatures of CSD but exhibited expected increasing trends in the variability of the grass cover, quantified by variance and skewness. These surprising results are consistent with the theoretical expectation of stochastically driven abrupt transitions that occur away from critical points; indeed, a driver of vegetation—annual rainfall—showed rising variance prior to the transition. Our study suggests that rising variability can potentially serve as a leading indicator of stochastically driven transitions in real-world ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The worldwide decline of wetland ecosystems calls for an urgent reassessment of their current status from a resilience perspective. Understanding the trajectories of changes that have produced the current situation is fundamental for assessing system resilience. Here, we examine long-term dynamics of wetland ecosystem change by reviewing paleoecological records from 11 representative lakes in China. We identify unprecedented change in alga communities in the context of last two centuries. Striking ecological shifts have occurred in all lakes, yet with spatial and temporal differences. The long-term trajectories of change in diatom species composition and structure indicate gradually eroded system resilience. These ecological shifts were shaped by socio-economic activities as China transformed from a rural agricultural to an industrialized society within the last several decades, during which multiple drivers have accumulated and acted synergistically. The balance between ecosystem and society, which appeared to exist for thousands of years, was broken by increasing population, new technology, and urbanization since the 1980s. The consequences are the emergence of new positive feedbacks with the potential to drive the coupled systems into undesirable states. By linking long-term social and ecological change at a regional scale, our study provides a novel contribution to the understanding of lake ecosystems resilience in present-day China. We argue that sustaining wetland ecosystems requires integrated approaches that incorporate a deeper understanding of social-ecological dynamics over decadal-centennial timescales to address the complex underlying mechanisms leading to the current degradation.},

	abstract = {Theory suggests that ecological systems exhibit a pronounced slow down in their dynamics, known as ‘critical slowing down’ (CSD), before they undergo regime shifts or critical transitions. As a result of CSD, ecosystems exhibit characteristic temporal and spatial changes which can be used as early warning signals of imminent regime shifts. For temporal data, statistical methods to detect these generic indicators of ecosystem resilience are well developed. However, for spatial data, despite a well developed theoretical framework, statistical methods such as data pre-processing and null models to detect EWS are relatively poorly developed. In this manuscript, we investigate the case of a common type of ecological spatial dataset which consists of binary values at each location (e.g. occupied/unoccupied, tree/grass or coralline/bleached). We employ a cellular-automaton based spatially-explicit model which generates data that mimics remotely sensed or field collected high-resolution spatial data with a binary classification of the state variables at each location. We demonstrate that trends in two spatial metrics, spatial variance and spatial skewness, of such binary spatial data lead to false, failed or misleading signals of transitions. We find that, two other indicators, spatial autocorrelation at lag-1 and spectral density ratio, accurately reflect CSD even with binary spatial data. To overcome the problems associated with detection of EWS using spatial variance and skewness, we investigate a data pre-processing method called ‘coarse-graining’ which is inspired from the physics literature on phase transitions. Coarse-graining reduces the spatial resolution of data by averaging state variables over small scales. Yet, it enables detection of CSD-based spatial indicators of impending critical transitions. In summary, our study provides a theoretical basis, and rigorous evaluation, of coarse-graining as a pre-processing step to analyse spatial datasets with discrete state classifications.},

Little attention has been paid to the theoretical dynamic consequences of such change-points. Here we propose a change-point model of stochastic population dynamics. This investigation embodies a shift of attention from the problem of detecting when a change will occur, to another non-trivial puzzle: using ecological theory to understand and predict the post-breakpoint behavior of the population dynamics. The proposed model and the explicit expressions derived here predict and quantify how density dependence modulates the influence of the pre-breakpoint parameters into the post-breakpoint dynamics. Time series transitioning from one stationary distribution to another contain information about where the process was before the change-point, where is it heading and how long it will take to transition, and here this information is explicitly stated. Importantly, our results provide a direct connection of the strength of density dependence with theoretical properties of dynamic systems, such as the concept of resilience. Finally, we illustrate how to harness such information through maximum likelihood estimation for state–space models, and test the model robustness to widely different forms of compensatory dynamics. The model can be used to estimate important quantities in the theory and practice of population recovery.},

Their development has given ecologists hope of predicting rapid regime shifts before they occur. Accurate predictions, however, rely on the signals being appropriate to the system in question. Most of the EWS commonly applied in ecology have been studied in the context of one specific type of regime shift (the type brought on by a saddle-node bifurcation, at which one stable equilibrium point collides with an unstable equilibrium and disappears) under one particular perturbation scheme (temporally uncorrelated noise that perturbs the net population growth rate in a density independent way). Whether and when these EWS can be applied to other ecological situations remains relatively unknown, and certainly underappreciated. We study a range of models with different types of dynamical transitions (including rapid regime shifts) and several perturbation schemes (density-dependent uncorrelated or temporally-correlated noise) and test the ability of EWS to warn of an approaching transition. We also test the sensitivity of our results to the amount of available pre-transition data and various decisions that must be made in the analysis (i.e. the rolling window size and smoothing bandwidth used to compute the EWS). We find that EWS generally work well to signal an impending saddle-node bifurcation, regardless of the autocorrelation or intensity of the noise. However, EWS do not reliably appear as expected for other types of transition. EWS were often very sensitive to the length of the pre-transition time series analyzed, and usually less sensitive to other decisions. We conclude that the EWS perform well for saddle-node bifurcation in a range of noise environments, but different methods should be used to predict other types of regime shifts. As a consequence, knowledge of the mechanism behind a possible regime shift is needed before EWS can be used to predict it.},

The potential for such changes is growing due to anthropogenic pressures, which challenges the resilience of societies and ecosystems. Abrupt ecological changes are difficult to diagnose because they can arise from a variety of circumstances, including rapid changes in external drivers (e.g., climate, or resource extraction), nonlinear responses to gradual changes in drivers, and interactions among multiple drivers and disturbances. We synthesize strategies for identifying causes of abrupt ecological change and highlight instances where abrupt changes are likely. Diagnosing abrupt changes and inferring causation are increasingly important as society seek to adapt to rapid, multifaceted environmental changes.},

Because of potential losses to ecosystem services, forecasting such unexpected shifts would be valuable. Using mathematical models of regime shifts, ecologists have proposed various early warning signals of imminent shifts. However, their generality and applicability to real ecosystems remain unclear because these mathematical models are considered too simplistic. Here, we investigate the robustness of recently proposed early warning signals of regime shifts in two well-studied ecological models, but with the inclusion of time-delayed processes. We find that the average variance may either increase or decrease prior to a regime shift and, thus, may not be a robust leading indicator in time-delayed ecological systems. In contrast, changing average skewness, increasing autocorrelation at short time lags, and reddening power spectra of time series of the ecological state variable all show trends consistent with those of models with no time delays. Our results provide insights into the robustness of early warning signals of regime shifts in a broader class of ecological systems.},

Adaptive response to such changes, and planning for their occurrence, requires an understanding of the underlying drivers and system responses as well as appropriate monitoring. In addition to field studies, modelling can advance our ability to anticipate or deal with such major ecosystem shifts. Here, we used an existing multispecies model with smooth continuous functions that were modified to include thresholds representing 3 alternative scenarios of predator responses when prey numbers drop below a critical threshold: (I) no threshold-like response; (II) an abrupt decrease in breeding success by 90\%, and (III) an abrupt halving of adult survival. Second, we analysed field observations from 3 independent marine case studies (abalone, starfish, penguins) for evidence of abrupt non-linear responses of predators to changes in abundance of principal prey. Third, we compared the model output with empirical results and tested (using both a statistical method and by fitting multispecies models) the 3 alternative response scenarios. With this approach, we found evidence for nonlinear changes in population parameters (such as survival rate) of predators as prey numbers declined below critical thresholds. As an example of the potential for this approach to inform management, we found that abundances of a range of marine predators become more variable as prey numbers decline, which may be a useful indicator that a system is approaching a tipping point.},

	abstract = {During the decline to extinction, animal populations may present dynamical phenomena not exhibited by robust populations1,2. Some of these phenomena, such as the scaling of demographic variance, are related to small size3,4,5,6 whereas others result from density-dependent nonlinearities7. Although understanding the causes of population extinction has been a central problem in theoretical biology for decades8, the ability to anticipate extinction has remained elusive9. Here we argue that the causes of a population’s decline are central to the predictability of its extinction. Specifically, environmental degradation may cause a tipping point in population dynamics, corresponding to a bifurcation in the underlying population growth equations, beyond which decline to extinction is almost certain. In such cases, imminent extinction will be signalled by critical slowing down (CSD). We conducted an experiment with replicate laboratory populations of Daphnia magna to test this hypothesis. We show that populations crossing a transcritical bifurcation, experimentally induced by the controlled decline in environmental conditions, show statistical signatures of CSD after the onset of environmental deterioration and before the critical transition. Populations in constant environments did not have these patterns. Four statistical indicators all showed evidence of the approaching bifurcation as early as 110 days (∼8 generations) before the transition occurred. Two composite indices improved predictability, and comparative analysis showed that early warning signals based solely on observations in deteriorating environments without reference populations for standardization were hampered by the presence of transient dynamics before the onset of deterioration, pointing to the importance of reliable baseline data before environmental deterioration begins. The universality of bifurcations in models of population dynamics suggests that this phenomenon should be general10,11,12.},

Our review of a suite of multivariate-based regime shift/early warning indicators provides a broad range of metrics applicable to a wide variety of data types or contexts, from situations where a great deal is known about the key system drivers and a regime shift is hypothesized a priori, to situations where the key drivers and the possibility of a regime shift are both unknown.

However, few studies have looked for discontinuities (clumps of similarly sized species or gaps of sizes that contain no or relatively few species) in pelagic community size structure. We investigated size distribution characteristics in aquatic communities by calculating kernel density functions for plankton and fish in 11 lakes in Wisconsin. Size distributions in aquatic communities of these lakes were not smooth. Rather, multiple lump and gap regions were found within each functional group of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish. Simulations showed the gaps could not be explained by incomplete censuses of species or by systematic underestimation of intraspecific size variation. In an experimentally enriched lake, before and after comparisons showed lumps were not affected by large additions of P and N, even though biomass and production changed substantially. Lump regions in the two lakes with both food web manipulations and nutrient enrichment were substantially less similar pre- versus postenrichment than the reference lake and the lake with only nutrients added, but lump number remained relatively unchanged. Lakes that differed widely in nutrient status, trophic structure, species diversity, and area had similar size distributions. Comparisons of functional groups showed that phytoplankton had more lumps than zooplankton. In these north temperate lakes, size distribution characteristics seem to be conservative properties shaped by common regional ecosystem processes and organism patterns and not by lake-specific factors.},

Here we show that the class of ecological systems that will exhibit leading indicators of regime shifts is limited, and that there is a set of ecological models and, therefore, also likely to be a class of natural systems for which there will be no forewarning of a regime change. We first describe how nonlinearities in combination with environmental variability lead to model descriptions that will not have smooth potentials, concluding that many ecological systems are described by systems without smooth potentials and thus will not show typical leading indicators of regime shifts. We then illustrate the impact of these general arguments by numerically examining the dynamics of several model ecological systems under slowly changing conditions. Our results offer a cautionary note about the generality of forecasting sudden changes in ecosystems.},

These bacteria are either abundant or nearly absent in most individuals, and exhibit decreased temporal stability at the intermediate abundance range. The abundances of these bimodally distributed bacteria vary independently, and their abundance distributions are not affected by short-term dietary interventions. However, their contrasting alternative states are associated with host factors such as ageing and overweight.
