X.ISI.000436855200007,article,"Zan, Yanjun and Carlborg, Orjan",n,A multilocus association analysis method integrating phenotype and expression data reveals multiple novel associations to flowering time variation in wild-collected Arabidopsis thaliana,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,2018,18,798-808,JUL,"The adaptation to a new habitat often results in a confounding between genomewide genotype and beneficial alleles. When the confounding is strong, or the allelic effects is weak, it is a major statistical challenge to detect the adaptive polymorphisms. We describe a novel approach to dissect polygenic traits in natural populations. First, candidate adaptive loci are identified by screening for loci directly associated with the adaptive trait or the expression of genes known to affect it. Then, a multilocus genetic architecture is inferred using a backward elimination association analysis across all candidate loci with an adaptive false discovery rate-based threshold. Effects of population stratification are controlled by accounting for genomic kinship in both steps of the analysis and also by simultaneously testing all candidate loci in the multilocus model. We illustrate the method by exploring the polygenic basis of an important adaptive trait, flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana, using public data from the 1,001 genomes project. We revealed associations between 33 (29) loci and flowering time at 10 (16)degrees C in this collection of natural accessions, where standard genomewide association analysis methods detected five (3) loci. The 33 (29) loci explained approximately 55.1 (48.7)\% of the total phenotypic variance of the respective traits. Our work illustrates how the genetic basis of highly polygenic adaptive traits in natural populations can be explored in much greater detail using new multilocus mapping approaches taking advantage of prior biological information, genome and transcriptome data.",10.1111/1755-0998.12757,1755-098X,1755-0998,ISI:000436855200007,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite the severity of these regime shifts, elucidating the precise nature of their underlying processes has remained difficult. We address this challenge with a new analytic approach to detect and assess the relative strength of different driving processes in food webs. Our study draws on complexity theory, and integrates the network-centric exponential random graph modelling (ERGM) framework developed within the social sciences with community ecology. In contrast to previous research, this approach makes dear assumptions of direction of causality and accommodates a dynamic perspective on the emergence of food webs. We apply our approach to analysing food webs of the Baltic Sea before and after a previously reported regime shift. Our results show that the dominant food web processes have remained largely the same, although we detect changes in their magnitudes. The results indicate that the reported regime shift may not be a system-wide shift, but instead involve a limited number of species.

The majority of these methods define thresholds as the perturbation points causing abrupt ecological response, but in reality most species or ecosystems do not show a break point response but more gradual transitional change to perturbation. We develop a new method which delineates thresholds as a region in which the slope of the relationship between ecological response (y) and perturbation (x; e.g. habitat loss) is larger than 1: vertical bar|dy/dx vertical bar >= 1, where both x-and y-axes are scaled to (0, 1) range. The lower end of threshold zones so defined is of particular ecological interest because it is the smallest x that may trigger impending catastrophic response to a small change in x. We derived two landscape models (edge length and the number of patches of species distribution) and two biodiversity models (endemics-area relationship and half-population curve) to test this method. We applied our zonal thresholding method to these four models fit to empirical data of two forest plots to detect thresholds of species distribution to habitat loss. The two landscape metric models predict that no species could tolerate more than 40\% of habitat loss and these thresholds can be much lower for relatively rare species with occupancy <0.4 and for aggregated habitat loss compared to random habitat loss. The half-population model leads to a similar threshold level of 40\% habitat loss. Overall, we suggest the maximum permissible habitat loss threshold to be between 0-40\%, depending on the pre-disturbed occupancy (or abundance) of a species. This habitat loss threshold falls within the otherwise wide range of thresholds calculated from conventional methods. Our study contributes novel methods and models to quantify the effect of habitat loss on species distribution and diversity in landscapes with potential for conservation applications.",10.1111/ecog.02557,0906-7590,1600-0587,ISI:000394670600012,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Land application is a novel approach to potassium silicate drilling fluid (PSDF) waste recycling, addressing its disposal requirements while potentially improving soil quality for land reclamation. Inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer (0,34 N: 45 P kg ha(-1)) was added with PSDF (0, 30, 45, 60 m(3) ha(-1)) as eight PSDF amendments. PSDF amendments were incorporated or sprayed on four reclamation soils (sand, loam, clay loam 1 and 2). Response to PSDF application was assessed in the greenhouse with two plant species (Hordeum vulgare L. (barley) and Agropyron trachycaulum (Link) Malte (slender wheat grass). PSDF amendments had no detrimental effects on soil quality (macronutrients, pH, salinity, sodicity) and plant growth except in clay loam 2 soil. In loam soil, barley height and biomass were greater with PSDF at 45 m3 ha(-1) with fertilizer relative to soil without PSDF. In sand soil with PSDF at the highest rate without fertilizer, wheat grass height was 1.08 times and biomass was 1.76 times greater than the control. High electrical conductivity in clay loam 2 soil, and decreased density, height and biomass of wheat grass at highest PSDF application rates or with PSDF incorporation, suggest a threshold beyond which conditions are compromised for PSDF application. Increasing PSDF application rate increased soil potassium availability by 1.6-4.1 times relative to no PSDF. This initial research demonstrates that PSDF may be an appropriate soil amendment for agricultural crops and native plant species on land reclamation sites with consideration of substrates properties, plant species tolerances and inorganic fertilizer.

This approach has been applied to classical phylogeographic data sets such as mitochondrial barcodes as well as reduced-genome polymorphism data sets that can yield 10,000s of SNPs, produced by emergent technologies such as RAD-seq and GBS. A strategy for the latter had been accomplished by adapting the site frequency spectrum to a novel summarization of population genomic data across multiple taxa called the aggregate site frequency spectrum (aSFS), which potentially can be deployed under various inferential frameworks including approximate Bayesian computation, random forest and composite likelihood optimization. Here, we introduce the r package multi-dice, a wrapper program that exploits existing simulation software for flexible execution of hierarchical model-based inference using the aSFS, which is derived from reduced genome data, as well as mitochondrial data. We validate several novel software features such as applying alternative inferential frameworks, enforcing a minimal threshold of time surrounding co-demographic pulses and specifying flexible hyperprior distributions. In sum, multi-dice provides comparative analysis within the familiar R environment while allowing a high degree of user customization, and will thus serve as a tool for comparative phylogeography and population genomics.",10.1111/1755-0998.12686,1755-098X,1755-0998,ISI:000415921900018,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The traditional GIS-based approach is criticized for inappropriately specifying geographic units and threshold distances, and for ignoring people's self-movement. This research proposes a novel approach, emphasizing the actual park users' activities, both spatially and temporally. We took advantage of the large dataset available from mobile phones to analyze billions of anonymized data samples in order to characterize the behavioral patterns of millions of people who accessed green space in an experimental procedure. We chose Shanghai as the case study because residential segregation had occurred expected to be accompanied by issues of environmental justice. The results found that social equity could be achieved, even where territorial inequity was manifest in a high-population-density context that is undergoing rapid urban growth and transition.

To prevent drought damage and reduce potential losses, it is important to establish an index to provide support for winter wheat drought monitoring, prevention, and mitigation, and further to understand the precise spatiotemporal characteristics of winter wheat droughts. In this study, meteorological factors, remote sensing products, disaster records, and phenophases of winter wheat in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain were integrated to establish a Crop Drought Identification Index for winter wheat drought disasters. The CDII was expressed as the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions (ELc), in which ETa was simulated through the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model and ETc was calculated based on the Penman-Monteith method using daily meteorological data and MODIS remotely sensed products. The CDII for winter wheat at different developmental stages was formed by establishing the drought sample sequences and determining the thresholds based on a Lilliefors goodness-of-fit test and the upper threshold of a 95\% confidence interval. Validation showed that the identification results by CDII corresponded with 86.2\% drought records. The spatial distributions of drought characteristics for winter wheat in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain were mapped. The thresholds of the CDII at the before wintering stage, returning green-jointing stage, and heading stage were higher than that at the other two developmental stages. Drought frequency was higher across the whole Huang Huai-Hai Plain at the before wintering stage and returning green-jointing stage of winter wheat. The regions with higher drought frequency were concentrated in the northern part of the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain at the heading stage and in the mid-western Shandong Province at the milky ripening physiological maturity stage. This study took the drought distribution in the 2006-2007 growing season and heading stages from 2000 to 2013 as examples, the results indicated that the CDII could identify the actual drought of winter wheat reasonably. The findings indicate the CDII is useful for monitoring and assessing winter wheat drought disasters at a regional scale.

In July 1999, Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data were acquired in northeastern Wyoming, near Devils Tower National Monument. Using the reflectance spectrum of flowering leafy spurge, leafy spurge occurrence was determined using a new method of spectral mixture analysis, Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF). Ground reference data (146 sites) were obtained 2 weeks before and after AVIRIS overflight to test the classification accuracy of leafy spurge. For 3 land cover types: mixed prairie, riparian, and coniferous woodlands, the presence or absence leafy spurge was detected with an overall accuracy of 95\% using a 0.10 threshold for detection. Differences in classification thresholds resulted in a trade-off between false positives, pixels that were mapped as leafy spurge but did not contain leafy spurge on the ground, and false negatives, areas that had leafy spurge on the ground but were not mapped as leafy spurge. Detection of leafy spurge occurrence was best for mixed prairie and riparian cover types, and somewhat less successful for conifer woodlands because of interference from tree crowns and their shadows.

To achieve this, planners need information on how these processes vary across space and time, and how this variation relates to species of conservation interest. This study presents a new method of quantifying variability that captures both between- and within-year changes in variables of interest. We applied this method to remotely-sensed chlorophyll-a in the Coral Sea to find five distinct regimes of variation that serve as surrogates for assemblages of species of conservation interest. We performed a gap analysis to determine protection of the regimes both internationally and nationally within Australia's network of marine reserves in the Coral Sea. We also identified key areas for protection within each regime, in terms of chlorophyll-a variability and species associations, and examined their protection status. Depending on conservation objectives, reserve systems that span multiple national jurisdictions and a rezoning of Australian national waters might be necessary to meet protection requirements for the regimes and for key areas within them. The current suspension and review of the Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve management plans and the recent proclamation of New Caledonia's as yet unzoned Coral Sea Nature Park offer planners an opportunity to incorporate dynamic processes into conservation planning for the Coral Sea.

In northern Australia, the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina) recently invaded semi-arid regions. Here, cane toads endure repeated daily bouts of severe desiccation and thermal stress during the long dry season (April-October). We investigated whether cane toads have shifted their ancestral nocturnal rehydration behaviour to one that exploits water resources during the day. Such a shift in hydration behaviour could increase the fitness of individual toads by reducing exposure to desiccation and thermal stress suffered during the day even within terrestrial shelters. We used a novel method (acoustic tags) to monitor the daily hydration behaviour of 20 toads at two artificial reservoirs on Camfield station, Northern Territory. Remarkably, cane toads visited reservoirs to rehydrate during daylight hours, with peaks in activity between 9.00 and 17.00. This diurnal pattern of rehydration activity contrasts with nocturnal rehydration behaviour exhibited by adult toads in their native geographical range and more mesic parts of Australia.

However, currently available methods for detecting regime shifts depend on having multiple long time series data from both before and after the regime shift. This data requirement is prohibitive for many ecosystems. Here, we present a new approach for detecting regime shifts from one-dimensional spatial (transect) data from just a single time step either side of the transition. Characteristic length scale (CLS) estimation is a method of attractor reconstruction combined with nonlinear prediction that enables identification of the emergent scale at which deterministic behavior of the system is best observed. Importantly, previous studies show that a fundamental change in ecosystem dynamics, from one domain of attraction to another, is reflected in a change in the CLS, i.e., the approach enables distinguishing regime shifts from variability in dynamics around a single attractor. Until now the method required highly resolved two-dimensional spatial data, but here we adapted the approach so that the CLS can be estimated from one-dimensional transect data. We demonstrate its successful application to both model and real ecosystem data. In our model test cases, we detected change in the CLS in cases where the shape (topology) of the interaction network had changed, leading to a shift in community composition. In an examination of benthic transect data from four Indonesian coral reefs, changes in the CLS for two of the reefs indicate a regime shift. This new development in estimating CLSs makes it possible to detect regime shifts in systems where data are limited, removing ambiguity in the interpretation of community change.",10.1002/ecm.1312,0012-9615,1557-7015,ISI:000449887100012,4,NA,"Wotherspoon, Simon/0000-0002-6947-4445 Johnson, Craig/0000-0002-9511-905X Ward, Delphi/0000-0002-1802-2617",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition to their interest in comparing different management systems on an indicator by indicator basis, land managers are often interested in comparing individual indicators against a threshold, or, in order to study trade-offs, against each other. To this end it is necessary to (1) transform the original indicators into a comparable format, and (2) score these transformed indicators against a sustainability function. This paper introduces an evaluation method for land-use-related impact indicators, which was designed to accomplish these tasks. it is the second of a series of two papers, and as such it links into a larger framework for sustainability assessment of land use systems. The evaluation scheme introduced here comprises (1) a standardisation procedure, which aims at making different indicators comparable. In this procedure indicators are first normalised, by referencing them to the total impact they contribute towards, and then they are corrected by a factor describing the severity of this total impact in terms of exceeding a threshold. The procedure borrows conceptually from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Impact Analysis methodology; (2) a valuation procedure, which judges the individual standardised indicators with regard to sustainability. This methodology is then tested on an indicator set for the environmental impact of a spinach production system in Northwest Germany. The method highlights mineral resource consumption, greenhouse gas emission, eutrophication and impacts on soil quality as the most important environmental effects of the studied system. We then explore the effect of introducing weighting factors, reflecting the differing societal perception of diverse environmental issues. Two different sets of weighting factors are used. The influence of weighting is, however, small compared to that of the standardisation procedure introduced earlier. Finally, we explore the propagation of uncertainty (defined as a variable's 95\% confidence limits) throughout the standardisation procedure using a stochastic simulation approach. The uncertainty of the analysed standardised indicator was higher than that of the non-standardised indicators by a factor of 2.0 to 2.5. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, work in several large mammal species suggests that the width of cementum light bands in teeth decline once females begin to reproduce, suggesting that teeth structures might provide a new tool to examine AFR. To determine if changes in cementum light band width could be used to calculate AFR for the northern sea otter (Enhydra lutris kenyoni), we measured cementum light band widths on sectioned premolar teeth and compared them to reproductive tracts. We classified otters as parous if any single light band was narrower than a threshold value, selected as the value that minimized error rates. At a threshold value of 0.32, we correctly identified otters as parous, or nulliparous in 83\% of cases (n = 92) as compared to reproductive tracts, and the AFR estimated from teeth samples (3.52 +/- 0.032 yr) was not different from that determined by reproductive tract analysis (3.45 +/- 0.031 yr; t-test, P > 0.05). These data support the use of cementum as an indicator of past reproduction in individual female otters, which can then be used to estimate average AFR. Given that declines in cementum width have been described for other mammal species, the same quantitative approach used here could be applied to other species.",10.2193/2007-218,0022-541X,1937-2817,ISI:000254412800006,3,NA,"von Biela, Vanessa/0000-0002-7139-5981 Burns, Jennifer/0000-0001-9652-2943","Burns, Jennifer/C-4159-2013 ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nature conservation and restoration traditionally focus on protecting individual sites. In parts of the world where the natural landscape has been severely altered for agricultural or urban use, individual patches are too small and isolated to ensure effective nature protection. Spatial processes, such as metapopulation dynamics, are disrupted and natural linkages in the landscape, such as water flows, are severed by modifications in the landscape and hydrology. 2. We propose the identification of Operational Landscape Units (OLUs), which are defined as combinations of landscape patches with their hydrogeological and biotic connections, as a tool to facilitate wetland restoration in catchments with a high degree of fragmentation and strongly altered hydrology. The combined consideration of biotic (i.e. dispersal, transports of organisms) and hydrological connections (flooding events, groundwater flowpaths) is a new approach. 3. We developed criteria for the delineation of OLUs in regional wetland restoration initiatives. The key elements for delineation are definition of the restoration objectives, identification of spatial landscape mechanisms and information on historic and present land uses and hydrologic management. 4. As a case study, we delineated an OLU by applying these criteria in a restoration initiative for a large agricultural area that used to be a floodplain until the early 1950s in N.E. Twente, The Netherlands. The OLU encompassed not only the floodplain area to be restored but also a relatively remote nature reserve upstream as well as the stream connecting both areas. By restoring the historic water regime, flooding events would become a regular feature in the two areas and organisms including seeds would flow from the nature reserve to the restored floodplain. 5. Synthesis and applications. Discussions of the proposed Operational Landscape Units with stakeholders (water authorities, nature conservation agencies, farmers) resulted in shared insights which will lead to modifications of the original management plan for the area. We believe the OLU approach will make natural resource managers aware of the importance of spatial processes and connectivity in landscapes and.. if properly applied, will lead to more natural and more successful restoration projects.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01534.x,0021-8901,NA,ISI:000259788100022,5,NA,"Janssen, Ron/0000-0001-6257-3507 Soons, Merel/0000-0002-6130-6359","Janssen, Ron/L-1346-2013 Soons, Merel/C-6216-2009 Verhoeven, Jos/B-9514-2011 ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These open water ponds are critical habitat for millions of birds annually and restoration program managers must determine the appropriate balance between retention of ponds versus re-conversion to tidal salt marsh, knowing that both are essential ecosystems for endangered bird species. Our study describes the ecological value of the new open water pond ecosystems as feeding habitats for birds. We used the oxygen rate of change method to determine ecosystem metabolic parameters from high resolution time-series of dissolved oxygen concentration. Areal gross primary production (8.17 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) was roughly double the world's most productive estuaries. High rates of phytoplankton photosynthesis were balanced by equally high rates of community respiration (8.25 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)). Metabolic equilibrium was delicately poised; sharp irradiance and temperature shifts triggered short term photosynthesis reduction resulting in oxygen depletion. We converted net primary production (NPP) into potential carrying capacity of the forage biota that support targeted pond waterbirds. NPP was processed through both a pelagic food web, resulting in forage biota for piscivorous birds and a benthic food web, resulting in forage biota for shorebirds and diving benthivores. Both food webs included efficient algal-based and inefficient detrital trophic pathways. The result of all primary production being routed through simple food webs was high potential forage production and energy supply to waterbirds, equivalent to 11-163 million planktivorous fish or 19-78 billion small estuarine clams within the 330-ha pond between May and October. food quantity does not necessarily equal quality and these systems have the potential to produce toxic or inedible algae.

This is logical for social carnivores, which rely exclusively on meat for energy, but arguably not for omnivores, which obtain calories from either plant or animal matter. The common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, is one of the few true omnivores that regularly hunts in groups. Studies to date have yielded conflicting data regarding the payoffs of group hunting in chimpanzees. Here, we interpret chimpanzee hunting patterns using a new approach. In contrast to the classical assumption that hunting with others maximizes per capita caloric intake, we propose that group hunting is favored because it maximizes an individual's likelihood of obtaining important micronutrients that may be found in small quantities of meat. We describe a mathematical model demonstrating that group hunting may evolve when individuals can obtain micronutrients more frequently by hunting in groups than by hunting solitarily, provided that group size is below a certain threshold. Twenty five years of data from Gombe National Park, Tanzania are consistent with this prediction. We propose that our `meat-scrap' hypothesis is a unifying approach that may explain group hunting by chimpanzees and other social omnivores.",10.1007/s00265-008-0676-3,0340-5443,NA,ISI:000261955100012,3,NA,"Tennie, Claudio/0000-0002-5302-4925",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and other reduced-representation DNA sequencing (RRS) protocols (e.g., RADseq, ddRAD) have enabled the analysis of genetic data on an unprecedented scale. Here, we present a novel approach for the discovery and statistical validation of sex-specific loci in GBS data sets. We used GBS to genotype 166 New Zealand fur seals (NZFS, Arctocephalus forsteri) of known sex. We retained monomorphic loci as potential sex-specific markers in the locus discovery phase. We then used (i) a sex-specific locus threshold (SSLT) to identify significantly male-specific loci within our data set; and (ii) a significant sex-assignment threshold (SSAT) to confidently assign sex in silico the presence or absence of significantly male-specific loci to individuals in our data set treated as unknowns (98.9\% accuracy for females; 95.8\% for males, estimated via cross-validation). Furthermore, we assigned sex to 86 individuals of true unknown sex using our SSAT and assessed the effect of SSLT adjustments on these assignments. From 90 verified sex-specific loci, we developed a panel of three sex-specific PCR primers that we used to ascertain sex independently of our GBS data, which we show amplify reliably in at least two other pinniped species. Using monomorphic loci normally discarded from large SNP data sets is an effective way to identify robust sex-linked markers for nonmodel species. Our novel pipeline can be used to identify and statistically validate monomorphic and polymorphic sex-specific markers across a range of species and RRS data sets.",10.1111/1755-0998.12767,1755-098X,1755-0998,ISI:000428335900001,2,NA,"Rutherford, Kim/0000-0001-6277-726X Black, Michael/0000-0003-1174-6054","Rutherford, Kim/Y-7995-2018 ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For migratory species, in particular, it is also essential to consider the extent of spatial synchrony among separate breeding populations in range-wide predictions. We develop a quantitative method to evaluate the accuracy of climate-based ecological predictions and use this approach to assess the extent of spatio-temporal synchrony among distinct regions within the breeding range of a single migratory population. Location We model weekly site-specific summer abundances (1996-2011) of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in the Midwestern USA as a function of climate conditions experienced during a shared spring migration/ breeding phase in Texas and separate summer recruitment periods in Ohio and Illinois. Methods Using negative binomial regression models, we evaluate spatio-temporal synchrony between monarchs in the two states and develop a novel quantitative assessment approach to determine the temporal predictive strength of our model with Bayesian P-values. Results Monarchs breeding in the Midwest exhibit spatio-temporal synchrony in Ohio and Illinois; cooler spring temperatures, average to above average precipitation in Texas and cooler than average summer temperatures are associated with higher population abundances in both states. At least 10 years of data are needed for adequate model predictability of average future counts. Because annual spring weather conditions in Texas primarily drive yearly abundances, as opposed to localized summer effects, year-specific counts are often difficult to predict reliably, specifically when predictive spring conditions are outside the range of typical regional conditions. Main conclusions Our assessment method can be used in similar analyses to more confidently interpret ecological responses to climate change. Our results demonstrate the relative importance of climatic drivers in predicting abundances of a migratory species and the difficulties in producing reliable predictions of animal populations in the face of climate change.",10.1111/geb.12461,1466-822X,1466-8238,ISI:000383517000007,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the optimum network structure that is required for solving a particular problem is still an active area of research. In the past, several network pruning methods based on weight magnitude or sensitivity have been proposed and some example are magnitude based pruning (MBP) (Hagiwara, 1993); optimal brain damage (OBD) and its variants (Cun et al., 1990); and variance nullity (Engelbrecht, 2001). For example, in MBP, weights that are small are removed. How small is `small' is a subjective decision. In OBD, weights that are not important for input-output mapping are found and removed. This is based on a saliency measure, si of a weight, as given in Eq. 1, that is an indication of the cost of setting it to zero. The larger the si, the greater the influence of w(i) on error. It is computed from the Hessian (H) which is the matrix containing the second derivative of error with respect to a pair of weights in the network. s(i) = H-ii w(i)(2) / 2 (1) Saliency threshold however, is a subjective decision. Variance nullity measure proposes a variance analysis of the sensitivity of the output of the network to perturbation of weights. It is based on a hypothesis test using chi(2) (chi square) distribution to test statistically if a weight should be pruned. Here, null variance threshold must be defined. Teoh et al. (2006) proposes singular value decomposition (SVD) of hidden neuron activation to determine correlated neuron activations in order to select the required number of hidden neurons; however, the method requires heuristic judgment in setting up of a threshold parameter in the criteria for determining the optimum number of neurons. Xian et al. (2005) proposes an approach that utilizes the knowledge of the shape of the target function to determine the optimum number of neurons. This approach is efficient for 2- or 3-dimensional data where the shape of the target function can be ascertained relatively easily. However, the method cannot be applied to high-dimensional data as the target function cannot be visualized for such data. Another approach for optimising network structure is genetic and evolutionary algorithms (Castillo et al., 2000; Yao, 1999) that involve extensive and time consuming search, and in comparison to other network optimisation methods, these provide the least insight into the operation of a network. In this paper, a new method based on the correlation of the weighted activation of the hidden neurons combined with the Self Organisation Feature Maps is presented for obtaining the optimum network structure efficiently. In an extensive search for internal consistency of hidden neuron activation patterns in a network, it was found that the weighted hidden neuron activations feeding the output neuron(s) displayed remarkably consistent patterns. Specifically, redundant hidden neurons exhibit weighted activation patterns that are highly correlated. Therefore, the paper proposes identifying hidden neurons with weighted activation patterns that are highly correlated and using one neuron to represent a group of correlated neurons. The paper proposes to automate this process in two steps: 1) Map the correlated weighted hidden neuron activation patterns onto a self organising map; and 2) Form clusters of SOM neurons themselves to find the maximum likely number of clusters of correlated activity patterns. The likely number of clusters on the map indicates the required number of hidden neurons to model the data.

The former is typically regarded as the capacity of a community to return to an original equilibrium state after a perturbation in species abundances and is usually linked to the strength of interspecific interactions. The latter is the capacity to sustain positive abundances on all its constituent species and is linked to both interspecific interactions and species demographic characteristics. Over the last 40years, theoretical research in ecology has emphasized the search for conditions leading to the dynamical stability of ecological communities, while the conditions leading to feasibility have been overlooked. However, thus far, we have no evidence of whether species interactions are more conditioned by the community's need to be stable or feasible. Here, we introduce novel quantitative methods and use empirical data to investigate the consequences of species interactions on the dynamical stability and feasibility of mutualistic communities. First, we demonstrate that the more nested the species interactions in a community are, the lower the mutualistic strength that the community can tolerate without losing dynamical stability. Second, we show that high feasibility in a community can be reached either with high mutualistic strength or with highly nested species interactions. Third, we find that during the assembly process of a seasonal pollinator community located at The Zackenberg Research Station (northeastern Greenland), a high feasibility is reached through the nested species interactions established between newcomer and resident species. Our findings imply that nested mutualistic communities promote feasibility over stability, which may suggest that the former can be key for community persistence.",10.1002/ece3.1930,2045-7758,NA,ISI:000371069800011,4,NA,"Rohr, Rudolf Philippe/0000-0002-6440-2696 Bascompte, Jordi/0000-0002-0108-6411 Olesen, Jes/0000-0002-6712-2702","Rohr, Rudolf Philippe/K-9232-2015 Bascompte, Jordi/B-7596-2008 ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The phosphorus (P) bound in its crystal lattice is considered to be immobilised because vivianite is stable under anoxic, reducing, sedimentary conditions. Thus, vivianite formation can make a major contribution to P retention during early diagenesis. Much remains unknown about vivianite in sediments, because technical challenges have rendered direct identification and quantification difficult. To identify vivianite and assess its significance for P burial during early diagenesis we studied the consequences of a 1992/1993 in-lake application of FeCl3 and Fe(OH)(3) aimed at restoring Lake Gro beta-Glienicke (Berlin, Germany). In a novel approach, we firstly applied a heavy-liquid separation to the iron-rich surface sediments which allowed direct identification of vivianite by X-ray diffraction in the high-density (rho > 2.3 g cm(-3)) sediment fraction. Secondly, we assessed the contribution of vivianite to P retention, combining results from chemical digestion with magnetic susceptibility data derived from magnetic hysteresis measurements. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the dark blue spherical vivianite nodules were 40-180 mu m in diameter, and formed of platy- and needle-shaped crystal aggregates. Although equilibrium calculations indicated supersaturation of vivianite throughout the upper 30 cm of the sediment, the vivianite deposits were homogeneously distributed within, and restricted to, the upper 23 cm only. Thus, supersaturated pore water alone can-not serve as a reliable predictor for the in situ formation of vivianite.

The method is intended for application on rivers wherein the conservation of native aquatic biodiversity and protection of natural ecosystem functions are primary river management objectives. 2. The RVA uses as its starting point either measured or synthesized daily streamflow values from a period during which human perturbations to the hydrological regime were negligible. This streamflow record is then characterized using thirty-two different hydrological parameters, using methods defined in Richter et al. (1996). Using the RVA, a range of variation in each of the thirty-two parameters, e.g. the values at +/- 1 standard deviation from the mean or the twenty-fifth to seventy-fifth percentile range, are selected as initial flow management targets. 3.

In the present article, I introduce a new approach for ancestral character estimation for discretely valued traits. This approach is based on the threshold model from evolutionary quantitative genetics. Under the threshold model, the value exhibited by an individual or species for a discrete character is determined by an underlying, unobserved continuous trait called ``liability.{''} In this new method for ancestral state reconstruction, I use Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample the liabilities of ancestral and tip species, and the relative positions of two or more thresholds, from their joint posterior probability distribution. Using data simulated under the model, I find that the method has very good performance in ancestral character estimation. Use of the threshold model for ancestral state reconstruction relies on a priori specification of the order of the discrete character states along the liability axis.

However, effects of herbicides on non-target terrestrial plants are primarily studied on the level of individual plants neglecting interactions between species. In our study, we aim to extrapolate individual-level effects to the population and community level by adapting an existing spatio-temporal, individual-based plant community model (IBC-grass). We analyse the effects of herbicide exposure for three different grassland communities: 1) representative field boundary community, 2) Calthion grassland community, and 3) Arrhenatheretalia grassland community. Our simulations show that herbicide depositions can have effects on non-target plant communities resulting from direct and indirect effects on population level. The effect extent depends not only on the distance to the field, but also on the specific plant community, its disturbance regime (cutting frequency, trampling and grazing intensity) and resource level. Mechanistic modelling approaches such as IBC-grass present a promising novel approach in transferring and extrapolating standardized pot experiments to community level and thereby bridging the gap between ecotoxicological testing (e.g. in the greenhouse) and protection goals referring to real world conditions.

Identifying the urban-rural fringe accurately is of great significance, as it helps to measure the extent of urbanization and its environmental effects from the urban-rural contrast perspective. However, traditional studies with spatial discrete data and threshold methods make it difficult to identify its boundary objectively and accurately. To solve this problem, a new approach was proposed in this study, integrating the spatial continuous data of impervious surface area (ISA) and the method of spatial continuous wavelet transform (SCWT). Taking Beijing City, one of the largest city in China, as a case, this study identified the boundary of urban-rural fringe, which extended mainly in the southwestern and northeastern direction, with the area increased by 18.75\% between 2009 and 2014. The accuracy of the identification result was verified by spatial differentiation characteristics of nighttime light and normalized difference vegetation index. Meanwhile, when compared with the subjective threshold method, it showed that SCWT could identify the fringe more accurately. And the ISA based identification result was more consistent with the actual spatial patterns of urban development in Beijing City than land use degree index based one, which showed the remotely sensed spatial continuous data performed more effectively well on identifying the urban-rural fringe. The proposed approach can identify the urban-rural fringe directly from remote sensing images, which is of great significance to quickly urbanization monitoring and thus sustainable urban planning and management.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.03.008,0169-2046,1872-6062,ISI:000431748200007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The research at Lake Glumso is closely linked to the development of ecological modelling as a discipline, inspired a wide range of related working approaches as well as advancements in ecological modelling and the development in ecological theory. In the early working phase, models based on differential equations were used not only to describe the lake processes but also to methodologically identify the optimal formalisation of the described processes. First, modelling applications were continuously improved, thus providing a large body of functional representations for the different compartments. A result of the intense discussions of the early model structures was a new approach called structural dynamic modeling which allowed for varying numbers of variables and a model structure that could change during simulation time. Continuing the search for optimal trade-off between model complexity on one side and efficiency and precision on the other side, machine learning techniques were applied to find out, whether this could help to identify the most reasonable model structures which were tested with Lake Glumso data and many other lakes world wide. In further contributions to ecological theory, the question was tackled whether overall ecosystem characteristics, like exergy, biomass production or species composition, do converge in a successional process towards optimal values. This led to the development of ecosystem goal functions, which was part of an international ecosystem research debate on the theoretical patterning and the dynamics of ecosystems.

In this methodology, the risk in port navigation is assessed on the basis of a combination of the probability of exceedance of a pre-set threshold for the ship's vertical movements and its consequences. To test the new procedures, a set of sea wave records obtained at the Sines wave-buoy from 1988 to 2002 was transferred into Sines Port using two numerical models of sea wave propagation and deformation (SWAN and DREAMS), included in the GUIOMAR system.

E. and Bishop, B.",n,One Model or Three: Integrating Social and Biophysical Scientific Models,NA,2007,NA,NA,NA,"Researchers and practitioners in the field of natural resource management (NRM) have a plethora of simulation models and other tools at their disposal. Modellers themselves are often confronted with the need to make trade-offs between ``the demands of a general theoretical approach and the descriptive accuracy required to model a particular phenomenon{''} (p. 4, Pyka and Grebel, 2003). As efforts are made to conduct integrated assessments, the tension in this area is exacerbated because of the complexity of system interactions and range of disciplinary perspectives. One approach that is proffered as providing substantial promise for incorporating the human dimension in participatory NRM is agent based modelling. Agent-based models (ABM) enable individual agents or groups to `behave' according to a set of rules or constraints. In multi-agent simulations, real-world patterns such as land use/land cover change, resource use or afforrestation patterns are emulated. Companion modelling attempts to better emulate system outcomes by using informants to characterise the `behaviours' of agents in a role playing game. While these techniques may provide insight into the impact of decisions in constructed environments, practitioners acknowledge the significant effort required to characterise or program agents or groups of agents so that an adequate representation of adaptation processes occur. As stated by Bousquet and Le Page (2004) ``the challenge has been to develop a new approach focusing more on the interactions between ecological and social components and taking into account the heterogeneity of these components{''} (p. 315). In this paper, we describe an alternative approach to participatory NRM that utilises an interactive modelling/partnership methodology that avoids the complexity of trying to characterise human behaviour in a computer system. The case study is drawn from our experiences in the Central West of New South Wales in Australia, with the Partnerships and Understanding Towards Targeted Implementation project (PUTTI). PUTTI is a partnership project between Catchment Management Authorities (CMAs), landholders, the broader community and researchers at CSIRO. It draws on the strengths of several complementary analytical techniques to develop a process that integrates across scale (individual farm to catchment) to identify and target the drivers that influence people's land management practices. Each approach provides insight into the dynamics of the decision-making processes of landholders, their social networks, and the underlying motivations and factors that influence the way they manage their properties. A change program for sustainable land management will be developed in close partnership with the community and the CMA. In the first phase, a scoping study has informed the development of a survey carried out with dryland farmers in the Bell and Cudgegong sub-catchments. Structural equation modelling is used to develop a preliminary model of the key drivers influencing their land management practices. In the second modelling activity, selected respondents from the behavioural survey are interviewed and social network analysis used to determine the nature and extent of the contacts they use to gain information about farming practice and related issues. Finally, we intend to work with colleagues involved in modelling of key biophysical processes operating at the regional to local scale to conduct workshops with the catchment community in ways that utilise the social systems and networks and targets the key behavioural drivers. All stages involve in-depth individual and group discussions (shed meetings) with landholders and others to explore and gain a greater understanding of the meaning of the empirical data.

Novel environments are likely to have imposed hominids a demographic challenge due to such factors as higher predation risk and scarcer food resources. In fact, recent studies have found a paucity of older relative to younger adults in hominid fossil remains, indicating considerably high adult mortality in australopithecines, early Homo, and Neanderthals. It is not clear to date why only human ancestors among all hominoid species could survive in these harsh environments. In this paper, we explore the possibility that hominids had shorter interbirth intervals to enhance fertility than the extant apes. To infer interbirth intervals in fossil hominids, we introduce the notion of the critical interbirth interval, or the threshold length of birth spacing above which a population is expected to go to extinction. We develop a new method to obtain the critical interbirth intervals of hominids based on the observed ratios of older adults to all adults in fossil samples. Our analysis suggests that the critical interbirth intervals of australopithecines, early Homo, and Neanderthals are significantly shorter than the observed interbirth intervals of extant great apes.

Simple analytic solutions for the number of alleles maintained at equilibrium and the expected proportion of alleles shared between demes at various levels are derived and checked against simulation results. The theory accurately captures the dynamics of allele number in a subdivided population and identifies important values of m (migration bate) at which allele number and distribution change qualitatively. Starting from a panmictic population, as migration among demes decreases a qualitative change in dynamics is seen at approximately m(crit) approximate to (s/4 piN(T))(1/2), where N-T is the total population size and s is a measure of the strength of selection. At this point, demes can no longer maintain their panmictic allele number, due to increasing isolation from the total population. Another qualitative change occurs at a migration rate on the same order of magnitude as the mutation rate. u. At this point, the demes are highly differentiated for allele complement. and the total number of alleles in the population is increased. Because in general u much less than m(crit), at intermediate migration rates slightly fewer alleles may be maintained in the total population than are maintained at panmixia. Within this range, total allele number may not be the best indicator of whether a population is effectively panmictic, and some caution should be used when interpreting samples from such populations.

Here Ne propose a new method for the evaluation of past caribou activity using tree-ring records from boreal and subarctic conifer stands. The age-frequency distributions of trampling scars produced by caribou hooves on surficial roots and low branches of erect and stunted conifers are used as an index of the passage of caribou through stands during the snow-free period. To verify if changes in the age structure of trampling scars correspond to changes in abundance of caribou movement, we analyzed factors influencing production and loss of scars at tyro lichen-woodland sites in northeastern Quebec-Labrador (Canada). The detailed analysis of trampling scars in the first site indicates that the capacity of conifers to produce scars is maintained under a regime of repeated caribou traffic scars were formed at new positions along the exposed roots and scars continued to be produced at a same position in a minimum time of one growing season, even after 15 years of caribou traffic. The influence of repeated caribou trampling on loss of scars was measured by comparing the age structure of scars of three vegetation groups (based on caribou trail network) with different intensities of use. The similarity of the age structures of the three groups showed that scar loss due to trampling was hardly detectable, which indicated that scar loss was low in comparison to the number of scars produced, even in the most used trails. Sampling of trampling scars during two successive years at the second site showed that the stability of the age structure of scars was nor affected by moderate caribou traffic. Our results, therefore, indicate that most of the information deduced from the age structures of trampling scars comes from changes in caribou activity.

This new approach consisted of traditional multivariate analysis (e. g. canonical redundancy analysis) using an explanatory matrix composed of original and lagged environmental variables, and the performance of this analysis was assessed by comparison with traditional univariate time-lag analysis. Both the univariate and multivariate time-lag analyses showed similar results, but the multivariate approach had advantages and is presented as a useful and uncomplicated alternative to conduct time-lag analysis using a multivariate ecological dataset. Marine and estuarine recruitment processes were better explained by lagged temperature (predominant lags of 1 and 2 mo, respectively) than by in-phase (i.e. time lag = 0) temperature. In contrast, other environmental variables (transparency, salinity and freshwater outflow) did not show significant delays. Hence, our findings show that the species response to environmental variables is not immediate, especially for temperature. Rather, the time lag elapsed between the changes in abiotic factors and juvenile abundance is mediated by ecological and hydrological processes.

We introduce a framework for predicting traits that are likely to confer success in a given ecosystem. Our approach considers the prevailing environmental conditions, the traits of resident species, and the traits of potentially invading species. 3. Our approach can be applied to ecosystems where the environmental conditions and/or disturbance regime have recently changed, to predict the range of trait space occupied by (i) native species at risk of local extinction, (ii) native species that can persist under the present conditions, and (iii) successful invaders. Our approach can also be used to identify unoccupied viable trait space (i.e. vacant niches) that might be at risk of invasion. 4. Synthesis. Understanding invasions resulting from rapid changes in environmental conditions and invasions resulting from the colonization of vacant niches would be a major step forward for invasion biology.

We assessed 2 commonly used methods for estimating decapod larval supply, plankton net tows and artificial settlement substrates (ASS), together with a new technique using passive-migration traps. The aim was to evaluate how these methods estimate larval supply and settlement of 3 common decapod species (the shore crab Carcinus maenas L., the brown shrimp Crangon crangon L, and the grass shrimps Palaemon spp.) in a microtidal nursery area on the Swedish west coast. and to assess how these estimates relate to the juvenile recruitment of these species. Discrete plankton net tows outside the shallow nursery area collected a higher proportion of larvae at an early development stage, compared to the other methods. and produced only a snapshot of the variable water-column abundance of shore crab and grass shrimp larvae that correlated poorly with numbers collected with ASS at the same location. Artificial settlement substrates appeared to produce good, integrated relative estimates of shore crab larval supply and settlement. The number of larvae collected from ASS correlated significantly with larval abundance estimated by passive-migration traps in shallow nursery areas, and reflected changes in shore crab settlement densities in caged mussel habitats. We did not detect any effect of predation on ASS placed in nursery areas. However, a large proportion tan estimated 83\%) of shore crab postlarvae appeared to emigrate from ASS immersed for periods longer than 12 h, possibly during the night. All grass shrimp larvae appeared to emigrate from the collectors within 24 h, suggesting that ASS immersed longer than 12 h do not produce useful integrated estimates of larval supply for this species. These results demonstrate the importance of assessing postlarval emigration patterns from ASS to optimize immersion and collection time, and to avoid confounded estimates of larval abundance and settlement. PI new method using replicated passive migration traps that fished continuously in opposite directions ton-shore and off-shore) gave promising integrated estimates of net fluxes (total number immigrating minus number emigrating per unit time) of both pelagic postlarvae and early benthic juvenile stages of crabs and shrimp. The majority of the brown shrimp recruits were young juveniles, demonstrating the importance of incorporating juvenile migration in recruitment studies of motile benthic species. High numbers of shore crab and grass shrimp larvae were found to emigrate from the bay, indicating that many decapod postlarvae found in nursery areas may be transitional. The emigrating larvae were on average in an earlier development stage than those migrating to the bay.

One suggested way of tackling this problem is to use Full-Inversion Tillage (FIT) where the fertile top-soil is moved below infertile subsurface layers. This should provide infertile conditions at least in the short- to medium-term for the establishment of communities that require these conditions. Here, we pioneer a rigorous test of the efficacy of this approach. Our new method, using Principal Response Curves (PRCs), overcomes the difficulty in testing for change in soil physico-chemical properties down soil profiles with the inherent problem of autocorrelations between soil layers. Principal Response Curves (PRCs) is a multivariate technique, usually used to test for effects of treatment effects through time on a community matrix. We propose an extension of their use for the multivariate analysis of properties down a soil-depth profile. We tested the effects of FIT in two contrasting soils, before and after treatment. In a clay loam soil, FIT was effective in reducing the soil fertility in the surface 12 cm. Indeed the soil available P concentration, a key variable, was more than halved in the surface layers, and was below the lowest literature target threshold for the establishment of semi-natural grassland. In contrast, in the sandy soil, soil properties increased throughout the profile after FIT, primarily because of the pre-treatment nutrient distribution within the soil. Before FIT treatment, the maximum concentrations of most measured variables were at mid-depth and FIT redistributed these to the surface and bottom layers. Our results demonstrate the potential for FIT in ecological restoration, but indicate that its efficacy depends on soil type and the site history. We recommend that in future a pre-treatment assessment of soil properties with depth is undertaken before FIT is implemented, and that afterwards our PRC approach can be used to test efficacy immediately after treatment, and has the potential for measuring soil resilience to perturbation through time.

However, the notion of urban and rural varies from one country to another. Some nations classify settlements into urban and rural according to a population threshold, others according to prevailing professions in the community and another method is from a social aspect. The Egyptian State's method to classify urban and rural communities depends on the Ministry of Interior (MoI) decrees based primarily on population numbers along with other factors like the existence of certain land uses. Within this context, the research pinpointed some ambiguous facts related to that classification. Hence, the current study is pursuing a new method to address this issue. This is to be done by constructing a composite index (CI) that ranges from 0-1 with a threshold value of 0.5 where the lower values are considered rural and the higher are inferred to as urban.

However, little is known about the factors (genetic, prenatal, postnatal) generating this similarity. Here we analyzed potential influences on the dispersal patterns of multiple families of hatchling fence lizards, Sceloporus occidentalis. We captured near-term females from the field, incubated their eggs in the laboratory, measured various traits of the hatchlings and dams, and then released the hatchlings at a number of sites in nature. We recaptured hatchlings 5-6 weeks later and measured the direct distance to the release site. Because we treated hatchlings (from eggs to release) randomly with respect to sibship, we eliminated the possibility that any observed sibling similarity in dispersal is merely an artifact of common postnatal influences. To analyze dispersal, we developed a new method that does not make an arbitrary choice of a threshold distance separating dispersers from nondispersers. We found a significant family effect on dispersal. We suspect that this family effect originates from genetic influences rather than from prenatal ones. Indeed, hatchling dispersal was remarkably unrelated to numerous traits (of clutches, mothers, or hatchlings) that might reflect prenatal effects. However, we did find that males were more likely to disperse than females, as predicted for polygynous species.

Growing goose numbers put strong grazing pressure on agricultural pastures. Damage to agricultural land may be mitigated by managing nature reserves in order to optimally accommodate large numbers of grazing geese. Livestock grazing has been shown to facilitate foraging geese; we take the novel approach of determining the effects of four different livestock grazing treatments in a replicated experiment on the distribution of geese. We present experimental field evidence that livestock grazing of a salt marsh in summer affects the habitat preference of foraging geese during autumn and spring staging. In an experimental field set-up with four different livestock grazing treatments we assessed goose visitation through dropping counts, in both autumn and spring. Grazing treatments included 0.5 or 1 horse ha(-1) and 0.5 or 1 cattle ha(-1) during the summer season. The livestock grazing regime affected goose distribution in autumn, just after livestock had been removed from the salt marsh. In autumn, goose visitation was highest in the 1 head ha(-1) grazing treatments, where grazing intensity by livestock was also highest. In line with this result, goose visitation was lowest in the 0.5 head ha(-1) livestock grazing treatments, where the grazing intensity by livestock was lowest. The differences in goose visitation among the experimental treatments in autumn could not be explained by the canopy height. In spring we did not find any effect of livestock grazing treatment on goose visitation. Differences in the distribution of geese over the experiment between autumn and spring may be explained by changes in the availability of nutrient-rich vegetation. Livestock summer grazing with a high stocking density, especially with horses, can be used to attract geese to salt marshes in autumn and potentially reduces damage caused by geese to inland farmland. From a nature conservation interest point of view, however, variation in structure of the vegetation is a prerequisite for other groups of organisms. Hence, we recommend grazing of salt marshes with densities of 0.5 head ha(-1) of livestock when goose conservation is not the only management issue.",10.2981/wlb.13046,0909-6396,1903-220X,ISI:000341701300001,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To evaluate the progress of research in leaf photosynthesis, plant respiration, root nutrient uptake, and carbon partitioning, we divided scientific activities into four phases: (I) initial assessments derived from our existing knowledge base to provide frameworks for experimental studies; (II) experimental tests of the initial assessments; (III) in cases where assessments were invalidated, synthesis of experimental results to stimulate alternative hypotheses and further experimentation; and (IV) formation of new knowledge. This paper suggests that photosynthetic research may have gone through all four phases, considering that (a) variable responses of photosynthesis to {[}CO2] are generally explainable, (b) extrapolation of leaf-level studies to the global scale has been examined, and (c) molecular studies are under way. Investigation of plant respiratory responses to {[}CO2] has reached the third phase: experimental results have been accumulated, and mechanistic approaches are being developed to examine alternative hypotheses in search for new concepts and/or new quantitative frameworks to understand respiratory responses to elevated {[}CO2]. The study of nutrient uptake kinetics is still in the second phase: experimental evidence has contradicted some of the initial assessments, and more experimental studies need to be designed before generalizations can be made. It is quite unfortunate that we have not made much progress in understanding mechanisms of carbon partitioning during the past two decades. This is due in part to the fact that some of the holistic theories, such as functional balance and optimality, have not evolved into testable hypotheses to guide experimental studies. This paper urges modelers to play an increasing role in plant-CO2 research by disassembling these existing theories into hypotheses and urges experimentalists to design experiments to examine these holistic concepts.",10.1046/j.1365-2486.1999.00215.x,1354-1013,NA,ISI:000078792600002,2,NA,"wang, yingping/0000-0002-4614-6203 ","wang, yingping/A-9765-2011 Reynolds, James/G-6364-2010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We present a novel method (COMMUSTIX) to determine all stable fixpoints of the general LVC model with abundances x from a given pool of n species. To that purpose, we split the species in potentially surviving species (x(i) > 0) and in others going extinct (x(i) = 0). We derived criteria for the stability of x(i) = 0 and for the equilibrium of x(i) > 0 to determine possible combinations of extinct and surviving species by iteratively applying a mixed binary linear optimization algorithm. We tested this new method against (a) the numerical solution at equilibrium of the LVC ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and (b) the fixpoints of all combinations of surviving and extinct species (possible only for small n), tested for stability and non-negativity. The tests revealed that COMMUSTIX is reliable, it detects all multiple stable fixpoints (SFPs), which is not guaranteed by solving the ODEs, and more efficient than the combinations method. With COMMUSTIX, we studied the dependence of the fixpoint behavior on the competition strengths relative to the intra-specific competition. If inter-specific competition was considerably lower than intra-specific competition, only globally SFPs occurred. In contrast, if all inter-specific was higher than intra-specific competition, multiple SFPs consisting of only one species occurred. If competition strengths in the species pool ranged from below to above the intra-specific competition, either global or multiple SFPs strongly differing in species composition occurred. The species richness over all SFPs was high for pools of species with similar, either weak or strong competition, and lower for species with dissimilar or close to intra-specific competition strengths. The new approach is a reliable and efficient tool for further extensive examinations of the dependence of community compositions on parameter settings of the LVC model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, most existing methods for evaluating the accuracy of presence-absence (binary) predictions of species require presence-absence data. The aim of this study is to present a new method for accuracy assessment that does not rely on absence data. Two new statistics Fpb and Fcpb were derived based on presence-background data. With generated six virtual species, we used DOMAIN, generalized linear modeling (GLM), and maximum entropy (MAXENT) to produce different species presence-absence predictions. To investigate the effectiveness of the new statistics in accuracy assessment, we used Fpb, Fcpb, the traditional F-measure (F), kappa coefficient, true skill statistic (TSS), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the contrast validation index (CVI) to evaluate the accuracy of predictions, and the behaviors of these accuracy measures were compared. The effectiveness of Fpb for threshold selection and estimation of species prevalence was also investigated. Experimental results show that Fcpb is an estimate of F. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (COR) between Fcpb and F is 0.9882, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.0171. In general, Fpb, Fcpb, F, kappa coefficient, TSS, and CVI can sort models by the accuracy of binary prediction, but AUC is not appropriate to evaluate the accuracy of binary prediction. For DOMAIN, GLM, and MAXENT, finding the threshold by maximizing Fpb and by maximizing F result in similar accuracies. In addition, the estimation of species prevalence based on binary output with maximizing Fpb as the thresholding method is significantly more accurate than simply averaging the original continuous output. The best estimate of prevalence is provided by the binary output of MAXENT, with an RMSE of 0.0116. Finally, we conclude that the new method is promising in accuracy assessment, threshold selection, and estimation of species prevalence, all of which are important but challenging problems with presence-only data.

Given the heterogeneous nature of urban landscape, an implicit assumption should be considered in remotely sensed LST determinations that a mixed urban land cover aggregation is the combination of its constituent components. Currently, the common LST retrieval method which utilize emissivity measures estimated by NDVI threshold method (NDVITHM), including mono window (MW), single channel (SC), and split window algorithms (SW), does not take into account heterogeneity of pixels. While in this study, a new approach, the mixture analysis of emissivity (MAoE), is proposed to calculate temperature by estimating pixel emissivity from mixed land cover classes. We conduct a comparison of six approaches by the combinations of three LST retrieval algorithms with NDVITHM and MAoE respectively. The differences among strategies are characterized and analyzed by comparing LST estimates from Landsat 8 thermal images. The LST gradients derived from transect analysis are found consistently similar for combinations of two LST algorithms (MW and SC) and the two emissivity estimation algorithms (MAoE and NDVITHM). LSTs derived from SW algorithms using band 10 have the highest mean values, while the SC algorithms have moderate mean values and the MW algorithms have the lowest values. Standard deviations of estimated LST from MAoE are smaller compared with NDVITHM methods, SC retrieval algorithm with MAoE has the smallest standard deviation, and NDVITHM temperature estimation could be more impacted by different land use land cover types.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.07.010,0169-2046,1872-6062,ISI:000444927200006,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous studies focus on using landscape pattern metrics to interpret the phase of the landscape. A critical but underinvestigated aspect is that these five phases are also spatially explicit processes. This study proposes a new method to map and measure the different spatially explicit processes of landscape fragmentation. Unlike previous studies that are based on landscape pattern metrics, this current study measures landscape change directly. The new method is applied to Bao'an District in Shenzhen, China, to investigate forest land fragmentation under rapid urbanization. Landsat data were used to map the land use distributions from 1978 to 2009. Results show that different spatial processes occur simultaneously throughout the study area as well as in different study periods of forest fragmentation. Shrinkage was the dominant spatial process in the early period. In the later period, subdivision played a more important role, followed by attrition. Interestingly, urban land was not the leading land use that directly encroached on forest land, as many other studies have shown. Instead, forest land was first converted to orchard land, and orchard land was converted to urban land. The study contributes to Forman's general model of spatially explicit processes of landscape fragmentation and holds implications for urban planning policy and practice. The study concludes that the new method is effective in understanding and assessing forest land fragmentation, especially in the context of rapid urbanization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These paddock trees potentially represent important natural habitat elements within the agricultural matrix for a variety of fauna, in particular birds. However, the numbers of paddock trees are declining rapidly in many areas which threaten the biodiversity values of these landscapes. To study the importance of these trees for bird species richness (sampled in 120 sites), we mapped isolated trees and forest cover from Landsat7 and SPOT 5 images using a combination of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), spatial filtering and threshold values. The results of the isolated trees map were verified visually using measures of omission and commission based on a high resolution (2.5m) pseudo natural colour SPOT image on which individual trees could be clearly distinguished. A high level of accuracy (80\%-90\%) was achieved in deriving a layer of trees represented as point objects in areas with low-medium tree cover. The overall percent cover of isolated trees and forests as mapped from the combined map of isolated trees and the classified Landsat image explained 60\% of the variability of the foliage projective cover (FPC) as digitized from the high resolution (2.5m) SPOT images. Various discrete and continuous landscape metrics were calculated based on the tree and forest mapping. These included traditional landscape metrics available within Fragstats software, as well as continuous landscape metrics which were based on spatial filtering and distance from and within patches. The relevance of both types of metrics for bird richness was analysed according to functional groups of birds (woodland and non-woodland). Remotely sensed forest cover at spatial scales between 0.03 and 0.28 km(2) was found to explain almost 50\% of the variability in overall bird richness and 60\% of the variability in woodland bird richness. However, paddock trees and small patches of trees or forest did not contribute to the explanation of the spatial variability in overall avian richness. The work provides a novel approach to investigating the ecological relevance of small and isolated landscape features, such as paddock trees, for bird species richness.

This study aims to develop a new method for assigning rarity weights to species in evaluations of the relative rarity of arthropod assemblages in conservation/monitoring studies. 2. A flexible characteristic was included in the rarity weighting method by introducing the possibility of fitting the method to a rarity cut-off point defined as the threshold of occurrence below which species are considered as being rare. This allows calculation of a rarity metric (index of relative rarity IRR) with multiple rarity cut-off points. 3. The proposed weighting method was used and compared with three previously proposed methods in a theoretical analysis. IRR values were then calculated for spider assemblages of a National Nature Reserve in France. Two methods of rankings were proposed: a local ranking between sites of the Nature Reserve, and a regional ranking in comparison to a reference database. 4. The proposed weighting method consistently weighted species according to the chosen rarity cut-offs. Species weights were less biased toward common species and rare species weights were less dispersed than with previous methods. Assemblages were consistently ranked according to the rarity of spiders in each assemblage. The index showed different patterns of rarity in assemblages which could not be detected by previous rarity metrics. 5.

Yet existing modelling approaches struggle to adequately take fine-scale features and threshold dynamics of dispersal behaviour into account, in part because of computational limitations. We present a framework for modelling connectivity at fine spatial resolutions over large spatial extents. Our framework involves a novel approach to characterising fine-scale dispersal behaviour within the context of existing modelling methods, and uses key parameters of dispersal behaviour to link models and their interpretation at multiple scales. We address computational limitations by creating a gap-crossing threshold layer, which identifies areas where dispersal is possible because of the presence and spacing of fine-scale connectivity elements. This layer is combined with a dispersal-cost layer within a graph-network analysis to identify the optimal least-cost path between patches. Graph metrics are used to assess the importance of specific patches at the regional-scale and to describe connectivity for the whole landscape. A local-scale connectivity model using the Circuitscape software complements the regional analysis outputs by considering all possible pathways across a landscape simultaneously rather than a single least-cost path. The framework was designed specifically to be applied by land use planners who need to quantify the impacts of property development on fine-scale connectivity, yet need to assess implications at the regional scale. We demonstrate the framework by applying it in the Lower Hunter region, Australia. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A contracting threshold hypothesis,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,2010,69,2213-2223,15-Sep,"This paper argues that GDP growth in both developed and developing countries has associated costs that can outweigh the benefits and thus reduce sustainable well-being. This conclusion is based upon the findings of empirical applications of the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) to a range of countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The studies conducted on seven Asia-Pacific countries indicate that, in the case of five of the seven nations, more recent GDP growth has reduced the sustainable well-being experienced by the average citizen residing within them. Moreover, the threshold point at which the costs of GDP growth outweigh the benefits appears to be contracting (i.e., occurring at a much lower per capita level of GDP). This paper therefore introduces a new contracting threshold hypothesis: as the economies of the Asia-Pacific region and the world collectively expand in a globalised economic environment, there is a contraction over time in the threshold level of per capita GDP. As a consequence, the threshold point confronting growth late-comers (i.e., developing countries) occurs at a much lower level of sustainable welfare than what wealthy nations currently enjoy. The consequences of this for developing countries are clearly significant and require a new approach to economic development.

This method is based on hydromorphological river types. Using available maps and field surveys, it determines potential reference sites for establishing reference conditions, and subsequently, on the basis of an assessment of anthropogenic impacts using set criteria, it identifies stream reference sites. Reference sites and river types are validated using field survey data. This method also identifies characteristics of channel pattern, flow, riverbed structures, sediment, and variability of cross-sectional profiles used for establishing type-specific hydromorphological reference conditions. Reference conditions can be expressed using threshold values of individual characteristics (e.g., channel slope, entrenchment ratio, specific stream power); they can also be described qualitatively, that is, verbally (e.g., channel pattern, valley type). Nonetheless, reference conditions are always an expression of a set of characteristics or conditions that should be valid for a given river type. One of the expected results of applying this method is the creation of a reference site database for assessing hydromorphological status of streams.

However, the association between degree of predation risk and prey reproductive strategies has not been clearly established. We examined reproduction in the sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna) from small tidal tributaries in a subtropical estuary. Our results revealed a gradient along which females produced many, small offspring at one extreme (mean = 42 offspring, 17 mg each) and fewer, larger offspring at the other (24 offspring, 29 mg each). Reproductive allotment ranged from 14.9-21.5\% of maternal biomass. Based on our observation of divergent reproductive strategies, we experimentally tested the null hypothesis of no difference in predation risk among tributaries using a novel quantitative approach to estimate predation. We predicted greater risk in tributaries where mollies produced many, small offspring. Tethering confirmed increasing risk from 16.2 +/- 5.3\% SE to 54.7 +/- 3.6\% fish lost h(-1) across sites in agreement with observed variation in reproduction. Predation was unexpectedly higher than predicted at one of the four sites suggesting that additional factors (e.g., food) had influenced reproduction there. Our results provide insight into the well-studied concept of predator-mediated variation in prey reproduction by quantitatively demonstrating differential risk for mollies exhibiting divergent reproductive strategies. While the observed range of variation in reproductive traits was consistent with previous studies reporting strong predator effects, higher than expected predation in one case may suggest that the prey response does not follow a continuous trajectory of incremental change with increasing predation risk, but may be better defined as a threshold beyond which a significant shift in reproductive strategy occurs.",10.1007/s00442-011-2117-7,0029-8549,1432-1939,ISI:000301706800014,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The components of the maximum additive heritability are found via the correlations ``parent-offspring{''} in vivarium population. The interannual phenotypical variability of natural rodent populations is studied in the space of these components. It is shown that radical genetic restructuring in the population takes place in the phase of low density. The genetic specificity of different cycles of vole population dynamics is confirmed as well. The changes of common animals sizes associated with population dynamics are determined by heterozygosity effects.,10.1134/S1995425511040151,1995-4255,NA,ISI:000298609700015,4,NA,"Efimov, Vadim/0000-0003-3035-8049 Nazarova, Galina/0000-0001-8067-7596","Efimov, Vadim/K-5806-2012 ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ozone exposure is expressed as AOT40 (Accumulated exposure Over a Threshold of 40 ppb O-3) as well as PODY (Phytotoxic Ozone Dose above a threshold Y). A new method is suggested to express how the length of the period during the year when coniferous and evergreen trees are sensitive to ozone might be affected by climate change. Ozone precursor emission changes from the RCP4.5 scenario were combined with climate simulations based on the IPCC SRES A1B scenario and used as input to the Eulerian Chemistry Transport Model MATCH from which projections of ozone concentrations were derived. The ozone exposure of vegetation over Europe expressed as AOT40 was projected to be substantially reduced between the periods 1990-2009 and 2040-2059 to levels which are well below critical levels used for vegetation in the EU directive 2008/50/EC as well as for crops and forests used in the LRTAP convention, despite that the future climate resulted in prolonged yearly ozone sensitive periods. The reduction in AOT40 was mainly driven by the emission reductions, not changes in the climate. For the toxicologically more relevant POD1 index the projected reductions were smaller, but still significant. The values for POD1 for the time period 2040-2059 were not projected to decrease to levels which are below critical levels for forest trees, represented by Norway spruce.

Much attention has been paid to population-level risk assessment, but there have been no attempts to determine a safe population-level concentration as an environmental criterion. Based on the published results of toxicity tests for various species, we first theoretically derived a threshold concentration at which a population size is unchanged due to the adverse effects of zinc exposure. To derive a zinc concentration that will protect populations in natural environments, we adopted the concept of species sensitivity distribution. Assuming the threshold concentrations of a set of species are log-normally distributed, we calculated the 95\% protection level of zinc (PHC5 :population-level hazardous concentration of 5\% of species), which is 107 mu g/L. Meanwhile, the 95\% protection criterion (HC5) based on conventional individual-level chronic toxicity, was calculated to be 14.6 mu g/L.

Reduced m.c. delayed radicle protrusion and reduced the fraction of germinated seeds. At 33\% m.c, fresh weight basis (f.w) no radicle protrusion was seen even after a prolonged period at +4 degrees C. Germination capacity (GC), and mean time to germination (MGT), were calculated from seeds prechilled at eight m.c, levels for different durations and then germinated at 25 degrees C. Reduced m.c, resulted in a decrease in the rate of dormancy breaking, quantified as a lower increase in GC or lower reduction in MGT during the first weeks of prechilling, The critical lower m.c. threshold for dormancy breaking was around 23\%. Combining the results it was concluded that prechilling of Abies nordmanniana seeds at a controlled m.c. of 33\% allowed the release of dormancy in all seeds in the seedlot without any germination during the prechilling treatment.

Dividing the reproduction cycle into the three steps - gamete formation, fertilization, and migration - we develop a new approach for computing quasi equilibrium formulas for F-ST (and G(ST)). Our formulas generalize earlier ones and reveal that the equilibrium value of F-ST is influenced not only by the migration rate and local effective population size, N-e, but also by the local census size N, particularly so when the migration rate is high. The order of migration and fertilization is found to have a smaller effect on F-ST. A major advantage compared to previous approaches is that stochastic allele frequency of migrants is easily accommodated, thereby avoiding underestimation of F-ST for large migration rates.

Such rare events are called here long-distance dispersal. The framework of TurbSeed includes three main modules: (1) A turbulence model (TM) for a specified location and time period using meteorological parameters from publicly available mesoscale weather models or simulated climate data. (2) A Lagrangian model (LM) which calculates the seed transport in the turbulent boundary layer and (3) A module which considers the effect of weather conditions on release of seeds (RS). In this approach the turbulent field is prescribed by a coarse wind field derived from the mesoscale climate simulations superimposed by a random velocity component. Similar approaches are known as Eulerian-Lagrangian approaches.The main difference in this new approach (TM) lies in the construction of the turbulent structure of the wind field. The introduction of such a random velocity component uses the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. An inverse random phase Fast-Fourier-Transformation reconstructs the time structure of turbulence using a parameterized power spectrum of turbulence which is accepted as standard in micro meteorology. In the LM module Monte-Carlo-Simulations for numerous trajectories are used to incorporate the effects of turbulence. The RS module takes into account various conditions of release of plant seeds, such as the date of maturity of the seeds and the effect of wind speed on the release of seeds. This model can be driven not only with data from observed weather conditions, but also with output of mesoscale climate scenarios. Thus. TurbSeed can study the effect of climate change on wind dispersal of seeds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The question of stability over time is particularly interesting for frogs because it is not clear to what extent frogs exist in dynamic metapopulations with frequent extinction and recolonization, or in stable patches at equilibrium between drift and gene flow. In this study we collected tissue samples from the same five populations of leopard frogs, Rana pipiens, over a 22-30 year time interval (11-15 generations). Genetic structure among the populations was very stable, suggesting that these populations were not undergoing frequent extinction and colonization. We also estimated the effective size of each population from the change in allele frequencies over time. There exist few estimates of effective size for frog populations, but the data available suggest that ranid frogs may have much larger ratios of effective size (N-e) to census size (N-c) than toads (bufonidae). Our results indicate that R. pipiens populations have effective sizes on the order of hundreds to at most a few thousand frogs, and N-e/N-c ratios in the range of 0.1-1.0. These estimates of N-e/N-c are consistent with those estimated for other Rana species. Finally, we compared the results of three temporal methods for estimating N-e. Moment and pseudolikelihood methods that assume a closed population gave the most similar point estimates, although the moment estimates were consistently two to four times larger. Wang and Whitlock's new method that jointly estimates N-e and the rate of immigration into a population (m) gave much smaller estimates of N-e and implausibly large estimates of m. This method requires knowing allele frequencies in the source of immigrants, but was thought to be insensitive to inexact estimates. In our case the method may have failed because we did not know the true source of immigrants for each population. The method may be more sensitive to choice of source frequencies than was previously appreciated, and so should be used with caution if the most likely source of immigrants cannot be identified clearly.",NA,0014-3820,NA,ISI:000225357600014,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Advances in molecular biology and biochemistry are rapidly identifying and characterizing the components of the clock. However, its function inside the cell is not well understood, and the mechanism by which it affects fitness is unknown. This paper presents a simulation modeling study that combines existing systems biology models of basic intracellular mechanisms (e.g. DNA replication), photosynthesis, post-translational oscillator and transcriptional/translational feedback loop with an agent-based systems ecology model of individual cells (a new approach called ``systems bioecology{''}). The model is calibrated against and can reproduce the major observed features of the clock, including entrainment to light/dark (LD) cycles, free-running rhythms, phase shifts by dark pulses and KaiC protein dynamics. The observed decrease of the free-running period (FRP) with light intensity (Aschoff's Rule) emerges unexpectedly in the model. This behavior of the model can be eliminated by changing how the ribosome concentration varies with the growth rate, consistent with the observed behavior of an IdpA mutant, which suggests a role for that gene. The model predicts the observed fitness advantage of wild-type and period mutants when the FRP and LD periods match. The mechanism in the model is higher amplitude (resonance) of the clock, which leads to stronger expression of photosynthesis genes and growth rate. This may be the mechanism actually responsible for the fitness effect in this case, but it does not explain the existence of the circadian clock from an evolutionary perspective.

I report here on the accuracy and efficiency of this novel technology, compare it with two alternative methods, namely boat-based ultrasonic tracking and Argos Platform Transmitter Terminals (PTTs), and provide new data on the vagility and habitat selection of green turtles in shallow coastal foraging habitat. I used a combined FGPS receiver and P-IT transmitter (Sirtrack, Havelock North, New Zealand) mounted together with an ultrasonic transmitter and time-depth recorder in a tether-attached housing that allowed automatic detachment and subsequent retrieval of the equipment without the requirement to recapture turtles. With this equipment I conducted short deployments (4.5 to 16.8 d) on 3 free-living adult-size green turtles in coastal foraging habitat in Queensland, Australia. In addition, stationary tests in air and afloat were conducted at the same site. FGPS location error (mean +/- SD) increased as the number of satellites used in each computation decreased, from 26 m +/- 19.2 (8 satellites) to 172 m +/- 317.5 (4 satellites). During live tracking the frequency of FGPS locations greatly exceeded Argos PTT, such that screened data comprised about 50 times more FGPS locations despite a much tighter screening threshold for FGPS (250 m) than for Argos PTT (1000 m). FGPS locations showed the three study turtles used modest short-term activity ranges with Minimum Convex Polygon area mean +/- SD 662 ha +/- 293.9. They all remained within <4.7 km of their capture-release locations and favoured shallow water, with 86\% of locations at charted depths <= 3 m and the deepest location at 5.9 m. Fine-scale movements of each turtle varied from day to day with respect to tortuosity and areas traversed. Statistically significant day-night differences were evident in average rates of movement (greater by day) and in habitat selection, where diurnal locations had greater seagrass density while nocturnal locations featured deeper bathymetry. Individual turtles revisited some of their centres of activity (identified from 50\% fixed kernel utilisation distributions) on multiple occasions but none of the study turtles travelled consistently between the same day-night pair of sites as has been reported elsewhere. Such disparity and the day-to-day variation in movements revealed by these short-term findings highlight the need for detailed tracking over longer periods at multiple locations.

We first propose, in an attempt to characterize the `photosynthetically active biomass' of the epipelic community, a new approach to describe the photic environment at the sediment surface, by substituting a discrete a-layer model in place of continuous vertical light distribution. This concept thus allows us to build a functional representation of the distribution of the photosynthetically active biomass in the sediment and, by then integrating the light and temperature forcing of the latter biomass, to predict the dynamics of the whole epipelic community on short-term time scales. The model then clearly reveals an oscillatory behavior of the total biomass at the surface of the sediment, consistent with field biomass daily measurements performed during a spring-neap tidal cycle. Biomass increases occur during the diurnal emersion phase, in alternation with decreases during the submersion and nocturnal emersion phases; the dynamics of intertidal microphytobenthos is thus controlled by the night/day cycle and tidal hydrodynamic forcing, which determines the fast changes in environmental conditions (light and nutrient availability, temperature) which epipelic microalgae experience.

Fire is a contagious and highly unpredictable process, and an analysis of fire connectivity that incorporates stochasticity may help predict fire likelihood across large extents. We developed a model of fire connectivity based on electrical circuit theory, which is a probabilistic approach to modeling ecological flows. We first parameterized our model to reflect the synergistic influences of fuels, landscape properties, and winds on fire spread in the lower Sonoran Desert of southwestern Arizona, and then defined this landscape as an interconnected network through which to model flow (i.e., fire spread). We interpreted the mapped outputs as fire likelihood and used historical burned area data to evaluate our results. Expected fire effects were characterized based on the degree to which future fire exposure might negatively impact native plant community recovery, taking into account the impact of repeated fire and major vegetation associations. We explored fire effects within habitat for the endangered Sonoran pronghorn antelope and designated wilderness. Model results indicated that fire likelihood was higher in lower elevations, and in areas with lower slopes and topographic roughness. Fire likelihood and effects were predicted to be high in 21\% of the currently occupied range of the Sonoran pronghorn and 15\% of the additional habitat considered suitable. Across 16 designated wilderness areas, highest predicted fire likelihood and effects fell within low elevation wilderness areas that overlapped large fire perimeters that occurred in 2005. As ongoing changes in climate and land cover are poised to alter the fire regime across extensive and ecologically important areas in the lower Sonoran Desert, an analysis of fire likelihood and effects can contribute new and important information to fire and fuels management.

The geographic distributions of plant species show marked correlations with the current climate, suggesting that they are likely to shift if climate changes. However, before projecting any such shifts, it is important to establish whether distributions are at equilibrium with the current climate. If they are not, distributional shifts could occur even without climate change, making it difficult to tease apart climate-induced shifts from shifts occurring naturally without climate change. 2. We forecast the geographical distributions of the 10 most common trees occurring in the Iberian Peninsula using a new method that relaxes the species-climate equilibrium assumption implicit in most species distributions models. For each species, we developed a spatially explicit patch occupancy model (SPOM) with climate-dependent extinction rates and with colonization rates that depend on both climate and local seed dispersal. Bayesian methods were used to estimate the colonization, extinction and seed dispersal functions against observed colonization and extinction events recorded in repeat surveys of 46 596 forest plots in the Spanish Forest Inventories (1986-96 and 1997-2007). We then simulated distributional changes between the years 2000-2100. 3. Without climate change, 9 of the 10 species substantially increased in regional frequency. These increases occurred primarily within current ranges, although some species also expanded across their range edges.

A computer algorithm, the K-Maximum Subarray (K-MSA), is applied for the first time to investigate the maximum relationship between the total New Zealand population of suicide deaths (1983-2002) by age group, with four selected social factors; number of bankruptcies, unemployed people, divorces, and orphans and unsupported child beneficiaries, respectively. The range of ages from 5 to 80 years is divided into five-year groups, plus a ``more than 85 years old{''} group. Social factors are classified into four classes (low, med, high and very high) based on their quartile ranges. The advantage of using the K-MSA algorithm is that it detects threshold values (which age groups associate most with social factors) by maximising the sum of the elements of selected subarrays of a two-dimensional array; this region is called a maximum subarray. The K-MSA has two parameters, K and w. The K-MSA detects K maximum subarrays. The weight parameter, w, is generally fixed as the average of the values in the full array, but a new approach is introduced to allow extracting smaller subsets within the large maximum subarray by changing w values (using percentiles from 50, 75, 85 and 95). This results in providing the detailed association of the specific suicide age groups and social factors. The K-MSA with lower w values (e. g., w=50 and 75 percentile) successfully identifies the general trends. From the largest maximum subarray (at k=1), a similar threshold pattern of social factors between bankruptcies and unemployment rate, and divorces and orphans and unsupported child beneficiary numbers was found respectively for females and males. This may suggest that these two similar factors may impact the suicide rate in a similar manner, but different sexes respond differently. For the age, the maximum subarray applied to all four factors, shows two female age groups; 15-54 and 55-59 years old (plus a third, with unemployment rate: 60-64 years old), and one male age group, 15-59 years old, suggesting that the suicide rate is slightly extended out for females than males with the studied social factors. Further changing the weight parameter (w=85 and 95) successfully detected detailed association of the suicide age and social factor level. Overall, very high numbers of divorces are found to be associated most with the high suicide rate among other factors. For female, the extreme divorce rate associates with the wider female age group, 1544, especially for younger females, 15-24 years old. Also, this later age group and the late 30s associates with high orphan and unsupervised beneficiary numbers, late 30s to early 40s and teenager with extremely high bankruptcies, and the early 40s and late 20s with high unemployed rate. For male, very high divorce number associates firstly with 30s and then 20s, med to high orphan number and med to very high unemployed rate with 20s to perhaps up to 34 years old, and the late 30s to early 40s, and 20s associate with extremely high and med to high bankruptcies rate, respectively. An experimental investigation using the K-MSA and a new approach, changing the weight parameter successfully provide detailed associations for the specific suicide age groups and social factor levels. Results do not identify the direct causal factors for the individual suicidal behaviour, but represent the national trends. The K-MSA method can be further evaluated with different factors as a data mining tool to help minimising the future suicide rate by setting up a specific policy for the specific age groups for different sexes, and perhaps the socioeconomic status as background information.",NA,NA,NA,ISI:000290030702137,NA,NA,NA,NA,"International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07), Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND, DEC 10-13, 2007",Lincoln Univ; HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd; Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia \& New Zealand (MSSANZ); Univ Canterbury; SGI; Lincoln Ventures Ltd; Hoare Res Software Ltd; IMACS; IEMSS; Environm Modelling \& Software; IBM,"Oxley, L and Kulasiri, D","MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY",NA,978-0-9758400-4-7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Sequence alignment analysis of the cytochrome oxidase I gene revealed that all embryos belonged to L.vulgaris. In total, 549 egg capsules were examined. Viable egg capsules (n=420) were classified into one of five maturation stages according to the primary external features. The length of the viable egg capsules varied between 40 and 170mm, and increased with embryonic development. The non-viable capsules (n=129) were categorized into four groups: I (Ginger root), non-viable II and III, and empty egg capsule (IV). The percentage of non-viable capsules (i.e. grades I, II and III) was 92.25\%. Empty capsules accounted for 7.75\% of the total non-viable egg capsules. Embryonic development was classified into a second scale of eight stages. Egg capsule stage and embryonic stage were significantly related (n=420; p<0.001), facilitating the determination of the embryo developmental phase based on the outward appearance of the egg capsules. The embryo development stage based on the external features of the egg capsules might constitute an innovative tool for in situ embryological data collection. This new method is neither time consuming nor invasive, and could be helpful in fishing cruises, for scuba diving visual census in natural habitats and for laboratory culture. Slight variability in the developmental embryonic stages within egg capsules from the same egg mass was identified. The origin of this asynchrony is discussed. Chronological appearance of organs was similar to that of the six loliginid species previously examined.

This view is based on the analysis of a simple ODE model for the interactions between cancer and normal cells. The model presents two regimes for tumor growth. In the first, cancer arises due to three reasons: a partial corruption of the functions that avoid the growth of mutated cells, an aggressive phenotype of tumor cells and exposure to external carcinogenic factors. In this case, treatments may be effective if they drive the system to the basin of attraction of the cancer cure state. In the second regime, cancer arises because the repair system is intrinsically corrupted. In this case, the complete cure is not possible since the cancer cure state is no more stable, but tumor recurrence may be delayed if treatment is prolongued. We review three indicators of the resilience of a stable equilibrium, related with size and shape of its basin of attraction: latitude, precariousness and resistance. A novel method to calculate these indicators is proposed. This method is simpler and more efficient than those currently used, and may be easily applied to other population dynamics models. We apply this method to the model and investigate how these indicators behave with parameters changes. Finally, we present some simulations to illustrate how the resilience analysis can be applied to validated models in order to obtain indicators for personalized cancer treatments.

We developed molecular markers for eDNA detection of the African jewelfish (Hemichromis letourneuxi) in and around Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, Florida. The lower limit of detection using these markers was determined as well as the effect of fish density and time on detection using controlled experiments. Specificity and sensitivity of these markers was tested in aquarium trials and also in field samples. Results showed that developed markers (probe and primers) for Taqman assays were sensitive and specific for eDNA detection via traditional and quantitative PCR methods (qPCR).

There was a positive and significant relationship between fish density and eDNA detection with detection probabilities ranging from 0.32-1.00 depending on fish density. A negative and significant relationship between average C-T values and density further corroborated our findings that target eDNA increased with increasing fish density. Developed markers detected the presence of H. letourneuxi in the canal adjacent to but not in Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge.

While it is well recognized that diplochorous dispersal systems, characterized by two successive dispersal steps performed by two different vectors (Phase I=primary seed dispersal and Phase II=secondary seed dispersal) which are common in temperate and tropical regions, little attention has been given to distinguishing the relative contribution of one-phase and two-phase dispersal to overall SDE. This conceptual gap probably results from the lack of a clear methodology to include Phase II dispersal into the calculation of SDE and to quantify its relative contribution. We propose a method to evaluate the relative contribution of one-phase and two-phase dispersal to SDE and determine whether two seed dispersers are better than one. To do so, we used the SDE landscape and an extension of the SDE landscape, the Phase II effect landscape, which measures the direction and magnitude of the Phase II dispersal effect on overall SDE. We used simulated and empirical data from a diplochorous dispersal system in the Peruvian Amazon to illustrate this new approach. Our approach provides the relative contribution of one-phase SDE (SDE1) and two-phase SDE (SDE2) to overall SDE and quantifies how much SDE changes with the addition of Phase II dispersal. Considering that the seed dispersal process is context dependent so that Phase II depends on Phase I, we predict the possible range of variation of SDE according to the variation of the probability of Phase II dispersal. In our specific study system composed of two primate species as primary dispersal vectors and different species of dung beetles as secondary dispersal vectors, the relative contribution of SDE1 and SDE2 to overall SDE varied between plant species. We discuss the context dependency of the Phase II dispersal and the potential applications of our approach. This extension to the conceptual framework of SDE enables quantitative evaluation of the effect of Phase II dispersal on plant fitness and can be easily adapted to other biotic and/or abiotic diplochorous dispersal systems.",10.1111/2041-210X.12317,2041-210X,2041-2096,ISI:000349628100007,2,NA,"Culot, Laurence/0000-0002-3353-0134 Heymann, Eckhard W./0000-0002-4259-8018","Culot, Laurence/H-9120-2012 ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, because device retrieval is typically required to access the high-resolution data they collect, their use is generally restricted to those animals that predictably return to land. Data abstraction and transmission techniques aim to address this, although currently these are limited in scope and do not incorporate, for example, acceleration measurements which can quantify animal behaviours and movement patterns over fine-scales. In this study, we present a new method for the collection, abstraction and transmission of accelerometer data from free-ranging marine predators via the Argos satellite system. We test run the technique on 20 juvenile southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina from the Kerguelen Islands during their first months at sea following weaning. Using retrieved archival data from nine individuals that returned to the colony, we compare and validate abstracted transmissions against outputs from established accelerometer processing procedures. Abstracted transmissions included estimates, across five segments of a dive profile, of time spent in prey catch attempt (PrCA) behaviours, swimming effort and pitch. These were then summarised and compared to archival outputs across three dive phases: descent, bottom and ascent. Correlations between the two datasets were variable but generally good (dependent on dive phase, marginal R-2 values of between .45 and .6 to>.9) and consistent between individuals. Transmitted estimates of PrCA behaviours and swimming effort were positively biased to those from archival processing. Data from this study represent some of the first remotely transmitted quantifications from accelerometers. The methods presented and analysed can be used to provide novel insight towards the behaviours and movements of free-ranging marine predators, such as juvenile southern elephant seals, from whom logger retrieval is challenging. Future applications could however benefit from some adaption, particularly to reduce positive bias in transmitted PrCA behaviours and swimming effort, for which this study provides useful insight.",10.1111/2041-210X.12845,2041-210X,2041-2096,ISI:000419821200008,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because we model the cannibalistic interaction as dependent on the ratio of cannibal length and victim length, a cannibal experiences a size distribution of potential victims which depends on its own body size. We show how equilibria of the resulting infinite-dimensional dynamical system can be traced with an existing method for numerical continuation for physiologically structured population models. With this approach we found that cannibalism can induce bistability associated with a fold (or, saddle-node) bifurcation. The two stable states can be qualified as `stunted' and `piscivorous', respectively. We identify a new ecological mechanism for bistability, in which the energy gain from cannibalism plays a crucial role: Whereas in the stunted population state cannibals consume their victims, on average, while they are very small and yield little energy, in the piscivorous state cannibals consume their victims not before they have become much bigger, which results in a much higher mean yield of cannibalism. We refer to this mechanism as the `Hansel and Gretel' effect. It is not related to any individual `choice' or `strategy', but depends purely on a difference in population size distribution. We argue that studying dynamics of size-structured population models with this new approach of equilibrium continuation extends the insight that can be gleaned from numerical simulations of the model dynamics.

Pablo",n,A novel statistical method for classifying habitat generalists and specialists,ECOLOGY,2011,92,1332-1343,JUN,"We develop a novel statistical approach for classifying generalists and specialists in two distinct habitats. Using a multinomial model based on estimated species relative abundance in two habitats, our method minimizes bias due to differences in sampling intensities between two habitat types as well as bias due to insufficient sampling within each habitat. The method permits a robust statistical classification of habitat specialists and generalists, without excluding rare species a priori. Based on a user-defined specialization threshold, the model classifies species into one of four groups: (1) generalist; (2) habitat A specialist; (3) habitat B specialist; and (4) too rare to classify with confidence. We illustrate our multinomial classification method using two contrasting data sets: (1) bird abundance in woodland and heath habitats in southeastern Australia and (2) tree abundance in secondgrowth (SG) and old-growth (OG) rain forests in the Caribbean lowlands of northeastern Costa Rica. We evaluate the multinomial model in detail for the tree data set. Our results for birds were highly concordant with a previous nonstatistical classification, but our method classified a higher fraction (57.7\%) of bird species with statistical confidence. Based on a conservative specialization threshold and adjustment for multiple comparisons, 64.4\% of tree species in the full sample were too rare to classify with confidence. Among the species classified, OG specialists constituted the largest class (40.6\%), followed by generalist tree species (36.7\%) and SG specialists (22.7\%). The multinomial model was more sensitive than indicator value analysis or abundance-based phi coefficient indices in detecting habitat specialists and also detects generalists statistically. Classification of specialists and generalists based on rarefied subsamples was highly consistent with classification based on the full sample, even for sampling percentages as low as 20\%. Major advantages of the new method are (1) its ability to distinguish habitat generalists (species with no significant habitat affinity) from species that are simply too rare to classify and (2) applicability to a single representative sample or a single pooled set of representative samples from each of two habitat types.

Hatchdates are determined from counting daily increments on otoliths of larvae. The hatchdate frequency distribution determined from sampling a population of larvae depends on factors influencing birth and death processes, i.e. spawning times and survival rates. Using a nonlinear and partly parametric statistical model, temperature, strong winds, and the age frequency of spawning adults were found to strongly influence hatchdates. Moreover, the interaction of both a climate regime shift and the `Exxon Valdez' oil spill in 1989 suppressed pollock larval abundance in 1989, with geometrically diminishing after-effects lasting until around 1992.

(Popul Ecol 53:351-359, 2011) presents a new method to objectively select hotspots using cumulative relative frequency distribution (CRFD) curves. This method is presented as being independent from the selection of any threshold and, therefore, less arbitrary than traditional approaches. We argue that this method, albeit mathematically sound, is based on likewise arbitrary decisions regarding threshold selection. Specifically, the use of the CRFD curve approach requires the occurrence of two criteria for the method to be applied correctly: the selection of a 45A degrees tangent to the curve, and the need to consider the highest relative value of the study parameter corresponding to a 45A degrees slope tangent to the curve. Using two case studies (dealing with species richness and abundance of a particular species), we demonstrate that these two criteria are really unrelated to the underlying causes that shape the spatial pattern of the phenomena under study, but rather related to sampling design and spatial scale; hence, one could likewise use different but valid criteria. Consequently, the CRFD curve approach is based on the selection of a pre-defined threshold that has little, if any, ecological justification, and that heavily influences the final hotspot selection. Therefore, we conclude that the CRFD curve approach itself is not necessarily better and more objective than any of the global methods typically used for hotspot identification. Indeed, mathematical and/or statistical approaches should not be viewed as a panacea to solve conservation problems, but rather used in combination with biological, practical, economic and social considerations.",10.1007/s10144-011-0272-7,1438-3896,1438-390X,ISI:000293544400008,4,NA,"Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531 Galvez-Bravo, Lucia/0000-0002-9684-9775 Cayuela, Luis/0000-0003-3562-2662","Carrascal, Luis M./B-8381-2008 Galvez-Bravo, Lucia/L-7478-2017 Cayuela, Luis/K-7255-2015",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evaluation of carrying capacity of a destination has as a purpose the measurement of the threshold over which alteration due to human activities becomes unacceptable. To evaluate the consequences of tourism activities impacts it is necessary to know the characteristics of the environment where they occur and especially its resilience, which is the measure of the disturbance that the natural environment can tolerate without altering its equilibrium state. The carrying capacity concept is linked with resilience and rises from the necessity of measure which is the maximum acceptable level of impact for the environment or for one of its components and the capability of recovery of the previous condition.

Unlike existing methods, the Quickest detection method is updated every time a data point arrives, and minimizes the time to detect an approaching threshold given the users' tolerance for false alarms. The procedure accurately detected an impending regime shift in an experimentally manipulated ecosystem. An ecosystem model was used to determine if the method can detect an approaching threshold soon enough to prevent a regime shift. When the monitored variable was directly involved in the interaction that caused the regime shift, detection was quick enough to avert collapse. When the monitored variable was only indirectly linked to the critical transition, detection came too late.

The validity of this assumption has been challenged, because there is evidence that ranges can shift rapidly and extensively. Here I test the assumption of range conservatism using simulations and empirical tests of phylogenetic signal in geographic positions of ranges within mammal orders, families, and genera. In most taxa, range positions show strong phylogenetic signal, quantified using Pagel's , Mantel tests, and a novel method to measure phylogenetic signal near the tips of a phylogeny. Taxa with highly labile range positions are exceptions to the general pattern and include very young groups such as Sciurus that may still be in the early, rapid-expansion phase of adaptive radiation. In two orders containing many species with large distributions (Artiodactyla and Carnivora), temporal patterns of range evolution are consistent with large instantaneous shifts in range position associated with allopatric speciation. In most other taxa, range evolution is better described by models that allow ranges to evolve along branches of the phylogeny. The results point to a common pattern of phylogenetically conserved ranges where the current position of species ranges reflects their position at the time of speciation, modified by gradual drift of range boundaries through time.",10.1086/679663,0003-0147,1537-5323,ISI:000349674700006,3,NA,"Cardillo, Marcel/0000-0001-9855-0817","Cardillo, Marcel/C-9396-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, metrics of resilience to environmental change are lacking. Faced with novel disturbances, forests may be able to sustain existing ecosystem services and biodiversity by exhibiting resilience, or alternatively these attributes may undergo either a linear or nonlinear decline. Here we provide a novel quantitative approach for assessing forest resilience that focuses on three components of resilience, namely resistance, recovery, and net change, using a spatially explicit model of forest dynamics. Under the pulse set scenarios, we explored the resilience of nine ecosystem services and four biodiversity measures following a one-off disturbance applied to an increasing percentage of forest area. Under the pulse+press set scenarios, the six disturbance intensities explored during the pulse set were followed by a continuous disturbance. We detected thresholds in net change under pulse+press scenarios for the majority of the ecosystem services and biodiversity measures, which started to decline sharply when disturbance affected >40\% of the landscape. Thresholds in net change were not observed under the pulse scenarios, with the exception of timber volume and ground flora species richness. Thresholds were most pronounced for aboveground biomass, timber volume with respect to the ecosystem services, and ectomycorrhizal fungi and ground flora species richness with respect to the biodiversity measures. Synthesis and applications. The approach presented here illustrates how the multidimensionality of stability research in ecology can be addressed and how forest resilience can be estimated in practice. Managers should adopt specific management actions to support each of the three components of resilience separately, as these may respond differently to disturbance. In addition, management interventions aiming to deliver resilience should incorporate an assessment of both pulse and press disturbances to ensure detection of threshold responses to disturbance, so that appropriate management interventions can be identified.",10.1002/ece3.3491,2045-7758,NA,ISI:000415900800038,22,NA,"Cantarello, Elena/0000-0001-7529-2018 Gosal, Arjan/0000-0001-6782-0706",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The capacity of vegetation to use soil water depends on its root distribution (RD). However, RD is extremely variable in space and difficult to measure in the field, which hinders accurate predictions of water fluxes and vegetation dynamics. We propose a new method to estimate RD within water balance models, assuming that vegetation is at eco-hydrological equilibrium (EHE). EHE conditions imply that vegetation optimizes RD such that transpiration is maximized within the limits of bearable drought stress, characterized here by species-specific hydraulic thresholds. Optimized RD estimates were validated against RD estimates obtained by model calibration from sap flow or soil moisture from 38 forest plots in Catalonia (NE Spain). In water-limited plots, optimized RD was similar to calibrated RD, but estimates diverged with higher water availability, suggesting that the EHE may not be assumed when water is not limiting. Thereafter, we applied the optimization procedure at the regional scale, to estimate RD for the water-limited forests of Catalonia. Regional variations of optimum RD reproduced many expected patterns in response to climate, soil physical properties, forest structure, and species hydraulic traits. We conclude that RD optimization, based on the EHE hypothesis and a simple description of plant hydraulics, produces realistic estimates of RD that can be used for model parameterization and shows promise to improve our ability to forecast vegetation dynamics under increased drought.",10.1002/eco.2015,1936-0584,1936-0592,ISI:000446431200030,7,UNSP e2015,"Poyatos, Rafael/0000-0003-0521-2523 De Caceres, Miquel/0000-0001-7132-2080","Poyatos, Rafael/F-8305-2010 De Caceres, Miquel/I-1279-2016",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet the range of coral responses to sediments both within and amongst species has limited our ability to determine representative threshold values. This study reviews information available on coral physiological responses to a range of sediment loads at varying time frames and provides a novel approach to assess coral thresholds to suspended and deposited sediments. The new approach replicates natural turbidity regimes by creating pulsed turbidity events at two environmentally realistic levels (moderate = similar to 50 mg l(-1), peaks at 100 mg l(-1); severe = similar to 100 mg l(-1), peaks at 250 mg l(-1)). Corals (Merulina ampliata, Pachyseris speciosa, Platygyra sinensis) were subjected to two exposure regimes: pulsed turbidity events for four weeks followed by two months of recovery (constant regime) or pulsed turbidity events every other week followed by one month of recovery (periodic regime). Coral thresholds were greater than commonly used estimates with little to no effect on corals at moderate sediment levels. At extreme sediment levels, species morphological differences were potentially key determinants of coral survival. The periodic exposure regime was less detrimental to all coral species than the constant exposure regime as demonstrated by elevated yields and lower tissue morality rates. To improve knowledge on coral-sediment threshold values, research needs to expand to incorporate a broader range of species and exposure regimes. Realistic threshold values combined with modelling efforts would improve prediction of reef health and enable managers to react to declines in health before coral mortality occurs.

(1993). The ice masses of Svalbard cover an area of ca 36 600 km(2) and more than 60\% of the glaciated areas are glaciers which terminate in the sea at calving ice-cliffs. Recent data on the geometry of glacier tongues, their flow velocities and front position changes have been extracted from ASTER images acquired from 2000-2006 using automated methods of satellite image analysis. Analyses have shown that 163 Svalbard glaciers are of tidewater type (having contact with the ocean) and the total length of their calving ice-cliffs is 860 km. When compared with the previous inventory, 14 glaciers retreated from the ocean to the land over a 30-40 year period. Eleven formerly land-based glaciers now terminate in the sea. A new method of assessing the dynamic state of glaciers, based on patterns of frontal crevassing, has been developed. Tidewater glacier termini are divided into four groups on the basis of differences in crevasse patterns and flow velocity: (1) very slow or stagnant glaciers, (2) slow-flowing glaciers, (3) fast-flowing glaciers, (4) surging glaciers (in the active phase) and fast ice streams. This classification has enabled us to estimate total calving flux from Svalbard glaciers with an accuracy appreciably higher than that of previous attempts. Mass loss due to calving from the whole archipelago (excluding Kvitoya) is estimated to be 5.0-8.4 km(3) yr(-1) (water equivalent - w.e.), with a mean value 6.75 1.7 km3 yr(-1) (w.e.). Thus, ablation due to calving contributes as much as 17-25\% (with a mean value 21\%) to the overall mass loss from Svalbard glaciers. By implication, the contribution of Svalbard iceberg flux to sea-level rise amounts to ca 0.02 mm yr(-1). Also calving flux in the Arctic has been considered and the highest annual specific mass balance attributable to iceberg calving has been found for Svalbard.",NA,0138-0338,2081-8262,ISI:000267411500001,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A new approach for rivers, known as the Dundee Hydrological Regime Assessment Method (DHRAM) has been developed. The underlying rationale is to assess the risk of significant impact on biota arising from changes in hydrological regime, as distinct from chemical or hydromorphological influences. This approach is based on the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) methodology of Richter et al. (1996), in which the degree of alteration of a range of hydrological variables that are significant to biota are estimated. The DHRAM method classifies the degree of alteration to hydrological regime using a five-point scale, which correlates with the risk of ecological damage. These categories are compatible with those of the WFD. The acquisition of appropriate biological data for calibration and validation of DHRAM has, however, proved problematic. This paper proposes the future development of a calibration scheme which compares the biota of neighbouring water bodies (pairs whose physical attributes are as similar as possible in all relevant respects, except in the degree of disturbance to their hydrological regimes).",NA,0144-7815,NA,ISI:000185215200006,276,NA,"Duck, Robert/0000-0002-8096-4699 Rowan, John/0000-0001-5693-9306 Black, Andrew/0000-0001-9292-1146","Duck, Robert/E-5801-2012 Rowan, John/F-6539-2011 ","Symposium on the Structure, Function and Management Implications of Fluvial Sedimentary Systems, ALICE SPRINGS, AUSTRALIA, SEP 02-06, 2002","IAHS, Int Commiss Continental Eros; UNESCO, Int Hydrol Programme","Dyer, FJ and Thoms, MC and Olley, JM","STRUCTURE, FUNCTION AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS OF FLUVIAL SEDIMENTARY SYSTEMS",IAHS PUBLICATION,1-901502-96-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The method also makes it possible to examine the different uses of chromatic signals (e.g. the generation of perceived colour, or the construction and representation of object structure and form). By using this technique, we studied the threshold detection of chromatic signals in normal trichromats. The results show that chromatic signals are virtually unaffected by ongoing, randomly varying, luminance contrast changes. These findings suggest that chromatic signals are either processed independently or can be separated completely from any confounding luminance contrast components in the stimulus. Thresholds for detection of colour changes only, and for extraction of stimulus structure from chromatic signals in normal trichromats, in subjects with single cone receptor deficiency (i.e. dichromats) and in three subjects with abnormal colour vision caused by bilateral damage to ventromedial, extra-striate visual cortex (i.e. subjects with cerebral achromatopsia) have also been measured. No significant difference in thresholds for the two conditions was observed either in normal trichromats or in dichromats. Subjects with cerebral achromatopsia, however, reveal markedly different thresholds. The results suggest that chromatic signals are processed independently to generate perceived object colour or to construct spatially structured objects, and that these functions involve different neural substrates. The results help to explain, at least in part, why cerebral achromatopsia is a het and why there can be significant differences in the effective use of chromatic signals in subjects described as cerebral achromatopsics.",10.1098/rspb.1994.0181,0962-8452,NA,ISI:A1994QB14000018,1353,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The RfD for a chemical is typically reported as a single number, even though it is widely acknowledged that there are significant uncertainties inherent in the derivation of this number. In this article, the authors propose a probabilistic alternative to the EPA's method that expresses the human population threshold as a probability distribution of values (rather than a single RfD value), taking into account the major sources of scientific uncertainty in such estimates. The approach is illustrated using much of the same data that USEPA uses to justify their current RfD procedure. Like the EPA's approach, our approach recognizes the four key extrapolations that are necessary to define the human population threshold based on animal data: animal to human, human heterogeneity, LOAEL to NOAEL, and subchronic to chronic. Rather than using available data to define point estimates of `'uncertainty factors'' for these extrapolations, the proposed approach uses available data to define a probability distribution of adjustment factors. These initial characterizations of uncertainty can then be refined when more robust or specific data become available for a particular chemical or class of chemicals. Quantitative characterization of uncertainty in noncancer risk assessment will be useful to risk managers who face complex trade-offs between control costs and protection of public health. The new approach can help decision-makers understand how much extra control cost must be expended to achieve a specified increase in confidence that the human population threshold is not being exceeded.",10.1080/10807039.1996.10387463,1080-7039,1549-7860,ISI:A1996UR81500013,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For this purpose we developed a new approach that allowed us to quantify the performance of defoliated plants relative not only to the performance of undamaged plants, but also relative to the estimated performance of hypothetical defoliated plants that do not exhibit any. mechanisms of compensatory growth. The latter provides a way to quantify the adaptive value of compensation with reference to a hypothetical noncompensating alternative state. C. elegans plants were grown in a greenhouse at two light levels (5\% and 16\% of natural daylight) and subjected to five defoliation treatments (a control and four levels of defoliation). Defoliation was repeated every three months. Growth analysis revealed that defoliated plants allocated considerably more mass to the production of leaf laminas (f(lam)) than control plants, at the expense of allocation to other organs, particularly reproductive structures. Average growth rates per unit leaf area (NAR) and per unit plant mass (RGR), both measured on the basis of above-ground mass, increased with the level of defoliation at high light but not at low light. We estimated that the increases in f(lam) and NAR enabled C. elegans to compensate for part of the potential loss in performance caused by defoliation, even in cases where their RGR values were lower than those of control plants. Sensitivity analysis indicated that changes in NAR contributed more to this compensation than f(lam), but the importance of f(lam) increased with defoliation level and with decreasing light availability. The degree of compensation was higher in the high- than in the low-light treatment, suggesting that the possession of traits associated with compensatory growth. may be more important in sunny than in shaded environments. The degree of compensation differed depending on the measure of performance. Defoliated plants fully compensated for the potential reduction in lamina growth but compensated for <20\% of estimated loss in reproductive output. Since survival of C. elegans plants appears to be. strongly associated with their total leaf area, the greater compensation for lamina growth is important in relation to population dynamics.",10.1890/02-0454,0012-9658,NA,ISI:000187363200010,11,NA,"Ackerly, David/0000-0002-1847-7398","Ackerly, David/A-1247-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
