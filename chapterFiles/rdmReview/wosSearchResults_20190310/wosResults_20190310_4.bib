Abstract = {{In semi-arid cities, urban trees are often irrigated, but may also
   utilize natural water sources such as groundwater. Consequently, the
   sources of water for urban tree transpiration may be uncertain,
   complicating efforts to efficiently manage water resources. We used a
   novel approach based on stable isotopes to determine tree water sources
   in the Los Angeles basin, where we hypothesized that trees would rely on
   irrigation water in the soil rather than develop deep roots to tap into
   groundwater. We evaluated the oxygen (delta O-18) and hydrogen (delta D)
   isotope ratios of xylem water, irrigation water, soil water, and
   groundwater in a study of temporal patterns in water sources at two
   urban sites, and a study of spatial patterns at nine urban sites and one
   ``natural{''} riparian forest. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that
   despite frequent irrigation, some trees tap into groundwater, although
   in most species this was a small water source. Some trees appeared to be
   using very shallow soil water at < 30 cm depth, suggesting that these
   mature urban trees were quite shallowly rooted. In the natural site,
   trees appeared to be using urban runoff in addition to shallow soil
   water. We were able to identify tree uptake of precipitation at only 3
   sites. The results show that some irrigated trees utilize groundwater
   and do not rely solely on irrigation water, which may make them able to
   withstand drought and/or water conservation measures. However, some
   irrigated trees may develop very shallow root systems, which may make
   them more susceptible.}},

Abstract = {{For studies investigating trait evolution, there are at least two

   also integrate data from fossil taxa into phylogenetic estimation of

   These analyses suggest that ecological conditions in temperate regions

Title = {{Combining farmers' decision rules and landscape stochastic regularities

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{433-446}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Landscape spatial organization (LSO) strongly impacts many environmental
   issues. Modelling agricultural landscapes and describing meaningful
   landscape patterns are thus regarded as key-issues for designing
   sustainable landscapes. Agricultural landscapes are mostly designed by
   farmers. Their decisions dealing with crop choices and crop allocation
   to land can be generic and result in landscape regularities, which
   determine LSO. This paper comes within the emerging discipline called
   ``landscape agronomy{''}, aiming at studying the organization of farming
   practices at the landscape scale. We here aim at articulating the farm
   and the landscape scales for landscape modelling. To do so, we develop
   an original approach consisting in the combination of two methods used
   separately so far: the identification of explicit farmer decision rules
   through on-farm surveys methods and the identification of landscape
   stochastic regularities through data-mining. We applied this approach to
   the Niort plain landscape in France. Results show that generic farmer
   decision rules dealing with sunflower or maize area and location within
   landscapes are consistent with spatiotemporal regularities identified at
   the landscape scale. It results in a segmentation of the landscape,
   based on both its spatial and temporal organization and partly explained
   by generic farmer decision rules. This consistency between results
   points out that the two modelling methods aid one another for land-use
   modelling at landscape scale and for understanding the driving forces of
   its spatial organization. Despite some remaining challenges, our study
   in landscape agronomy accounts for both spatial and temporal dimensions
   of crop allocation: it allows the drawing of new spatial patterns
   coherent with land-use dynamics at the landscape scale, which improves
   the links to the scale of ecological processes and therefore contributes
   to landscape ecology.}},

Title = {{Implications of spatially extensive historical data from surveys for
   restoring dry forests of Oregon's eastern Cascades}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Dry western forests (e.g., ponderosa pine and mixed conifer) were
   thought to have been historically old and park-like, maintained by
   low-severity fires, and to have become denser and more prone to
   high-severity fire. In the Pacific Northwest, early aerial photos
   (primarily in Washington), showed that dry forests instead had
   variable-severity fires and forest structure, but more detail is needed.
   Here I used pre-1900 General Land Office Surveys, with new methods that
   allow accurate reconstruction of detailed forest structure, to test
   eight hypotheses about historical structure and fire across about
   400,000 ha of dry forests in Oregon's eastern Cascades. The
   reconstructions show that only about 13.5\% of these forests had low
   tree density. Forests instead were generally dense (mean = 249
   trees/ha), but density varied by a factor of 2-4 across about 25,000-ha
   areas. Shade-tolerant firs historically were 17\% of trees, dominated
   about 12\% of forest area, and were common in forest understories.
   Understory trees and shrubs dominated on 83.5\%, and were dense across
   44.8\% of forest area. Small trees (10-40 cm dbh) were >50\% of trees
   across 72.3\% of forest area. Low-severity fire dominated on only
   23.5\%, mixed-severity fire on 50.2\%, and high-severity fire on 26.2\%
   of forest area. Historical fire included modest-rotation (29-78 years)
   low-severity and long-rotation (435 years) high-severity fire. Given
   historical variability in fire and forest structure, an ecological
   approach to restoration would restore fuels and manage for
   variable-severity fires, rather than reduce fuels to lower fire risk.
   Modest reduction in white fir/grand fir and an increase in large snags,
   down wood, and large trees would enhance recovery from past extensive
   logging and increase resiliency to future global change. These forests
   can be maintained by wildland fire use, coupled, near infrastructure,
   with prescribed fires that mimic historical low-severity fires.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of systematic high-resolution satellite photography,
   striking geometric shapes of banded vegetation several km(2) in size,
   but not apparent from the ground, have been documented for many areas of
   the arid and semiarid world. Banded vegetation, in which dense perennial
   vegetation alternates with bands of bare soil may originate from
   geomorphic processes, ecological self-organization, or human land use.
   In the Chihuahuan Desert of New Mexico prominent arc-shaped bands of
   vegetation and dunes occur along the contact of a piedmont slope
   (bajada) and basin floor. The origin and chronology of this banded
   vegetation-dune complex was investigated using early aerial photography
   (1936-1942), landscape photography (1918), vegetation and soil surveys
   (1858, 1918), soil stratigraphy, C-13/C-12 ratios, and C-14 dating.
   These methods reveal two periods of eolian deposition. The first began
   in the Medieval Warm Period (ca. AD 900-1300) and was followed by a
   period of landscape stability during the Little Ice Age (ca. AD 1500 to
   1850). The second began in the late-1800s when widespread
   desertification occurred throughout the American Southwest. Banded
   vegetation was initiated after formation of erosional scarplets that
   functioned as obstacles upon which eolian sand accumulated, thus
   becoming a dam to overland flow and causing strips of vegetation to
   form. Banded vegetation in this study is an emergent pattern produced by
   a coupled ecologic-geomorphic-climatic system. The stratigraphic record
   produced by this system enables us to compare current ecological
   responses to climate change with baseline prehistorical responses to
   climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Estimate the richness of a community with accuracy despite differences
   in sampling effort is a key aspect to monitoring high diverse
   ecosystems. We compiled a worldwide multitaxa database, comprising 185
   communities, in order to study the relationship between the percentage
   of species represented by one individual (singletons) and the intensity
   of sampling (number of individuals divided by the number of species
   sampled). The database was used to empirically adjust a correction
   factor to improve the performance of non-parametrical estimators under
   conditions of low sampling effort. The correction factor was tested on
   seven estimators (Chao1, Chao2, Jack1, Jack2, ACE, ICE and Bootstrap).
   The correction factor was able to reduce the bias of all estimators
   tested under conditions of undersampling, while converging to the
   original uncorrected values at higher intensities. Our findings led us
   to recommend the threshold of 20 individuals/species, or less than 21\%
   of singletons, as a minimum sampling effort to produce reliable richness
   estimates of high diverse ecosystems using corrected non-parametric
   estimators. This threshold rise for 50 individuals/species if
   non-corrected estimators are used which implies in an economy of 60\% of
   sampling effort if the correction factor is used. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Question: Can increased host resistance drive a pathogen to extinction?
   Do more complex ecosystems lead to significantly different evolutionary
   behaviour and new potential extinctions?
   Mathematical method: Merging host-parasite models with predator-prey
   models. Analytically studying evolution using adaptive dynamics and
   trade-off and invasion plots, and carrying out numerical simulations.
   Key assumptions: Mass action (general mixing). All individuals of a
   given phenotype are identical. Only prey vulnerable to infection.
   Mutations are small and rare (however, the assumption on the size of
   mutation is relaxed later). In simulations, very small (negligible)
   populations are at risk of extinction.
   Conclusions: The presence of the predator can significantly change
   evolutionary outcomes for host resistance to a pathogen and can create
   branching points where none occurred previously. The pathogen (and
   sometimes the predator) is protected from exclusion if we take mutations
   to be arbitrarily small; however, relaxing the assumption on mutation
   size can lead to its exclusion. Increased resistance can drive the
   predator and/or pathogen to extinction depending on inter-species
   dynamics, such as the predator's preference for infected prey. Predator
   co-evolution can move exclusion boundaries and prevent the predator's
   own extinction if its rate of mutation is high enough (with respect to

Title = {{A predation risk-and-avoidance model of nestling responses to parental
   vocalizations}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{235-245}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Question: How does the nest type of a bird species-cup versus
   cavity-affect the evolution of its nestlings' responses to parental
   vocalizations?
   Background: Nestling birds show distinct behavioural responses either to
   parental begging-solicitation calls (switch-on begging, lower-frequency
   sounds) or to parental alarm calls (switch-off begging, high-frequency
   sounds), but rarely to both. Previous theory suggested that differences
   in the vibrational conductance of cup versus cavity nests drive the
   evolution of divergent nestling responses to the different types of
   parental vocalizations. Many predators eavesdrop on begging displays of
   nestling birds, then locate the nest and prey on the brood. The risk of
   predation on broods in cup nests is consistently greater than on broods
   in cavity nests.
   New theory: Whether nestlings respond to parental begging-solicitation
   calls (switch-on) or to parental alarm calls (switch-off) is dependent
   on a trade-off influenced by predation risks. Although switch-on calls
   are more efficient at protecting the nestlings that perceive them, they
   are less efficient at delivering their signal to younger nestlings with
   poorer sensory and discriminatory abilities (compared with switch-off
   calls). Thus, where predation risk is high, `off' calls are favoured;
   where predation risk is lower, `on' calls are favoured.
   Hypotheses: Cup-nesting species, which have higher rates of predation,
   use `off' signals, which their young are able to sense early in life
   before they can sense `on' signals. Cavity-nesting species are the
   opposite in all particulars. In addition, cavity nestlings develop the
   ability to sense low-frequency `on' sounds later than cup nestlings
   develop the ability to sense high-frequency `off' signals.
   Method: We examined existing comparative data on predation rates at
   different nesting locations. Using auditory brainstem response studies,
   we also examined data on the development (ontogeny) of acoustic
   sensitivity in altricial avian species.
   Results: Nestlings of cup-nesting species suffer relatively higher
   predation rates than nestlings of cavity-nesting species. At first,
   nestlings can hear only a narrow range of sound frequencies. Nestlings
   gradually develop sensitivity to the full spectrum of vocalizations only
   after several weeks. The sparse data available on avian auditory
   ontogeny indicate that cup-nesting species develop early sensitivity to
   high-frequency sounds, and cavity nesters do so to lower-frequency
   sounds.
   Conclusion: The higher predation rates of cup nesters compared with
   cavity nesters, coupled with the post-hatching delay of all nestlings in
   achieving full sensitivity to the different types and frequency ranges
   of parental calls, provide a reasonable explanation for the evolutionary
   advantage of alarm calls to cup nesters and begging-solicitation calls
   to cavity nesters.}},

   Responses to Anthropogenic Sounds}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{21-28}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Acute effects of anthropogenic sounds on marine mammals, such as from
   military sonars, energy development, and offshore construction, have
   received considerable international attention from scientists,
   regulators, and industry. Moreover, there has been increasing
   recognition and concern about the potential chronic effects of human
   activities (e.g., shipping). It has been demonstrated that increases in
   human activity and background noise can alter habitats of marine animals
   and potentially mask communications for species that rely on sound to
   mate, feed, avoid predators, and navigate. Without exception, regulatory
   agencies required to assess and manage the effects of noise on marine
   mammals have addressed only the acute effects of noise on hearing and
   behavior. Furthermore, they have relied on a single exposure metric to
   assess acute effects: the absolute sound level received by the animal.
   There is compelling evidence that factors other than received sound
   level, including the activity state of animals exposed to different
   sounds, the nature and novelty of a sound, and spatial relations between
   sound source and receiving animals (i.e., the exposure context) strongly
   affect the probability of a behavioral response. A more comprehensive
   assessment method is needed that accounts for the fact that multiple
   contextual factors can affect how animals respond to both acute and
   chronic noise. We propose a three-part approach. The first includes
   measurement and evaluation of context-based behavioral responses of
   marine mammals exposed to various sounds. The second includes new
   assessment metrics that emphasize relative sound levels (i.e., ratio of
   signal to background noise and level above hearing threshold). The third
   considers the effects of chronic and acute noise exposure. All three
   aspects of sound exposure (context, relative sound level, and chronic
   noise) mediate behavioral response, and we suggest they be integrated
   into ecosystem-level management and the spatial planning of human
   offshore activities.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying rates of morphological evolution is important in many
   macroevolutionary studies, and critical when assessing possible adaptive
   radiations and episodes of punctuated equilibrium in the fossil record.
   However, studies of morphological rates of change have lagged behind
   those on taxonomic diversification, and most authors have focused on
   continuous characters and quantifying patterns of morphological rates
   over time. Here, we provide a phylogenetic approach, using discrete
   characters and three statistical tests to determine points on a
   cladogram (branches or entire clades) that are characterized by
   significantly high or low rates of change. These methods include a
   randomization approach that identifies branches with significantly high
   rates and likelihood ratio tests that pinpoint either branches or clades
   that have significantly higher or lower rates than the pooled rate of
   the remainder of the tree. As a test case for these methods, we analyze
   a discrete character dataset of lungfish, which have long been regarded
   as living fossils due to an apparent slowdown in rates since the
   Devonian. We find that morphological rates are highly heterogeneous
   across the phylogeny and recover a general pattern of decreasing rates
   along the phylogenetic backbone toward living taxa, from the Devonian
   until the present. Compared with previous work, we are able to report a
   more nuanced picture of lungfish evolution using these new methods.}},

Abstract = {{1. Many alien weeds pose significant environmental and/or economic
   threats across the globe, and methods to assess the potential risk of
   species introductions are key components in the management of plant
   invasions. Three broad approaches have been adopted in weed risk
   assessment: quantitative statistical models, semi-quantitative scoring
   and qualitative expert assessment. Yet, the effectiveness of these
   different approaches is rarely evaluated. By bringing together
   perspectives drawn from statistics, complexity theory, bioeconomics and
   cognitive psychology, this review presents the first interdisciplinary
   appraisal of whether weed risk assessment is a valuable tool in the
   management of plant invasions.
   2. Problems in obtaining an objective measure of the hazards posed by
   weeds, challenges of predicting complex hierarchical and nonlinear
   systems, difficulties in quantifying uncertainty and variability, as
   well as cognitive biases in expert judgement, all limit the utility of
   current risk assessment approaches. The accuracy of weed risk assessment
   protocols is usually insufficient, given inherent low base-rates even
   when the costs and benefits of decisions are taken into account, and
   implies that the predictive value of weed risk assessment is
   questionable.
   3. Current practices could be improved to address consistent hazard
   identification, encompass a hierarchy of spatio-temporal scales,
   incorporate uncertainty, generate realistic base-rates, and train risk
   assessors to limit cognitive biases. However, such refinements may still
   fail to predict weed risks any better than a knowledge of prior invasion
   history and quality of climate match.
   4. Alternative approaches include scenario planning that seeks
   qualitative inputs regarding hypothetical events to facilitate
   long-range planning using multiple alternatives each explicit in their
   treatment of uncertainty. This represents a change from prevention
   towards adaptive management where the difficulty in prediction is
   acknowledged and investment targets early detection, mitigation and
   management.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Scenario planning may be particularly
   suitable for weeds as they can be rapidly surveyed and have sufficiently
   long lag phases between naturalisation and invasion that early detection
   is often feasible. If integrated with assessments of ecosystem
   vulnerability to invasion and interventions to improve ecosystem
   resilience, it would deliver a robust post-border approach to invasive
   plant management. This approach would address threats from new
   introductions as well as `sleeper weeds' already present in a region.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian forests of the American Southwest are especially prone to
   changes in composition and structure due to natural and anthropogenic
   factors. To determine how breeding mourning doves (Zenaida macroura)
   respond to these changes, we examined nest site use and nest survival in
   control plots, fuel reduction plots before and after mechanical
   thinning, and post-wildfire sites. The greatest number of nests (50\%)
   were located in post-wildfire sites where resprouted vegetation and
   woody debris provided numerous nest sites in the understory. We found
   fewer nests in post-treatment fuel reduction plots (17\%), where most
   were constructed in cottonwoods, and an intermediate number of nests in
   control and pre-treatment plots (33\%), where most were constructed in
   exotic plants. The best-supported logistic-exposure nest survival model
   indicated that survival varied among years and with date. Models
   containing effects of forest type, study block, and nest site selection
   received little support, suggesting that survival was constant among
   plot locations, disturbance types, and nest sites. Our nest survival
   estimates were low relative to those from other studies, but
   productivity could offset mortality if adults make numerous nest
   attempts each year. Our results highlight the utility of woody
   vegetation and debris as understory nest sites for mourning doves and
   other riparian birds. Managers should devise methods to preserve or
   reestablish these nest sites when conducting fuel reduction, exotic
   vegetation removal, or post-fire restoration activities. (C) 2011 The

   (Vombatus ursinus) activity in a riparian forest}},
Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{62-70}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Question: Is the composition of groundstorey vegetation influenced by
   wombat burrowing and mound construction as well as streambank tracks by
   domestic cattle at high and low levels of usage?
   Location: Sixteen streambank study sites in an agricultural area in
   Kangaroo Valley, southeastern New South Wales, Australia.
   Methods: We examined the effects of cattle and wombats on vegetation by
   measuring plant and litter cover on three markedly different microsites;
   wombat mounds, the network of tracks used by both cattle and wombats to
   access pastures away from the riparian area, and control sites that were
   neither tracks nor mounds, and which were located 1-2 m away from mounds
   or tracks.
   Results: We recorded significantly fewer vascular plant species on the
   mounds and tracks than on the control microsites, but there were
   significantly more species at sites of high cattle usage than low cattle
   usage. Plant cover on the control microsites was more than twice that on
   the mounds and tracks. The exotic plants, panic veldt grass (Ehrharta
   erecta) and kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) were typical indicators of
   high cattle use sites, while wandering jew (Tradescantia fluminensis)
   and to a lesser extent the unpalatable, low-sprawling shrub mist-flower
   (Ageratina riparia) were indicators of low cattle use sites.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that there are few differences in
   plant community composition between microsites constructed by cattle and
   those of wombats. Both microsites supported a community that was a
   subset of the species pool in the surrounding vegetation. Cattle grazing
   since 1851 in Kangaroo Valley has probably reduced disturbance-sensitive
   plant species, resulting in an effect that is more apparent at the
   landscape scale. Further study should focus on the landscape-scale
   effects of cattle grazing to determine whether cattle or wombats are the
   major causes of ecosystem degradation in Australian riparian
   environments.}},

Pages = {{121-133}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aim We assess the realism of bioclimate envelope model projections for
   anticipated future climates by validating ecosystem reconstructions for
   the late Quaternary with fossil and pollen data. Specifically, we ask:
   (1) do climate conditions with no modern analogue negatively affect the
   accuracy of ecosystem reconstructions? (2) are bioclimate envelope model
   projections biased towards under-predicting forested ecosystems? (3)
   given a palaeoecological perspective, are potential habitat projections
   for the 21st century within model capabilities?
   Location Western North America.
   Methods We used an ensemble classifier modelling approach (RandomForest)
   to spatially project the climate space of modern ecosystem classes
   throughout the Holocene (at 6000, 9000, 11,000, 14,000, 16,000, and
   21,000 YBP) using palaeoclimate surfaces generated by two general
   circulationmodels (GFDL and CCM1). The degree of novel arrangement of
   climate variables was quantified with the multivariate Mahalanobis
   distance to the nearest modern climatic equivalent. Model projections
   were validated against biome classifications inferred from 1460
   palaeoecological records.
   Results Model accuracy assessed against independent palaeoecology data
   is generally low for the present day, increases for 6000 YBP, and then
   rapidly declines towards the last glacial maximum, primarily due to the
   under-prediction of forested biomes. Misclassifications were closely
   correlated with the degree of climate dissimilarity from the present
   day. For future projections, no-analogue climates unexpectedly emerged
   in the coastal Pacific Northwest but were absent throughout the rest of
   the study area.
   Main conclusions Bioclimate envelope models could approximately
   reconstruct ecosystem distributions for the mid-to late-Holocene but
   proved unreliable in the Late Pleistocene. We attribute this failure to
   a combination of no-analogue climates and a potential lack of niche
   conservatism in tree species. However, climate dissimilarities in future
   projections are comparatively minor (similar to those of the
   mid-Holocene), and we conclude that no-analogue climates should not
   compromise the accuracy of model predictions for the next century.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{282-292}},

Abstract = {{Aim A great deal of information on distribution and diversity can be
   extracted from presenceabsence matrices (PAMs), the basic analytical
   tool of many biogeographic studies. This paper presents numerical
   procedures that allow the analysis of such information by taking
   advantage of mathematical relationships within PAMs. In particular, we
   show how rangediversity (RD) plots summarize much of the information
   contained in the matrices by the simultaneous depiction of data on
   distribution and diversity.
   Innovation We use matrix algebra to extract and process data from PAMs.
   Information on the distribution of species and on species richness of
   sites is computed using the traditional R (by rows) and Q (by columns)
   procedures, as well as the new Rq (by rows, considering the structure of
   columns) and Qr (by columns, considering the structure by rows) methods.
   Matrix notation is particularly suitable for summarizing complex
   calculations using PAMs, and the associated algebra allows the
   implementation of efficient computational programs. We show how
   information on distribution and species richness can be depicted
   simultaneously in RD plots, allowing a direct examination of the
   relationship between those two aspects of diversity. We explore the
   properties of RD plots with a simple example, and use null models to
   show that while parameters of central tendency are not affected by
   randomization, the dispersion of points in RD plots does change, showing
   the significance of patterns of co-occurrence of species and of
   similarity among sites.
   Main conclusion Species richness and range size are both valid measures
   of diversity that can be analysed simultaneously with RD plots. A full
   analysis of a system requires measures of central tendency and
   dispersion for both distribution and species richness.}},

Abstract = {{Cootes Paradise Marsh is a large urban wetland of western Lake Ontario
   that has undergone major restoration as part of the Hamilton Harbour
   Remedial Action Plan. A key component of the restoration plan is
   exclusion of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) via construction of the
   Cootes Paradise Fishway that became operational in 1997. Here, we
   evaluate the response of the marsh community to carp exclusion using
   three approaches. First of all we analyze changes in water quality
   parameters and the community composition of zooplankton, macrophytes and
   fish. Secondly, we use ecological indices based on water quality,
   zooplankton, macrophytes and fish communities to track changes in
   quality. Lastly, we evaluate changes in the wetland quality of Cootes
   Paradise over the past decade in comparison with two other coastal
   wetlands of the Laurentian Great Lakes for which long-term data exist
   (Matchedash Bay of Lake Huron and Long Point Marsh of Lake Erie). Our
   results show that there has been variable improvement in wetland quality
   at Cootes Paradise, but compared to the two other wetlands, it is still
   the most degraded in all aspects studied. The overall trend towards
   moderately better water quality conditions in Cootes Paradise over the
   past decade is not directly reflected in the zooplankton, macrophyte and
   fish communities. We believe that high nutrient levels and high
   turbidity are preventing the progression to a clear-water macrophyte
   dominated system. This is one of few long-term studies that tracks the
   progress of restoration in a degraded marsh. It underscores the
   difficulty in trying to restore a `novel ecosystem' to its original
   biotic and abiotic characteristics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Studying changes to the shape, size, and arrangement of patches of
   forest habitat remains a challenge in the field of landscape ecology. A
   major issue is that most landscape pattern metrics measure both the
   amount of habitat as well as habitat configuration. To obtain
   independent measures of habitat configuration, the established approach
   is a detrending analysis using regression residuals between
   configuration metrics and habitat abundance. We compared this detrending
   approach with a new set of three normalized configuration metrics and
   evaluated their suitability to detect changes to forest fragmentation in
   the Canadian boreal forest as a result of fire disturbance. We found
   that the combination of two of the three normalized configuration
   metrics responds well to habitat configuration dynamics after fire,
   whereas the classical approach provides an inferior measure of changes
   to habitat configuration. Our second objective was to examine whether
   spatial configuration metrics can be directly predicted from non-spatial
   surrogates that describe the initial habitat structure and the
   disturbance regime. This has practical value, because many models that
   guide forest management and conservation are non-spatial. We found that
   normalized configuration metrics were predicted with moderate accuracy
   (average adjusted r(2) = 0.53), while detrended metrics could not be
   predicted (r(2) = 0.16). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ultimately, the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems is
   defined by the transfer of autotrophic production to higher trophic
   levels and selective consumption of these autotrophs by predators.
   Hence, feeding regulation via modification of grazing and food
   incorporation by predators is critical for understanding and predicting
   the dynamics of ecosystems. In marine ecosystem and biogeochemical
   models, feeding regulation by consumers is assumed to be mainly dictated
   by food quality (Q), which is determined using food quality modules
   (FQMs) that mimic a consumers' ability to anticipate fitness
   consequences for feeding on specific prey items. Current FQMs are based
   on frameworks that a priori identify specific food components, usually
   nitrogen (N), and/or phosphorus, as limiting. This negates the
   importance of consumer physiology, and ignores biochemical constrains on
   the limiting role of chemical elements in animal production. To help
   address these problems, we propose a new adaptive approach that bases Q
   on consumers' capacity for food uptake and metabolic physiology.
   Uniquely, it (i) has separate pathways for the utilisation of carbon (C)
   associated with proteins, lipids and carbohydrates, (ii) considers
   stage-specific structural biochemical requirement of animals, and (iii)
   does not treat consumers' structural demand for carbon as a ``unitary
   requirement{''} but discriminates among the required biochemical forms
   of carbon. The approach is applicable to all heterotrophs. In the
   example given here the model has been configured to represent the
   calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa. Consistent with experimental
   observation, but unlike previous models, our model predicts the
   relationship between Q and food C:N to be unimodal with a maximum Q only
   at the threshold C:N for biomass production. Results suggest that prey
   C:N ratios may be irrelevant for food quality due to macromolecular
   biochemical constrains on the utilisation of chemical elements. This
   result emphasizes the importance of biochemical substances in animal
   nutrition and production as well as the necessity of developing food
   quality models able to adapt to the biochemical needs of the consumer.

Abstract = {{Biological processes and physical oceanography are often integrated in
   numerical modelling of marine fish larvae, but rarely in statistical
   analyses of spatio-temporal observation data. Here, we examine the
   relative contribution of inter-annual variability in spawner
   distribution, advection by ocean currents, hydrography and climate in
   modifying observed distribution patterns of cod larvae in the
   Lofoten-Barents Sea. By integrating predictions from a particle-tracking
   model into a spatially explicit statistical analysis, the effects of
   advection and the timing and locations of spawning are accounted for.
   The analysis also includes other environmental factors: temperature,
   salinity, a convergence index and a climate threshold determined by the
   North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). We found that the spatial pattern of
   larvae changed over the two climate periods, being more upstream in low
   NAO years. We also demonstrate that spawning distribution and ocean
   circulation are the main factors shaping this distribution, while
   temperature effects are different between climate periods, probably due
   to a different spatial overlap of the fish larvae and their prey, and
   the consequent effect on the spatial pattern of larval survival. Our new
   methodological approach combines numerical and statistical modelling to
   draw robust inferences from observed distributions and will be of

Abstract = {{Economists, investors and policy makers need to understand the changing
   climate of energy systems and the potential for investment in both
   alternative energy supply and demand side efficiency and management
   technologies. Biophysical economics has contributed to conventional
   economics by incorporating thermodynamic and ecological principles and
   emphasising the importance of natural resources to the economic process.
   This paper is presented in two parts. Part 1 gives a historic review of
   biophysical economics and discusses some previous models of the
   energy-economy system built around the principles of biophysical
   economics. Part 2 presents the GEMBA model a - new modelling methodology
   in the biophysical economics tradition. The methodology proposes a new
   and important contribution to the field of biophysical economics; a
   lifetime evolving function for the dynamics of the energy return on
   investment (EROI). In the development stage of a new resource, EROI
   increases due to technological learning, market growth and capital
   investment. EROI then reaches a peak as diminishing returns are
   experienced on further technological innovation and capital investment.
   In the later stage EROI declines over time as the most accessible
   resources are developed first, resources become depleted, or scarcity
   develops for materials needed to extract, process or convert the energy
   for the market. EROI can also diminish over time as environmental
   restoration or emission reduction becomes required by the society. The
   dynamic EROI function was incorporated into a global energy model using
   a biophysical approach (GEMBA) and implemented in VenSim. The GEMBA
   model is calibrated using historical energy production data, i.e.
   training to historical data, then running the trained model to 2100
   under a series of varying assumptions regarding availability of energy
   resources and corresponding EROls. The main finding of the model is that
   growth of the renewable energy sector may impact investment in other
   areas of the economy and thereby stymie economic growth. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Growing concerns about significant biodiversity decline due to
   agricultural intensification are increasingly leading consumers to seek
   agricultural products that are produced sustainably. To raise awareness
   of sustainable land management and direct policy and research to
   mitigate adverse impacts, large-scale bird monitoring programmes are
   being used in Europe. New Zealand's first farmland bird monitoring
   scheme was established in 2004 to quantify bird abundance on 98 farms
   across three sectors (sheep \& beef, dairy and kiwifruit). Distance
   methods were considered ideal because they minimised disruption by
   nuisance variables that affected detectability (most often observer and
   whether birds were seen or heard; less frequently, effects of wind,
   habitat and farming systems). However, distance defection functions
   could only be measured for half the species present on the study farms,
   and sampling uncertainty remained high for several of those species.
   Gradually more species with reduced sampling uncertainty can be added as
   sufficient detections are gathered to generate their global detection
   functions. This will likely increase the scheme's power to detect any
   ongoing decline, but simulations that combine sampling uncertainty with
   observed inter-annual variation in abundance are now needed to test
   whether population-decline thresholds can be reliably detected using the

Title = {{Approaches towards nitrogen- and phosphorus-efficient rice}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims Food production has to increase to meet the demand
   of a growing population. In light of the high energy costs and
   increasingly scarce resources, future agricultural systems have to be
   more productive and more efficient in terms of inputs such as fertilizer
   and water. The development of rice varieties with high yield under
   low-nutrient conditions has therefore become a breeding priority. The
   rapid progress made in sequencing and molecular-marker technology is now
   beginning to change the way breeding is done, providing new
   opportunities.
   Scope Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are applied to agricultural
   systems in large quantities and a deficiency of either nutrient leads to
   yield losses and triggers complex molecular and physiological responses.
   The underlying genes are now being identified and studied in detail, and
   an increasing number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to N and
   P uptake and utilization are being reported. Here, we provide an
   overview of the different aspects related to N and P in rice production
   systems, and apply a breeder's perspective on the potential of relevant
   genes and pathways for breeding applications.
   Main points For the development of nutrient-efficient rice, a holistic
   approach should be followed combining optimized fertilizer management
   with enhanced nutrient uptake via a vigorous root system, leading to
   increased grain filling and yield. Despite an increasing number of N-
   and P-related genes and QTLs being reported, very few are actively used
   in molecular breeding programmes. The complex regulation of N- and
   P-related pathways challenges breeders and the research community to
   identify large-effect genes/QTLs. For this it will be important to focus
   more on the analysis of tolerant genotypes rather than model plants,
   since tolerance pathways may employ a different set of genes.}},

   management. In principle, the concept of a forest management approach
   provides a framework for decision making, including a range of
   silvicultural operations that influence the development of a stand or
   group of trees over time. These operations vary among silvicultural
   systems and can be formulated as a set of basic principles.
   Consequently, forest management approaches are essentially defined by
   coherent sets of forest operation processes at a stand level.
   Five ideal forest management approaches (FMAs) representing a gradient
   of management intensity are described using specific sets of basic
   principles that enable comparison across European forests. Each approach
   is illustrated by a regional European case study. The observed regional
   variations resulting from changing species composition, stand density,
   age structure, stand edges, and site conditions can be interpreted using
   the FMA framework.
   Despite being arranged along an intensity gradient, the forest
   management approaches are not considered to be mutually exclusive, as
   the range of options allows for greater freedom in selecting potential
   silvicultural operations. As derived goods and services are clearly
   affected, the five forest management approaches have implications for
   sustainability. Thus, management objectives can influence the balance
   between the economic, ecological, and social dimensions of
   sustainability. The utility of this framework is further demonstrated
   through the different contributions to this special issue.}},

Abstract = {{Since pollutant total amount control was introduced in China in the
   1980s, many researches have focused on water environmental capacity, the
   allocation of pollutant load, and the pollution discharge right trading.
   The allocation of water pollution load is the core as well as difficult
   point in total amount control system of water pollutants discharge.
   There are a series of objects for water pollutions load allocation,
   including water basin, the water function zoning, administrative units,
   sewage outlets and pollutant discharging points. For different objects
   of allocation, a distribution planning must be able to meet both the
   regional requirements and the benefits of pollutant discharging
   enterprises. However, it is difficult to meet the interests of various
   levels by one kind method of load allocation. This paper intends to
   establish a new multi-level load allocation system for Xi'an-Xianyang
   Section, Weihe River. With large population, concentrated industrial
   discharging, and poor water quality, the approach needs to consider both
   regional development requirements and pollutant discharging point's
   economic interests. At the same time, for different objects at various
   levels, there is proper different distribution method according to the
   principles of efficiency and fairness in allocation. For regional water
   function zoning to administrative units, the environmental Gini
   coefficient analysis for regional allocation is applied in economic
   sphere to set up an appropriate allocation model for the optimal
   allocation. For administrative units to sewage outlets, optimal
   generation performance standard (GPS) method for enterprises allocation
   is used to improve the emission performance. The model's objective will
   be changed from minimum cost to greatest value. The results showed that
   Xi'an and Xianyang City has four counties needed to reduce the pollution
   load largely, respectively, because they have some prominent
   contradiction with the social and economic developments and the natural
   environment. In addition, in the key reduction region the discharge
   units should be cut the distribution in accordance with the ratio of
   distribution model. While in the maintaining present conditions regions,
   discharge units will have some ``surplus capacity{''} for future
   emission control. This new approach for water total amount load is
   effective and may provide the foundation for the pollutant total amount
   control of Weihe River. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B. V. Selection

Abstract = {{Based on dissipative structure theory and ecological cybernetics, an
   ecological regulation approach at the town scale was developed, which
   was aimed at increasing system order and maintaining a healthy system by
   reducing the entropy of the urban ecosystem. First, considering the
   characteristics of the urban nature-economy-society complex ecosystem
   and entropy theory, the entropy of the urban ecosystem was defined as a
   state parameter indicating system disorder, and it could be divided into
   entropy flow and entropy production. Second, an entropy evaluation
   indicator system for the urban ecosystem was constructed by associating
   ecosystem characteristics at the town scale. Then, using Tongzhou
   district of Beijing City as an example and future city development
   planning objects and policies about national environmental protection
   and energy-saving and emission-reduction, adjustable indicators were
   selected, and a system entropy regulation approach was established.
   These indicators were easy to obtain and regulate with the purpose of
   reducing system entropy. Finally, via quantitative model of computing
   information entropy, we analyzed the entropy change of the urban
   ecosystem, as well as the harmonious degree and developmental degree in
   Tongzhou district for both the evaluation time period (2000-2007) and
   the planning year (2020). Our results indicated that after the
   regulation approach was brought into effect, the entropy flow, entropy
   production and total entropy substantially would reduce compared with
   the same variable during the evaluation period. Thus, system order can
   be significantly enhanced, and the regulation approach was proven to be
   effective. This study provides a new regulation approach to solve
   complex eco-environmental problems during the urbanization process. (C)

Abstract = {{Baojixia water diversion works have direct impacts on river hydrology,
   primarily resulting in the changes of the magnitude, frequency of low
   and high flows, ultimately generating a new hydrologic regime differing
   significantly from the natural flow regime. Streamflow and precipitation
   data from 1944 to 2008 at Linjiacun station are analyzed in this study.
   In order to evaluate hydrologic alteration before and after water
   diversion, the Range of Variability Approach (RVA) is used in this
   paper, and hydrologic data was divided into two periods: before and
   after 1972, when Baojixia diversion works brought to service in the Wei
   River. It is supposed that the hydrologic time series before 1972
   represents the hydrologic regime for the pre-impact period, and that
   after 1972 for the post-impact period. The Chi-square test is used to
   analyze the hydrologic alteration of monthly flows, which is classified
   as low, middle and high hydrologic alterations. Flow Duration Curve
   (FDC) representing the relationship between the magnitude and frequency
   of streamflow was used to investigate flow characteristics from low flow
   to high flow. FDC is categorized as three parts on the basis of
   magnitude of streamflow: high flow (below 10\% of exceedance frequency),
   low flow (over 90\% of exceedance frequency) and constant flow (from
   10\% to 90\% of exceedance frequency). The results show that the
   magnitude of monthly flow decreased obviously in the post-impact period,
   especially in dry seasons. The degree of hydrologic alteration is high.
   The shape of FDC in the post-impact period is different from that in the
   pre-impact period. There is an obvious trend for FDC in the pre-impact
   period, while there is no obvious regularity between magnitude of
   streamflow and exceedance probability in the post-impact period.
   According to the analysis on the data of water diversion, water
   withdrawn accounted for about 80 percent of natural runoff in dry
   seasons. This may be the reason why the alteration of monthly flow in
   dry seasons is highest. In summary, monthly streamflow after 1972
   changed greatly because of water diversion. This analysis makes one to
   understand hydrologic regime well, and will be helpful for the
   management of water resources in the Wei River basin. (C) 2011 Published

Abstract = {{Studying quantitative relationships between landscape pattern and water
   quality is a fundamental step to assess the impacts of non-point source
   pollution. Many hydrological models with multi-functionality have been
   developed as useful tools to study several key mechanisms in non-point
   source pollution. In landscape ecological studies, however, the
   empirical modelling approaches have been dominated with emphasis on the
   relationships between the landscape metrics and water quality indices.
   The main techniques for developing those models of landscape-water
   quality are statistical regression analysis based on linear models. In
   this article, Allometric models and the traditional multiple linear
   regression models for estimating the linkage between landscape metrics
   and water quality were tested in Sihu Basin, Hubei Province, China. The
   models at patch class level were established in 24 hydrological units of
   the basin, which took nine water quality indices (EC, pH, SS, DO, COD,
   TN, TP, NO3--N, NH4+-N) as the dependent variables and eighteen
   landscape metrics calculated in FRAGSTATS 3.3 as independent variables.
   The results suggested that, compared with the traditional multiple
   linear regression models, Allometric models were more suitable for SS,
   DO, TP, TN, NH4+-N, in which landscape pattern metrics could explain the
   80.5\%, 77.7\%, 58.2\%, 43.9\%, 67.6\% of total variation, respectively.
   There had little difference between multiple linear regression models
   and Allometric models for EC and NO3--N. The coefficients of
   determination in Allometric models were not as strong as that obtained
   in the multiple linear regression models for pH and COD. The above
   results indicated that using Allometric model may potentially provide a
   new way to study the linkage between landscape metrics and water quality
   indices, which will help protect our regional water resources. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The fast pace of urbanization puts stress on water resources. There are
   water shortages in many big cities. At the same time, the increase of
   impermeable surfaces makes floods more frequent. The conflict of water
   shortages and flood risk indicates that traditional stormwater

   runoff directly to streams and rivers, exacerbating pollutant inputs and
   hydrologic disturbances that result in the degradation of ecosystem
   structure and function. The new stormwater management techniques
   integrate stormwater collection, treatment, storage and reuse.
   Integrated management could be implemented on the roads, parking lots,
   depressed grassland and building roofs. This will reduce the runoff
   volume released by floods downstream, thereby reducing pollution and
   improving aquatic function. However, the integrated approach is just
   starting in many Chinese cities and there are lots of things to do. (C)

   efflux}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{4979-4991}},
Abstract = {{Respiration in tree stems is an important component of forest carbon
   balance. The rate of CO2 efflux from the stem has often been assumed to
   be a measure of stem respiration. However, recent work in temperate
   forests has demonstrated that stem CO2 efflux can either overestimate or
   underestimate respiration rate because of emission or removal of CO2 by
   transport in xylem water. Here, we studied gas exchange from stems of
   tropical forest trees using a new approach to better understand
   respiration in an ecosystem that plays a key role in the global carbon
   cycle. Our main questions were (1) is internal CO2 transport important
   in tropical trees, and, if so, (2) does this transport result in net
   release of CO2 respired in the roots at the stem, or does it cause the
   opposite effect of net removal of stem-respired CO2? To answer these
   questions, we measured the ratio of stem CO2 efflux to O-2 influx. This
   ratio, defined here as apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ), is expected
   to equal 1.0 if carbohydrates are the substrate for respiration, and the
   net transport of CO2 in the xylem water is negligible. Using a stem
   chamber approach to quantifying ARQ, we found values of 0.66 +/- 0.18.
   These low ARQ values indicate that a large portion of respired CO2
   (similar to 35 \%) is not emitted locally, and is probably transported
   upward in the stem. ARQ values of 0.21 +/- 0.10 were found for the
   steady-state gas concentration within the stem, sampled by in-stem
   equilibration probes. These lower values may result from the proximity
   to the xylem water stream. In contrast, we found ARQ values of 1.00 +/-
   0.13 for soil respiration. Our results indicate the existence of a
   considerable internal flux of CO2 in the stems of tropical trees. If the
   transported CO2 is used in the canopy as a substrate for photosynthesis,
   it could account for up to 10\% of the C fixed by the tree, and perhaps
   serve as a mechanism that buffers the response of the tree to changing
   CO2 levels. Our results also indicate, in agreement with previous work,
   that the widely used CO2 efflux approach for determining stem
   respiration is unreliable. We demonstrate here a field applicable
   approach for measuring the O-2 uptake rate, which we suggest to be a
   more appropriate method to estimate stem respiration rates.}},

Abstract = {{Panarchy theory focuses on improving theories of change in natural and
   social systems to improve the design of policy responses. Its central
   thesis is that successfully working with the dynamic forces of complex
   adaptive natural and social systems demands an active adaptive
   management regime that eschews optimization approaches that seek
   stability. This is a new approach to resources management, and yet no
   new theory of how to do things in environmental and natural resources
   management, particularly one challenging entrenched ways of doing things
   and the interests aligned around them, is likely to gain traction in
   practice if it cannot gain traction in the form of endorsement and
   implementation through specific laws and regulations. At some point,
   that bridge must be crossed or the enterprise of putting panarchy theory
   into panarchy practice will stall. Any effort to operationalize panarchy
   theory through law thus comes up against the mission of law to provide
   social stability and the nature of law itself as a complex adaptive
   system. To state the problem in another way, putting panarchy theory
   into practice will require adaptively managing the complex adaptive
   legal system to adaptively manage other complex adaptive natural and

Title = {{Exploring Panarchy in Alpine Grasslands: an Application of Adaptive
   Cycle Concepts to the Conservation of a Cultural Landscape}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This paper explores approaches of applying the panarchy perspective to a
   case study of natural resource management in the cultural landscape of
   upland alpine pastures in northern Italy. The close interaction within
   the cultural landscape between alpine pasture ecology and the management
   regimes offers a strong fit with the concept of social-ecological
   systems and provides insights to appropriate and adaptive management of
   sites of conservation interest. We examine the limited literature
   available that offers a resilience understanding of such landscapes and
   address apparent gaps in the application through our interpretation and
   use of adaptive cycles and panarchy. We draft conceptual models of
   adaptive cycles considering ecological and socioeconomic information as
   acting in separate but interacting domains. Notwithstanding the
   difficulties in defining and measuring quantitative state variables, we
   found that a panarchy model can offer a powerful metaphor with practical
   implications for the maintenance of such alpine cultural landscapes. In
   effect, our panarchy interpretation of interacting adaptive cycles
   provides new insights into the description of and the future options for
   land use in our case study area. Some issues are only partly developed.
   We hypothesized measurable parameters that could be related to system
   resilience, such as alternative states, shifting thresholds, and regime
   stability, which are all dependent on adaptive processes; but we found
   quantification difficult even at a conceptual level. Nevertheless, we
   found it helpful to use nature conservation evaluation as a useful
   surrogate for measures of capital in adaptive cycles of vegetation.
   However, care is needed to distinguish between the descriptive metaphor
   using selective surrogate measures and real ecological behavior.
   Additionally we recognize the need to integrate this ecological
   understanding with cycles in socioeconomic domains and consider that
   interactions between the loss of both social and ecological capital
   would be interesting issues to explore further in our case study.
   We suggest that resilience theory, through its focus on adaptive cycles
   interacting at different speeds and across varying geographic scales,
   offers useful insights into resource management and in particular for
   nature conservation interest sites, by focusing more on dynamics than on
   an optimal state of species assemblages. This may help to define sites
   and to achieve the objectives of Natura 2000 through the European
   Habitats Directive, offering a basis to guide a conservation of
   processes, in which cultural tradition and local ecological knowledge
   are valued.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding forest succession is required when designing management
   strategies, analyzing forest functioning, and forecasting the effects of
   changes in disturbance regime of forests. However, assigning a certain
   successional stage to forests in nature is challenging, especially when
   long-lived tree species dominate succession. Temperate rainforests
   commonly harbor emergent pioneer trees with long lifespans (>500 years)
   and may persist even when forest have reached stability in tree species
   composition (compositional equilibrium) and stability in structure (e.g.
   biomass). Thus, it is difficult to locate stands along a successional
   trajectory. Here, we propose a method for identifying the successional
   stages of forests using a dynamic forest model that estimate the time
   taken for a forest to reach the late successional stage, i.e. when
   forests have reached stability. Using this method, we examined the
   successional stages of 13 old, unmanaged stands of temperate rainforests
   located on Chiloe Island (Chile, 42 degrees S). We parameterized the
   model for 17 tree species using field data and a comprehensive
   literature search. The model predicted varied successional pathways for
   reproducing the observed structural variability of studied forests
   stands. Model results suggest that forests in this region can take
   490-850 years to reach the late successional stage. We found 6 out of
   the 13 studied forests represent a transient successional stage. Forest
   stands in the late successional stage commonly contained pioneer species
   with basal area <20 m(2)/ha. According to our simulations, pioneers can
   persist until the late successional stage because of their long
   lifespans and the occurrence of small canopy openings (<1.6 ha) produced
   by windstorms. Above-ground biomass in the studied forests (estimated at
   539 t/ha, average among stands) tended to decrease as forests approach
   the late successional stage because large pioneers are replaced by
   smaller late-successional trees. These results can assist in the
   classification of natural forest according to their successional stages
   as well as in developing management and conservation strategies of
   primary forests in this region. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{457}},
Pages = {{43-66}},
Abstract = {{The Clarence River Estuary is the largest estuary in southeast
   Australia, with an extensive floodplain encompassing multiple river
   channels and a large coastal lagoon. It is the focus of major commercial
   and recreational fisheries and there is pressure to divert its
   freshwater inputs for agricultural and domestic uses. We used a spatial
   biogeochemical model to simulate the variability and evolution of this
   system on timescales from days to decades over the past half century.
   Like most tropical and subtropical estuaries, the Clarence River Estuary
   is strongly influenced by river discharge, sediment and nutrient loads.
   Given the high nutrient loads arriving from the upper catchment,
   plankton biomasses in the model were typically limited by flushing
   through the estuary channels. However, the longer residence times of the
   lagoons produced a profoundly different regime where higher zooplankton
   concentrations were supported by recycling of nutrients and detritus.
   Using alternative model scenarios, it was found that the ecology of the
   lagoon was sensitive to changes in land-use and urbanization within the
   local sub-catchment, but was largely insensitive to changes in upstream
   river discharge (i.e. rainfall or freshwater extraction). The opposite
   was true in the estuary channels, where changes in land-use or
   urbanisation in the populated lower catchment had little effect on the
   estuarine ecology, while even modest reductions in river discharges
   dramatically increased the biomass of the smaller phytoplankton and
   zooplankton groups, and favoured benthic algae over seagrass and
   macroalgae. The contrasting responses of these 2 estuarine environments
   suggests the need for distinct management approaches, with stringent
   controls on nutrient loads into coastal lagoons and protection of
   environmental flows into estuary channels.}},

Pages = {{141-150}},
Abstract = {{Two conservation tools have been developed over the last 10-15 years for
   species on the New Zealand mainland that are vulnerable to introduced
   mammalian predators: landscape-scale predator trapping networks, and
   eradication of predators within mammal-proof exclosures. We tested
   whether these tools would allow population growth of critically
   endangered grand skinks (Oligosoma grande) and Otago skinks (O.
   otagense) over three years. Skink populations were subjected to one of
   three predator treatments: (1) near-eradication inside a mammal-proof
   fence; (2) suppression by trapping within a 2100-ha area; and (3)
   unmanaged predator populations. Monitoring by non-invasive photo-resight
   methods, and data analysis using program MARK, showed that the greatest
   increase in abundance of both species occurred at the centre of the
   predator trapping treatment and inside a mammal-proof fence. For grand
   skinks, there was little or no change in population size at the trapping
   periphery. At the unmanaged sites, the grand skink population underwent
   a catastrophic decline whereas the Otago skink population was stable. A
   grouping analysis showed that the unmanaged grand skink treatment was
   clearly distinguished from the other predator treatments based on
   survival rate. Results suggest that: (1) predation by introduced mammals
   is a key driver in the decline of these skinks, and episodic predation
   events may be a component of this process; and (2) use of mammal-proof
   fences or intensive predator control over a large enough area should
   allow skink populations to recover.}},

Pages = {{243-251}},
Abstract = {{The biodiversity conservation task in New Zealand is considerable and
   complex, and effective prioritisation of conservation work, informative
   reporting, and efficient, well-targeted data gathering are essential. We
   propose an approach to biodiversity assessment for organisations
   implementing biodiversity conservation work in New Zealand that unifies
   (1) biodiversity conservation work prioritisation, (2) reporting on
   trend and difference made to biodiversity, and (3) gathering relevant
   biodiversity data for both. We argue that prioritisation and reporting
   are reciprocal assessment activities that share information needs and
   are best served by a common framework that links the current state of
   biodiversity and expectations of future persistence with pressures (e.g.
   habitat clearance, weeds and pests) and human conservation activities
   ('biodiversity conservation work', e.g. legal protection, pest control,
   restoration). We describe ideas that might underpin the approach,
   including diminishing returns, irreplaceability, and vulnerability. We
   distinguish reporting of net achievement (biodiversity change or trend)
   from reporting of difference made to biodiversity by conservation work,
   and argue that the latter is a basis for both prioritisation and
   reporting in operational conservation organisations. A unified approach
   to prioritisation and reporting would help clarify management
   organisations' total requirements for biodiversity inventory, monitoring

   approach in a variety of ways, but a shared approach to gathering the
   essential information would benefit all stakeholders.}},

Title = {{A Geographic Model to Assess and Limit Cumulative Ecological Degradation
   from Marcellus Shale Exploitation in New York, USA}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{When natural resources are exploited, environmental costs and economic
   benefits are often asymmetric. An example is apparent in the
   environmental impacts from fossil fuel extraction by hydraulic
   fracturing. So far, most scrutiny has been focused on water quality in
   affected aquifers, with less attention paid to broader ecological
   impacts beyond individual drilling operations. Marcellus Shale methane
   exploitation in New York State, USA, has been delayed because of a
   regulatory moratorium, pending evaluation that has been directed
   primarily at localized impacts. We developed a GIS-based model, built on
   a hexagonal grid underlay nested within the U. S. Environmental
   Protection Agency's EMAP system, to examine potential cumulative
   ecological impacts. In a two-step process, we characterized > 19,000
   hexagons, each sized to approximate the footprint of one drilling site
   (2.57 km(2)), using ecological attributes; we then developed a method
   for apportioning resource access that includes assessments of cumulative
   ecological costs. Over one-quarter of the hexagons were excluded as
   off-limits on the basis of six criteria: slope suitability, regulated
   wetland cover, protected-land cover, length of high-quality streams,
   mapped road density, and open water cover. Three additional criteria
   were applied to assess the estimated conservation vulnerability of the
   remaining sites: density of grassland birds (North American Breeding
   Bird Survey), percent core forest (Coastal Change Analysis Program), and
   total density of all state-mapped streams; these were determined and
   used in combination to rank the 14,000 potentially accessible sites. In
   a second step, an iterative process was used to distribute potential
   site access among all towns (sub-county governments) within the
   Marcellus Shale Formation. At each iteration, one site was selected per
   town, either randomly or in rank order of increasing vulnerability.
   Results were computed as percent cumulative impact versus the number of
   sites committed and compared to a most-conservative selection process
   (ranked by statewide conservation vulnerability). Random selection with
   proportional distribution by town resulted in larger cumulative
   ecological impacts, but rank-ordered selection by town was in many ways
   comparable to selection by statewide conservation vulnerability ranking.
   These outcomes allow for a political solution for managing resource
   access fairly, based on a balanced geographic distribution of economic
   benefits, coupled with an underlying scientific basis for assessing the
   ecological costs that are publicly shared.}},

   Objectives and Cost-Effectiveness}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The Oder (Szczecin) Lagoon in the southern Baltic Sea is a heavily
   eutrophicated and degraded coastal ecosystem. We applied a systems
   approach framework to critically evaluate whether existing
   water-management measures achieve water-quality objectives for the river
   and lagoon systems. Our simulations reveal that the existing
   water-quality objectives for the river and the coastal waters are not
   sufficiently complementary. We suggest new water-quality threshold
   concentrations, which are in agreement with the European Water Framework
   Directive, and we calculate acceptable maximum nutrient loads for the
   Oder River. These calculations suggest that external nutrient-load
   reductions in the river basin alone seem insufficient to achieve good
   water quality in the lagoon. A comprehensive eutrophication management
   approach should also include internal nutrient-retention and
   nutrient-removal measures in the lagoon. We focus on mussel farming,
   i.e., that of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, because they are
   efficient in removing nutrients and improving water transparency in the
   Oder Lagoon. For this purpose, the ecosystem model ERGOM is extended by
   a mussel module and an economic model. The economic model describes
   costs and benefits of mussel cultivation depending on the the farm size.
   We included additional potential sources of income such as water-quality
   tax or emission certificates. The simulations show that mussel farming
   in the lagoon is a suitable supportive measure and, at a load-reduction
   target of 50\% or more, it is a cost-efficient measure for removing
   nutrients and for implementing the Baltic Sea Action Plan. In the Oder
   Lagoon, mussel farming could potentially remove nearly 1000 t of N (70 t
   of P)/year, or about 2\% of the present N and P loads, and it would have
   the additional benefit of improving water transparency.}},

Title = {{Demographic transition among hunters: a temporal analysis of hunter
   recruitment dedication and motives in Denmark}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{446-451}},
Abstract = {{Context. In many countries, hunting has emerged as a major source of
   funding for wildlife conservation and research or habitat acquisition.
   In some countries, recent declines in recruitment of hunters have
   generated concerns about the consequences of the rapid demographic
   change within society in general, and among hunters in particular.
   Gaining a better understanding of how these demographic changes
   influence dedication to and motivation for hunting has therefore become
   an important task.
   Aims. Our aims included documenting the demographic transition among
   Danish hunters, and identifying correlates of hunter recruitment age,
   motivations and dedication.
   Methods. We addressed these aims using a national survey of Danish
   hunters in 2000 (n = 1186) and 2006 (n = 701). Survey data were analysed
   using multiple regression models.
   Key results. Whereas recruitment numbers remained stable, the average
   age of recruitment for hunters increased from 21 to 34 between 1984 and
   2006, and the percentage of new hunters younger than 20 declined from
   63\% to 19\% during the same period. Respondents who hunted to
   experience nature were recruited at older ages than other hunters.
   Recruitment age was negatively related to number of days hunting per
   year and relative importance placed on hunting as a recreational
   activity, and positively related to being recruited by friends, female
   gender, being married, and having an urban childhood.
   Conclusions. The global demographic transition towards an older and more
   urban populace may drive a change in hunter demographics rather than a
   decline of hunting.
   Implications. The present study suggests that hunting can persist in the
   face of rapid demographic change. However, the study also indicates
   several important structural barriers for new hunters, favouring those
   hunters being economically most well off and leading to a decline in
   hunting dedication. To meet these challenges, the study suggests that
   modifications will be needed in hunter education programs and hunter
   recruitment campaigns, so as to maintain hunting as a significant
   positive factor within wildlife conservation.}},

   multivariate time-lag approach}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{456}},
Pages = {{159-168}},
Abstract = {{We used long-term juvenile abundance data (2000 to 2010) of dominant
   fish species in 2 coastal habitats of Southern Brazil to test a novel
   adaptation of traditional multivariate analyses, as an alternative for
   evaluating the lag in species response relative to the changes in
   environmental variables. We investigated the hypothesis that the
   recruitment response to changes in environmental variables is not
   immediate. This new approach consisted of traditional multivariate
   analysis (e. g. canonical redundancy analysis) using an explanatory
   matrix composed of original and lagged environmental variables, and the
   performance of this analysis was assessed by comparison with traditional
   univariate time-lag analysis. Both the univariate and multivariate
   time-lag analyses showed similar results, but the multivariate approach
   had advantages and is presented as a useful and uncomplicated
   alternative to conduct time-lag analysis using a multivariate ecological
   dataset. Marine and estuarine recruitment processes were better
   explained by lagged temperature (predominant lags of 1 and 2 mo,
   respectively) than by in-phase (i.e. time lag = 0) temperature. In
   contrast, other environmental variables (transparency, salinity and
   freshwater outflow) did not show significant delays. Hence, our findings
   show that the species response to environmental variables is not
   immediate, especially for temperature. Rather, the time lag elapsed
   between the changes in abiotic factors and juvenile abundance is
   mediated by ecological and hydrological processes. Our study reaffirms
   the importance of time-lag analyses as a tool for better understanding
   of the temporal dynamics of estuarine and marine recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability, as a new concept, has been adopted recently in the world
   of architecture, related to new technical utilities and new assessment
   environmental methods. At the same time, several eco-logics have been
   developed, according to a new approach from the world of energy,
   resources and health. After that, economical and social items have been
   summed up. From an aesthetical and expressive point of view, the
   architecture based in this new paradigm has not developed a new common
   language yet, which is still diverse, confused and non identifiable, but
   the trend in the future will establish new formal and coherent
   initiatives.
   Eventually, all activities related to the world of architecture and
   construction are creating a holistic approach from an environmental
   viewpoint, which will be a really important matter for the human habitat
   in the future, according to the actual trend. The economics and social
   items related to architecture are showing that the environmental
   conscience must be spread not only to market and economical diplomacy,
   but to education, participation, and ethics too. The approach, then, is
   finally global, holistic and focused on values.
   This scenario rooted to values means that the environmental awareness
   will be placed in a very significant position, in opposition to the last
   age, in which the technical pattern was one of the predominant,
   overestimated values. Hazards and impacts from Human activities over
   Nature are now essentially analyzed in every discipline, including
   construction and architecture. That means that what is really changing
   in the construction world is not only science or technology. What are
   changing are the values, which turned up from the sense of man as the
   centre of the universe to Nature in a first place, in harmony with
   non-anthropocentric values. This conviction can help to address the new
   focuses for new research and action plans to continue in analyzing the
   new paradigm of sustainability.}},

Title = {{Can REDD plus Reconcile Local Priorities and Needs with Global
   Mitigation Benefits? Lessons from Angai Forest, Tanzania}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{The scope of the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest
   degradation (REDD) mechanism has broadened REDD+ to accommodate
   different country interests such as natural forests, protected areas, as
   well as forests under community-based management. In Tanzania the REDD+
   mechanism is still under development and pilot projects are at an early
   stage. In this paper, we seek to understand how local priorities and
   needs could be met in REDD+ implementation and how these expectations
   match with global mitigation benefits. We examine the local priorities
   and needs in the use of land and forest resources in the Angai Villages
   Land Forest Reserve (AVLFR) in the Liwale District of Lindi Region in
   Tanzania. Primary data was collected in two villages, Mihumo and
   Lilombe, using semistructured key informant interviews and participatory
   rural appraisal methods. In addition, the key informant interviews were
   conducted with other village, district, and national level actors, as
   well as international donors. Findings show that in the two communities
   REDD+ is seen as something new and is generating new expectations among
   communities. However, the Angai villagers highlight three key priorities
   that have yet to be integrated into the design of REDD+: water scarcity,
   rural development, and food security. At the local level improved forest
   governance and sustainable management of forest resources have been
   identified as one way to achieve livelihood diversification. Although
   the national goals of REDD+ include poverty reduction, these goals are
   not necessarily conducive to the goals of these communities. There exist
   both structural and cultural limits to the ability of the Angai villages
   to implement these goals and to improve forestry governance. Given the
   vulnerability to current and future climate variability and change it
   will be important to consider how the AVLFR will be managed and for
   whose benefit?}},

Abstract = {{New observations of the vertically integrated CO2 mixing ratio,
   aYCO(2)aY (c), from ground-based remote sensing show that variations in
   CO(2)aY (c) are primarily determined by large-scale flux patterns. They
   therefore provide fundamentally different information than observations
   made within the boundary layer, which reflect the combined influence of
   large-scale and local fluxes. Observations of both aYCO(2)aY (c) and CO2
   concentrations in the free troposphere show that large-scale spatial
   gradients induce synoptic-scale temporal variations in aYCO(2)aY (c) in
   the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes through horizontal advection.
   Rather than obscure the signature of surface fluxes on atmospheric CO2,
   these synoptic-scale variations provide useful information that can be
   used to reveal the meridional flux distribution. We estimate the
   meridional gradient in aYCO(2)aY (c) from covariations in aYCO(2)aY (c)
   and potential temperature, theta, a dynamical tracer, on synoptic
   timescales to evaluate surface flux estimates commonly used in carbon
   cycle models. We find that simulations using Carnegie Ames Stanford
   Approach (CASA) biospheric fluxes underestimate both the aYCO(2)aY (c)
   seasonal cycle amplitude throughout the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes
   and the meridional gradient during the growing season. Simulations using
   CASA net ecosystem exchange (NEE) with increased and phase-shifted
   boreal fluxes better fit the observations. Our simulations suggest that
   climatological mean CASA fluxes underestimate boreal growing season NEE
   (between 45-65A degrees N) by \~{}40\%. We describe the implications for
   this large seasonal exchange on inference of the net Northern Hemisphere
   terrestrial carbon sink.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{445}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Abstract = {{Body size determines the position of organisms in plankton food webs.
   The mass or diameter ratio between predators and their optimal prey is
   therefore a central element of size-based models, which attempt to link
   consumer groups across trophic levels. Despite a renaissance of
   size-based approaches in plankton ecology, however, this relation still
   lacks a generic and also mechanistically sound formulation. An
   empirically derived constant value of this ratio cannot describe the
   wide scatter in optimal prey diameter for specific predator size
   classes, especially in the mesozooplankton range. In this study, I
   propose that a given morphometric ratio between feeding-related
   apparatus and total body volume decreases when predator size increases.
   This ratio decrease is due to the additional need for structural
   components in larger organisms for maintaining intra-body transport.
   Non-isometric scaling results in a non-linear dependency of optimal prey
   size on predator diameter. This dependency defines an average relation
   which enables the quantitative definition of feeding mode. This new
   trait variable explains a component of the variability in optimal prey
   diameter that is independent of predator diameter. Feeding mode as a
   trait can be interpreted as activity during grazing, mostly in terms of
   speed regulation in swimming or in feeding-current generation. Feeding
   mode, in concert with the classical trait predator size, accurately
   determines optimal prey size. This was extensively tested using
   literature data for the entire plankton domain. The theory predicts
   increasing feeding activity in larger consumer species. It elucidates
   how successional shifts in the composition of zooplankton communities
   are linked to weakly coupled changes in mean body size and feeding mode.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Traditionally, marine ecosystem structure was thought to be bottom-up
   controlled. In recent years, a number of studies have highlighted the
   importance of top-down regulation. Evidence is accumulating that the
   type of trophic forcing varies temporally and spatially, and an
   integrated view considering the interplay of both types of control is
   emerging. Correlations between time series spanning several decades of
   the abundances of adjacent trophic levels are conventionally used to
   assess the type of control: bottom-up if positive or top-down if this is
   negative. This approach implies averaging periods which might show
   time-varying dynamics and therefore can hide part of this temporal
   variability. Using spatially referenced plankton information extracted
   from the Continuous Plankton Recorder, this study addresses the
   potential dynamic character of the trophic structure at the planktonic
   level in the North Sea by assessing its variation over both temporal and
   spatial scales. Our results show that until the early-1970s a bottom-up
   control characterized the base of the food web across the whole North
   Sea, with diatoms having a positive and homogeneous effect on
   zooplankton filter-feeders. Afterwards, different regional trophic
   dynamics were observed, in particular a negative relationship between
   total phytoplankton and zooplankton was detected off the west coast of
   Norway and the Skagerrak as opposed to a positive one in the southern
   reaches. Our results suggest that after the early 1970s diatoms remained
   the main food source for zooplankton filter-feeders east of
   OrkneyShetland and off Scotland, while in the east, from the Norwegian
   Trench to the German Bight, filter-feeders were mainly sustained by
   dinoflagellates.}},

Pages = {{277-289}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Over the next century, changes in the global climate are expected to
   have major consequences for plant communities, possibly including the
   exacerbation of species invasions. We evaluated this possibility in the
   grass flora of California, which is economically and ecologically
   important and heavily invaded. We used a novel, trait-based approach
   involving two components: identifying differences in trait composition
   between native and exotic components of the grass flora and evaluating
   contemporary traitclimate relationships across the state. The
   combination of traitclimate relationships and trait differences between
   groups allows us to predict changes in the exotic-native balance under
   climate change scenarios. Exotic species are more likely to be annual,
   taller, with larger leaves, larger seeds, higher specific leaf area, and
   higher leaf N percentage than native species. Across the state, all
   these traits are associated with regions with higher temperature.
   Therefore, we predict that increasing temperatures will favor trait
   states that tend to be possessed by exotic species, increasing the
   dominance of exotic species. This prediction is corroborated by the
   current distribution of exotic species richness relative to native
   richness in California; warmer areas contain higher proportions of
   exotic species. This pattern was very well captured by a simple model
   that predicts invasion severity given only the traitclimate relationship
   for native species and trait differences between native and exotic
   species. This study provides some of the first evidence for an important
   interaction between climate change and species invasions across very
   broad geographic and taxonomic scales.}},

   posterior sample into an estimate of the parameters of interest. We use

Abstract = {{The boreal vegetation of the sub-Arctic comprises more than 30\% of the
   Earth's forest area and plays a major role in controlling the global
   environment. In the 20th century the boreal vegetation of Fennoscandia
   was significantly changed by heavy industrialisation leaving many forest
   areas damaged or dying. Due to severe climate conditions of the
   sub-Arctic such vegetation changes are traceable over long periods of
   time. This provides an opportunity to study all types of human impact on
   vegetation in time and to develop methods to monitor geographical and
   structural changes in the vegetation cover. Here we present the first
   part of a larger study in which we use the remote sensing technique to
   investigate the dynamics of the boreal vegetation in Fennoscandia in
   context of human impact. We have developed a novel method for an
   automated analysis and mapping of vegetation and of all types of human
   impact based on a single support-vector-machines classifier (for the
   whole area). Implemented with free and open source software the method
   uses Landsat TM and ETM+ band data (for which it automatically performs
   atmospheric correction) and a number of indices like NDVI, NBR, etc. The
   accuracy of the 16-class classification has been assessed using field
   data and literature sources and determined to be 74.1\%. The method has
   been successfully applied to a study area around Monchegorsk, Kola
   peninsula, Russia, the most industrialised part of northern Europe. We
   have characterised all major types of human impact on the boreal forest
   and tundra vegetation performing the change detection analysis in an
   area of 1750 km(2) between 1986 and 2005. The analysis has confirmed
   industrial atmospheric pollutions as the primary type of human impact
   here. We have discussed the role of forest fires and uncovered temporal
   trends in the vegetation cover. We have found that during the 19 years
   covered by the study more than one third of all coniferous forest in the
   area was transformed primarily to wetland, deciduous forest and typical
   tundra vegetation. The success of the method in this area allows us to
   extend the study to the rest of Fennoscandia and look at large scale
   changes in the boreal vegetation cover.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem-based management rests upon a scientific foundation involving
   greater structural complexity and larger spatial and temporal scales of
   predictive models. Increases in complexity and scale impose constraints
   upon the extent to which complexity at the level of an organism (life
   history, behavior, and physiology) can be modeled. Although the earliest
   ecosystem models, notably Ecopath and its successors, eliminated much
   organismal detail and instead adopted a biomass dynamic approach, newer
   models such as Atlantis and multispedes virtual population analysis
   retain greater detail at the organismal level. However, effective
   ecosystem-based management will require appreciation of the limitations
   of complex models and reliance upon parallel insights on key processes
   gained through empirical research that are not captured by models. These
   insights should be used to evaluate differences between model
   predictions and management outcomes, modify models where possible, and
   adjust management measures suggested by models otherwise. Important
   empirical research at the organismal level includes effects of habitat,
   contaminants, and physical and chemical properties of water on
   organismal traits. It is then important to understand reciprocal effects
   of those changes on the ecosystem (e.g., temperature-driven changes in
   growth that alter trophic interactions). Intrapopulation variability in
   life history traits, behavior, and physiology can increase resilience to
   ecosystem change, and those benefits and processes that erode that
   variability need to be understood. Ultimately, the continued evolution
   toward ecosystem-based science and management should strive for a
   balance between reality and tractability in underlying models and
   incorporate empirical research in addition to model outputs to best
   shape management measures.}},

   and reproduce themselves) are operating simultaneously at different
   scales. This implies that changes in the characteristics of parts,
   defined at the local scale, and changes in the characteristics of the
   whole, defined at the large scale can only be obtained after
   establishing a scaling mechanism in the analysis. In order to deal with
   the issue of scale in energy accounting, we propose to make a
   distinction between three different categories: (i) primary energy
   sources (PES) - establishing a link between energy quantities and the
   associated requirement of biophysical gradients, at the large scale, on
   the interface black-box/context; (ii) energy carriers (EC) - defining
   the set of energy inputs required by technical devices for expressing
   useful functions, at the local scale, within the parts operating inside
   the black-box; (iii) end uses (EU) the set of functions to be expressed
   by society across hierarchical levels for reproducing itself. Finally,
   the paper presents examples of quantitative results obtained using an
   innovative method of analysis Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of
   Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM). We conclude that by using
   this new accounting method it is possible to generate a better
   understanding of external and internal constraints determining the
   desirability and viability of the metabolic pattern of societies. (C)

Abstract = {{It is the aim of plant functional research to generate general rules of
   species assembly and species reactions based on plant functional traits.
   Here we determined plant functional groups that are important with
   regard to land use types (grazing, mowing, mulching, burning,
   abandonment) and looked for mechanisms leading to changes in species
   composition after management changes in calcareous grasslands.
   To filter out the set of traits which best described the variation in
   plant composition along the studied land use gradient and to identify
   functional groups we chose an iterative three-table ordination method.
   We included traits related to persistence as well as traits describing
   the germination niche of a plant. To gain insight into underlying
   mechanisms which led to differing importance of these plant functional
   groups at different management regimes we investigated shifts in
   dominance of the identified functional groups at eight management
   regimes using long-term vegetation data of a site which was grazed
   before the onset of different management regimes in 1974. Ongoing
   unidirectional changes in cover of the four determined functional groups
   at most of the treatments indicated that even after almost 30 years new
   equilibria of functional group composition were still not reached.
   The study showed that other management treatments but grazing and mowing
   led to changes in functional group composition, which were mainly driven
   by increasing dominance of a highly competitive species group. (C) 2011

   northern Sierra Madre Oriental during the Last Glacial Maximum provide
   evidence for the expansion of pine-oak habitat across the Central

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1422-1431}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. The harmful effects of landscape change on species reproduction may
   be direct when habitat loss and fragmentation affect individual
   performance within habitat remnants, but also indirect when reproductive
   collapse derives from the effect of landscape alterations on population
   traits. Although the distinction between direct and indirect effects is
   crucial for the effective management of species, studies looking at both
   are scarce. 2. To assess the mechanisms and the temporal consistency of
   landscape change effects on reproduction, we quantified flowering,
   fruiting and seed set of the perennial herb Primula vulgaris through a
   gradient of forest loss and fragmentation, in
   2 years with different climatic conditions. We used structural equation
   modelling to relate, at the landscape scale, forest habitat availability
   and subdivision, forest edge length, population size and subdivision,
   and flower, fruit and seed production. We also evaluated the effects of
   light availability, plant abundance and aggregation on reproduction at
   the local scale.
   3. Flower and fruit production decreased in landscape regions with lower
   forest habitat availability, and fruit production decreased in areas
   with a smaller amount of forest edge. There was also a negative indirect
   effect of habitat loss on seed production, through population size
   reduction. These effects mostly emerged at the landscape scale and
   operated in all reproductive stages, but were also transmitted across
   stages, as flower and fruit production quantitatively influenced seed
   output.
   4. Landscape change effects on reproduction differed between the 2
   years, becoming evident after a mild winter that favoured long-lasting
   flowering, but disappearing, or even changing sign, when winter
   harshness shortened flowering.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Disentangling the relative importance of
   direct and indirect effects of landscape change in plant reproduction is
   a novel approach to distinguishing between populations and habitats as
   the required management targets. In our study system, increasing P.
   vulgaris population sizes within small forest patches seems less
   effective than increasing forest cover around existing populations (even
   small ones), to enhance individual reproduction. The contrasting effects
   of the different processes of landscape change and the potential
   additive role of climatic variability must also be considered in
   management purposes.}},

   with nature}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Maintaining and protecting biodiversity for the future under changing
   environmental and sociopolitical conditions is a major challenge.
   Scenarios are used as decision-making aids for natural resource
   management at local to global scales. Scenarios are underutilised by
   conservationists at a local level, where they can be highly effective
   for anticipating change.
   2. People's values and attitudes are crucial in determining the future,
   yet they are rarely placed at the centre of scenario exercises. Novel
   methods have been developed to fully integrate people's worldviews into
   scenario planning. The ethnographic futures framework focuses on how
   changes occur through human agency and how they will be felt by society
   in the future. The three horizons approach considers how different ideas
   and paradigms become more, or less, dominant in society over time.
   3. Natural England (NE), the statutory adviser to the UK Government on
   the natural environment in England, carried out a scenario planning
   process using these novel approaches. The scenarios consider a wide
   range of global and local factors and investigate their impact upon the
   natural environment in England, to 2060.
   4. A set of four contrasting scenarios was produced. Despite their
   differences, nature was always highly valued in some form; ultimately,
   the state of the natural environment was determined not by natural
   forces but by societal choice.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Scenario planning allows the development
   of key visions for the future. These can be used to establish, and
   influence, the direction of future trends and their impacts on the
   natural environment, particularly in the context of a shifting basis for
   conservation policy that seeks to enhance ecological resilience. The
   scenarios are being used within NE to help local communities shape the
   future of their natural environment; this process can be utilised by
   governments or environmental agencies elsewhere. This study demonstrates
   that across a range of scenarios the future state of the natural
   environment is very much a matter of societal choice. Decision-making
   frameworks for environmental conservation must take proper account of
   ecological knowledge, societal values, foresight and complexity.}},

Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{335-346}},

Abstract = {{The semi-natural landscapes of Mediterranean mountains underwent a
   remarkable land abandonment in the past decades. These large
   perturbation-dependent landscapes then evolved into new meta-stable
   states to balance human pressures and natural components with a general
   pattern homogenisation and several consequences on landscape services.
   These areas need effective management strategies to conserve a wide
   functionality allowing, at the same time, the sustainable development of
   population. Lack of resources and achievable restoration goals often
   hamper these objectives to be reached.
   In this paper, a study of pattern change is proposed using five
   landscape metrics and a stability analysis of features derived from land
   cover maps in order to investigate their magnitude and rate of change in
   a mountain municipality of central Italy between two separate time
   periods (1954-1985 and 1985-1999). A Kappa statistic (Kappa Index of
   Agreement), a Markov chain model and a Kruskal-Wallis test were
   employed. The results showed that shape and size of woodlands, open
   areas and buildings patches were significantly changed during the second
   period (1985-1999), with a concurrent abrupt reduction in the rate of
   change for each land cover, confirming that a new meta-stable state of
   equilibrium between human land use and natural processes of secondary
   succession was being approached.
   A discussion of management strategies for such equilibrium is therefore
   proposed to contribute to the development of effective conservation
   actions for the semi-natural landscapes of Mediterranean Basin. The
   presented approach aims to stimulate the inclusion of stability analysis
   into the planning and management of abandoned landscapes. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{1. Decreases in biodiversity are so widespread that they are now
   considered a form of global change in their own right. Given the grave
   nature of this issue, rapid advances in understanding are needed to
   mitigate further impacts. In this Opinion paper, we argue that
   palaeolimnological studies have important contributions to make to
   biodiversity science.
   2. Given that long-term community data are sparse in their geographic
   coverage and tend to span no more than 5 years, greater insight into
   biodiversity dynamics can be obtained from palaeoecological analyses.
   One such approach is palaeolimnology, which is a field that can provide
   long-term data on changes in both physico-chemical and biological
   components of lake ecosystems.
   3. To date, a handful of quantitative palaeolimnological studies have
   addressed biodiversity questions, focussing primarily on defining the
   drivers of change in species richness or identifying functional traits
   that best capture ecosystem processes. Several studies have also
   quantified the role of spatial variables in determining assemblage
   structure, a necessary first step in addressing how metacommunity
   interactions influence biodiversity-ecosystem processes. Overall, these
   early studies show that palaeolimnological approaches can address both
   similar and novel questions compared with contemporary ecological
   studies. However, palaeolimnology allows for a great expansion of the
   temporal scale of investigation, the quantification of rates of change
   to stressors and the possibility of conducting experiments by applying
   resurrection techniques.
   4. As an emerging field, there are numerous exciting applications of
   palaeolimnology to biodiversity science. It is an opportune time to
   create synergy between contemporary aquatic ecologists and
   palaeolimnologists.}},

Abstract = {{Question: How do clonal traits of a locally dominant grass (Elymus
   repens (L.) Gould.) respond to soil heterogeneity and shape spatial
   patterns of its tillers? How do tiller spatial patterns constrain
   seedling recruitment within the community?
   Locations: Artificial banks of the River Rhone, France.
   Material and Methods: We examined 45 vegetation patches dominated by
   Elymus repens. During a first phase we tested relationships between soil
   variables and three clonal traits (spacer length, number of clumping
   tillers and branching rate), and between the same clonal traits and
   spatial patterns (i.e. density and degree of spatial aggregation) of
   tillers at a very fine scale. During a second phase, we performed a
   sowing experiment to investigate effects of density and spatial patterns
   of E. repens on recruitment of eight species selected from the regional
   species pool.
   Results: Clonal traits had clear effects - especially spacer length - on
   densification and aggregation of E. repens tillers and, at the same
   time, a clear response of these same clonal traits as soil granulometry
   changed. The density and degree of aggregation of E. repens tillers was
   positively correlated to total seedling cover and diversity at the
   finest spatial scales.
   Conclusions: Spatial patterning of a dominant perennial grass responds
   to soil heterogeneity through modifications of its clonal morphology as
   a trade-off between phalanx and guerrilla forms. In turn, spatial
   patterns have strong effects on abundance and diversity of seedlings.
   Spatial patterns of tillers most probably led to formation of endogenous
   gaps in which the recruitment of new plant individuals was enhanced.
   Interestingly, we also observed more idiosyncratic effects of tiller
   spatial patterns on seedling cover and diversity when focusing on
   different growth forms of the sown species.}},

Abstract = {{Question: How frequent and variable were fire disturbances in longleaf
   pine ecosystems? Has the frequency and seasonality of fire events
   changed during the past few centuries?
   Location: Kisatchie National Forest, Western Gulf Coastal Plain,
   longleaf pine-bluestem ecosystem, in relatively rough topography
   adjacent to the Red River, Louisiana, USA.
   Methods: Cross-sections of 19 remnant pines exhibiting 190 fire scars
   were collected from a 1.2-km(2) area. Tree-rings and fire scars were
   precisely dated and analysed for the purpose of characterizing past
   changes in fire and tree growth. Temporal variability in fire occurrence
   and seasonality was described for the pre- and post-European settlement
   periods. Seasonality of historic fires was determined by the scar
   position within the rings. The relationship between fire and drought was
   investigated using correlation and superposed epoch analysis.
   Results: The mean fire return interval for the period 1650-1905 was 2.2
   years (range 0.5 to 12 yr). Significant new findings include: evidence
   for years of biannual burning, temporal variability in fire seasonality,
   an increase in fire frequency and percentage of trees scarred circa
   1790, and synchronous growth suppression and subsequent release of trees
   coinciding with land-use changes near the turn of the 20th century.
   Drought conditions appeared unrelated to the occurrence of fire events
   or fire seasonality.
   Conclusions: Multi-century fire history records from longleaf pine
   ecosystems are difficult to obtain due to historic land-use practices
   and the species high resistance to scarring; however, our results
   indicate potential for reconstructing detailed fire histories in this
   ecosystem. Fire scars quantitatively documented one of the most frequent
   fire regimes known. Fire regime information, such as the temporal
   variability in fire intervals, prevalence of late-growing season fire
   events and biannual burning, provide a new perspective on the dynamics
   of longleaf pine fire regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Large complete species-level molecular phylogenies can provide the most
   direct information about the macroevolutionary history of clades having
   poor fossil records. However, extinction will ultimately erode evidence
   of pulses of rapid speciation in the deep past. Assessment of how well,
   and for how long, phylogenies retain the signature of such pulses has
   hitherto been based on a-probably untenable-model of ongoing
   diversity-independent diversification. Here, we develop two new tests
   for changes in diversification `rules' and evaluate their power to
   detect sudden increases in equilibrium diversity in clades simulated
   with diversity-dependent speciation and extinction rates. Pulses of
   diversification are only detected easily if they occurred recently and
   if the rate of species turnover at equilibrium is low; rates reported
   for fossil mammals suggest that the power to detect a doubling of
   species diversity falls to 50 per cent after less than 50 Myr even with
   a perfect phylogeny of extant species. Extinction does eventually draw a
   veil over past dynamics, suggesting that some questions are beyond the
   limits of inference, but sudden clade-wide pulses of speciation can be
   detected after many millions of years, even when overall diversity is
   constrained. Applying our methods to existing phylogenies of mammals and

   diversity appeared to be lowest in samples collected from the north and
   south of the transect where Prochlorococcus diversity was also lowest.
   The results were correlated to the abundance and diversity of the

   no significant correlations to either of the two potential host genera.

Abstract = {{Populations of both native higher Antarctic plants, Deschampsia
   antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis, increased during the last decades.
   However, for D. antarctica, previous population studies on the South
   Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula have been too sporadic,
   patchy, and methodologically different to allow general conclusions. Our
   aim was to compare sites with D. antarctica along a north-south
   latitudinal transect with an integral census method to assess the
   possible impact of climatic change on grass population dynamics. During
   two summer seasons (2009-2010), plant populations were censed on Fildes
   and Coppermine Peninsula and several localities on the west coast of the
   Antarctic Peninsula. Largest plant populations were found on Fildes
   Peninsula with vegetation cover (VC) of 44-46\%. Six out of eleven
   stands of D. antarctica on Coppermine Peninsula were new records, with
   increasing plant number and VC (0.1-22\%). In the Antarctic Peninsula,
   contrarily to our expectation, only at Forbes Point, D. antarctica VC
   was relatively high (ca. 2\%) and a new stand of C. quitensis was found.
   At three previously reported sites, plants had disappeared. Our
   monitoring confirms that northern D. antarctica populations are
   expanding, but that this expansion is not continuous along the Antarctic
   Peninsula and inconsistent with the gradient of relative temperature
   increase in north-south direction. We suggest that other abiotic and
   biotic factors are influencing the colonization and expansion of
   vascular plants in this particular ecosystem.}},

Title = {{Ecological principles of species distribution models: the habitat
   matching rule}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},

Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{2057-2065}},

Abstract = {{Most species distribution models (SDMs) assume that habitats are closed,
   stable and without competition. In that environmental context, it is
   ecologically correct to assume that members of a species will be
   distributed in direct relation to the suitability of the habitat, that
   is, according to the so-called habitat matching rule. This paper
   examines whether it is possible to maintain the assumption of the
   habitat matching rule in the following circumstances: (1) when habitats
   are connected and organisms can move between them, (2) when there are
   disturbances and seasonal cycles that generate instability, and (3) when
   there is interspecific and intra-specific competition. Here I argue that
   it is possible as long as the following aspects are taken into account.
   In open habitats at equilibrium, in which habitat selection and
   competition operate, the habitat matching rule can be applied in some
   conditions, while competition tends to homogenize the species
   distribution in other environmental contexts. In the latter case, two
   methods can be used to incorporate these effects into SDMs: new
   parameters can be incorporated into the response functions, or the
   occurrence of proportions of categories of individuals (adult/young,
   male/female, or dominant/subordinate species in guilds) can be used
   instead of the occurrence of organisms. The habitat matching rule is not
   fulfilled in non-equilibrium environments. The solution to this problem
   lies in the design of SDMs with two strategies that depend on scale.
   Locally, the disequilibrium can be encapsulated using average
   environmental conditions, with sufficiently large cells (in the case of
   metapopulations) and/or long enough sampling periods (in the case of
   seasonal cycles). At coarse scales, the use of presence-only models can
   in some cases avoid the destabilizing effect of catastrophic historical
   processes. The matching law is a strong assumption of SDMs because it is
   based on population ecology theory and the principle of evolution by
   natural selection.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Parrots are thought to have originated on Gondwana during the
   Cretaceous. The initial split within crown group parrots separated the
   New Zealand taxa from the remaining extant species and was considered to
   coincide with the separation of New Zealand from Gondwana 82-85 Ma,
   assuming that the diversification of parrots was mainly shaped by
   vicariance. However, the distribution patterns of several extant parrot
   groups cannot be explained without invoking transoceanic dispersal,
   challenging this assumption. Here, we present a temporal and spatial
   framework for the diversification of parrots using external avian
   fossils as calibration points in order to evaluate the relative
   importance of the influences of past climate change, plate tectonics and
   ecological opportunity.
   Location Australasian, African, Indo-Malayan and Neotropical regions.
   Methods Phylogenetic relationships were investigated using partial
   sequences of the nuclear genes c-mos, RAG-1 and Zenk of 75 parrot and 21
   other avian taxa. Divergence dates and confidence intervals were
   estimated using a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach.
   Biogeographic patterns were evaluated taking temporal connectivity
   between areas into account. We tested whether diversification remained
   constant over time and if some parrot groups were more species-rich than
   expected given their age.
   Results Crown group diversification of parrots started only about 58 Ma,
   in the Palaeogene, significantly later than previously thought. The
   Australasian lories and possibly also the Neotropical Arini were found
   to be unexpectedly species-rich. Diversification rates probably
   increased around the Eocene/Oligocene boundary and in the middle
   Miocene, during two periods of major global climatic aberrations
   characterized by global cooling.
   Main conclusions The diversification of parrots was shaped by climatic
   and geological events as well as by key innovations. Initial vicariance
   events caused by continental break-up were followed by transoceanic
   dispersal and local radiations. Habitat shifts caused by climate change
   and mountain orogenesis may have acted as a catalyst to the
   diversification by providing new ecological opportunities and challenges
   as well as by causing isolation as a result of habitat fragmentation.
   The lories constitute the only highly nectarivorous parrot clade, and
   their diet shift, associated with morphological innovation, may have
   acted as an evolutionary key innovation, allowing them to explore
   underutilized niches and promoting their diversification.}},

Abstract = {{Process-based ecosystem models are useful tools, not only for

   slow-relation scheme was tested with the CENTURY version 4 ecosystem
   model. Three different combinations of scaled soil pools were also
   tested, and compared to the results from a fast-relaxation regime. The
   fast-relaxation of soil pools produced unstable, transient model
   behaviour whereas slow-relaxation overcame this instability. This

Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{527-533}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. We use population synchrony as a new empirical method to assess
   functional connectivity the permeability of landscapes given species
   dispersal attributes. Functional connectivity is important because
   well-connected metapopulations are expected to be more resistant to
   stochastic events causing extinction.
   2. A variety of factors impact population synchrony, and we attempt to
   account for several of these (shared climate, distance, habitat
   similarity and location within the range) before investigating impacts
   of the suitability of the landscape between populations - a proxy for
   permeability to dispersal.
   3. For the Speckled Wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria), we find that
   population synchrony is positively correlated with landscape
   suitability, suggesting that synchrony might be used to measure
   functional connectivity.
   4. The importance of landscape suitability for population synchrony
   shows a humped relationship with distance -suitability has no effect
   between 0 and 20 km, then showing a significant positive effect above 20
   km but with reduced (still significant) effect from 160 to 200 km. This
   suggests that relatively close populations may exchange sufficient
   migrants for synchronisation, regardless of the matrix suitability. In
   contrast, more separate populations are synchronised only where the
   landscape permits functional connectivity, most likely through dispersal
   between intermediate stepping-stone populations.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We show that patterns of synchrony in
   long-term monitoring data can be used to estimate functional
   connectivity of landscapes. As such, this technique might be used to
   test and prioritise the effectiveness of land management for
   conservation of species and to mitigate the effects of climate change.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The IUCN Red List is the most useful list of species that are at risk
   for extinction worldwide, as it relies on a number of objective
   criteria. Nevertheless, there is a taxonomic bias that excludes species
   with small body sizes, narrow distribution ranges and low dispersal
   abilities, which constitute the vast Majority of the planet's biota,
   particularly local endemics.
   By evaluating each IUCN criterion separately, we (i) identify the
   shortcomings for invertebrate applications, (ii) explain how risk
   categories may be wrongly applied due to inapplicable and/or misleading
   thresholds, (iii) suggest alternative ways of applying the existing
   criteria in a more realistic way and (iv) suggest possible new criteria
   that were not considered in the current evaluation framework but that
   could allow a more comprehensive and effective assessment of
   invertebrates.
   By adapting the criteria to rely more explicitly on the Area of
   Occupancy and the Extent of Occurrence, their respective trends and by
   using ecological modelling methods, the criteria's applicability would
   be increased. The change in some thresholds or, eventually, the creation
   of sub-categories would further increase their adequacy. Additionally,
   co-extinction could be introduced as an explicit part of the
   classification process.
   As a case study, we evaluated 48 species of Azorean arthropods and
   Iberian spiders according to the current criteria. More than one-quarter
   (27\%) of all evaluated species were classified as Critically

Abstract = {{Life-history theory predicts that older females will increase

   survival is density dependent or female size constrains offspring size,
   theory does not predict variation in offspring size. However, empirical

   determine when variable offspring sizes can be explained by an
   interaction between female age, female state and survival costs of
   reproduction. We found that when costs depend on fecundity, young
   females with surplus state increase offspring size and reduce number to
   minimize fitness penalties. When costs depend on total reproductive
   effort, only older females increase offspring size. Young females
   produce small offspring, because decreasing offspring size is less
   expensive than number, as fitness from offspring investment is
   nonlinear. Finally, allocation patterns are relatively stable when older
   females are better at acquiring food and are therefore in better
   condition. Our approach revealed an interaction between female state,

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Rapid climate change, in conjunction with other anthropogenic drivers,
   has the potential to cause mass species extinction. To minimize this
   risk, conservation reserves need to be coordinated at multiple spatial
   scales because the climate envelopes of many species may shift rapidly
   across large geographic areas. In addition, novel species assemblages
   and ecological reorganization make future conditions uncertain. We used
   a GIS analysis to assess the vulnerability of 501 reserve units in the
   National Wildlife Refuge System as a basis for a nationally coordinated
   response to climate change adaptation. We used measures of climate
   change exposure (historic rate of temperature change), sensitivity
   (biome edge and critical habitat for threatened and endangered species),
   and adaptive capacity (elevation range, latitude range, watershed road
   density, and watershed protection) to evaluate refuge vulnerability. The
   vulnerability of individual refuges varied spatially within and among
   biomes. We suggest that the spatial variability in vulnerability be used
   to define suites of management approaches that capitalize on local
   conditions to facilitate adaptation and spread risk across the reserve
   network. We conceptually define four divergent management strategies to
   facilitate adaption: refugia, ecosystem maintenance, ``natural{''}
   adaptation, and facilitated transitions. Furthermore, we recognize that
   adaptation approaches can use historic (i.e., retrospective) and future
   (prospective) condition as temporal reference points to define
   management goals.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Is vegetation composition of ombrotrophic bogs with an
   undisturbed water regime resistant or sensitive to ongoing high
   atmospheric deposition and climatic changes?
   Location: The Sudeten Mountains (Czech Republic).
   Methods: Species composition of bryophytes and vascular plants was
   sampled in 25 permanent plots in suboceanic bogs of the Jizerske hory
   Mountains and in 26 permanent plots in subcontinental bogs of the Hruby
   Jesenik Mountains. The permanent plots were established and first
   sampled in 1991. These plots were re-sampled after 14 and 17 years,
   respectively. We also used historical vegetation plots (1947-1949; 1980)
   from the same localities in order to reveal possible changes that might
   start earlier. Water chemistry was analysed annually, usually three
   times a year. Compositional changes were analysed by PERMANOVA,
   beta-diversity changes by PERMDISP and other changes by t-test and
   Fisher's exact test.
   Results: At the community level, no statistically significant changes
   were detected in permanent plots (PERMANOVA, PERMDISP), either in
   hollows or in hummocks, but the vegetation composition changed between
   the oldest (historical) and the newest data sets. At the level of
   functional groups, cover of Cyperaceae significantly decreased and cover
   of other herbs (excluding graminoids) and Sphagna increased in the Hruby
   Jesenik Mountains, whereas no changes were detected in the Jizerske hory
   Mountains. Cover of ericoid dwarf shrubs has not changed in either area.
   At the level of particular species, the frequency of Sphagnum
   magellanicum, Carex limosa, Scheuchzeria palustris and Vaccinium
   myrtillus decreased, while the frequency of Straminergon stramineum,
   Sphagnum recurvum agg., Eriophorum angustifolium and Luzula sylvatica
   increased. These changes were more evident when recent and historical
   data were compared.
   Conclusions: When water regime is not affected, the bog vegetation seems
   to be rather resistant to high atmospheric deposition and climate
   fluctuation. A significant change of the species composition occurs only
   in the long-term perspective. Particular species could, however,
   decrease or increase their frequencies more rapidly. For some of these
   species a positive or negative response to nitrogen availability was
   also found in other studies, whereas for other species further research
   is needed in order to separate the effects of atmospheric deposition and
   internal ecosystem dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The recent paper by Bartolino et al. (Popul Ecol 53:351-359, 2011)
   presents a new method to objectively select hotspots using cumulative
   relative frequency distribution (CRFD) curves. This method is presented
   as being independent from the selection of any threshold and, therefore,
   less arbitrary than traditional approaches. We argue that this method,
   albeit mathematically sound, is based on likewise arbitrary decisions
   regarding threshold selection. Specifically, the use of the CRFD curve
   approach requires the occurrence of two criteria for the method to be
   applied correctly: the selection of a 45A degrees tangent to the curve,
   and the need to consider the highest relative value of the study
   parameter corresponding to a 45A degrees slope tangent to the curve.
   Using two case studies (dealing with species richness and abundance of a
   particular species), we demonstrate that these two criteria are really
   unrelated to the underlying causes that shape the spatial pattern of the
   phenomena under study, but rather related to sampling design and spatial
   scale; hence, one could likewise use different but valid criteria.
   Consequently, the CRFD curve approach is based on the selection of a
   pre-defined threshold that has little, if any, ecological justification,
   and that heavily influences the final hotspot selection. Therefore, we
   conclude that the CRFD curve approach itself is not necessarily better
   and more objective than any of the global methods typically used for
   hotspot identification. Indeed, mathematical and/or statistical
   approaches should not be viewed as a panacea to solve conservation
   problems, but rather used in combination with biological, practical,
   economic and social considerations.}},

Abstract = {{Mass balanced models yield valuable information regarding ecological
   function and delivery of ecosystem services, but often rely on data
   collected well before many species were reduced to fractions of their
   original abundance. Lagoonal systems, such as Great South Bay (GSB), NY,
   sit on the interface of terrestrial and marine ecosystems and are prone
   to anthropogenic stressors but proximity to land also makes the presence
   of data regarding historic populations and structure more likely. To
   quantify over a century of ecosystem change, Ecopath models were
   developed for GSB at each of four time periods where commercial and
   scientific data exist: 1880s, 1930s, 1980s and 2000s. The results
   indicated that the GSB has experienced a decline in ecosystem maturity,
   loss of top keystone predators, a decline in connectivity to the ocean
   though the reduction of migratory species and increasing dominance of
   low trophic level organisms. These changes undermine the delivery of
   ecosystem services, increase conflicts over limited resources and
   suggest that present day restoration targets fail to recognize
   appropriate baselines. We discuss the role of stochastic events, which
   result in state changes that could be defined as regime shifts, and
   ecosystem connectivity to the long-term stability of lagoonal systems.

Abstract = {{Customary medicinal plant species used by Australian Aborigines are

   they represent sources of novel therapeutic phytochemical compounds and
   arc. culturally valuable. Information on the spatial distribution and
   use of customary medicinal plants is often inadequate and fragmented,
   posing limitations on the identification and conservation of
   species-rich areas and culturally valuable habitats.
   In this study, the habitat suitability modeling program, MaxEnt, was
   used to predict the potential ecological niches of 431 customary
   medicinal plant species, based on bioclimatic variables. Specimen
   locality records were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information
   Facility (GBIF) data portal and from Australia's Virtual Herbarium
   (AVH).
   Ecological niche models of 414 predicted species, which had 30 or more
   occurrence points, were used to produce maps indicating areas that were
   ecologically suitable for multiple species (concordance of high
   predicted ecological suitability) and having cultural values. For the
   concordance map, individual species niche models were thresholded and
   summed. To derive a map of culturally valuable areas, customary
   medicinal uses from Customary Medicinal Knowledgebase (CMKb)
   (www.biolinfo.org/cmkb) were used to weight individual species models,
   resulting in a value within each grid cell reflecting its cultural
   worth.
   Even though the available information is scarce and fragmented, our
   approach provides an opportunity to infer areas predicted to be suitable
   for multiple species (i.e. concordance hotspots) and to estimate the
   cultural value of a particular geographical area. Our results also
   indicate that to conserve bio-cultural diversity, comprehensive
   information and active participation of Aboriginal communities is
   indispensable. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Characterized more by its research purpose than by a common set of

   more traditional disciplinary-based science for sustainability and the
   transdisciplinary science of sustainability. Whereas the former consists
   of more descriptive, analytical and basic science, the latter is

   post-secondary institutions by reviewing institutional course catalogs

   institutions. More than half of the courses were offered within
   departments that focused on natural resource management, and were

   classroom settings during the academic year and were geared toward
   advanced students. Course titles suggested an emphasis on the science of
   restoration ecology over the practice of ecological restoration, and
   learning objectives focused primarily on concepts and less on skills and

   exams. Many courses assigned readings from the primary literature; there

   restoration is being presented to students as an advanced undertaking

Abstract = {{We present an approach to modeling potential climate-driven changes in
   habitat for tree and bird species in the eastern United States. First,
   we took an empirical-statistical modeling approach, using randomForest,
   with species abundance data from national inventories combined with
   soil, climate, and landscape variables, to build abundance-based habitat
   models for 134 tree and 147 bird species. We produced lists of species
   for which suitable habitat tends to increase, decrease, or stay the same
   for any region. Independent assessments of trends of large trees versus
   seedlings across the eastern U.S. show that 37 of 40 species in common
   under both studies are currently trending as modeled. We developed a
   framework, ModFacs, in which we used the literature to assign default
   modification factor scores for species characteristics that cannot be
   readily assessed in such models, including 12 disturbance factors (for
   example, drought, fire, insect pests), nine biological factors (for
   example, dispersal, shade tolerance), and assessment scores of novel
   climates, long-distance extrapolations, and output variability by
   climate model and emission scenario. We also used a spatially explicit
   cellular model, SHIFT, to calculate colonization potentials for some
   species, based on their abundance, historic dispersal distances, and the
   fragmented nature of the landscape. By combining results from the three
   efforts, we can create projections of potential climate change impacts

   have learned over 16 years in hopes that they may help guide future

Abstract = {{Elevated temperatures resulting from climate change pose a clear threat
   to reef-building corals; however, the traits that might influence
   corals' survival and dispersal during climate change remain poorly
   understood. Global gene expression profiling is a powerful
   hypothesis-forming tool that can help elucidate these traits. Here, we
   applied a novel RNA-Seq protocol to study molecular responses to heat
   and settlement inducers in aposymbiotic larvae of the reef-building
   coral Acropora millepora. This analysis of a single full-sibling family
   revealed contrasting responses between short- (4-h) and long-term
   (5-day) exposures to elevated temperatures. Heat shock proteins were
   up-regulated only in the short-term treatment, while the long-term
   treatment induced the down-regulation of ribosomal proteins and
   up-regulation of genes associated with ion transport and metabolism
   (Ca2+ and CO32-). We also profiled responses to settlement cues using a
   natural cue (crustose coralline algae, CCA) and a synthetic neuropeptide
   (GLW-amide). Both cues resulted in metamorphosis, accompanied by
   differential expression of genes with known developmental roles. Some
   genes were regulated only by the natural cue, which may correspond to
   the recruitment-associated behaviour and morphology changes that precede
   metamorphosis under CCA treatment, but are bypassed under GLW-amide
   treatment. Validation of these expression profiles using qPCR confirmed
   the quantitative accuracy of our RNA-Seq approach. Importantly, qPCR
   analysis of different larval families revealed extensive variation in
   these responses depending on genetic background, including qualitative
   differences (i.e. up-regulation in one family and down-regulation in
   another). Future studies of gene expression in corals will have to
   address this genetic variation, which could have important adaptive
   consequences for corals during global climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Aim East Africa is one of the most biologically diverse regions,
   especially in terms of endemism and species richness. Hypotheses put
   forward to explain this high diversity invoke a role for forest refugia
   through: (1) accumulation of new species due to radiation within
   refugial habitats, or (2) retention of older palaeoendemic species in
   stable refugia. We tested these alternative hypotheses using data for a
   diverse genus of East African forest chameleons, Kinyongia.
   Location East Africa.
   Methods We constructed a dated phylogeny for Kinyongia using one nuclear
   and two mitochondrial markers. We identified areas of high phylogenetic
   diversity (PD) and evolutionary diversity (ED), and mapped ancestral
   areas to ascertain whether lineage diversification could best be
   explained by vicariance or dispersal.
   Results Vicariance best explains the present biogeographic patterns,
   with divergence between three major Kinyongia clades (Albertine Rift,
   southern Eastern Arc, northern Eastern Arc) in the early
   Miocene/Oligocene (> 20 Ma). Lineage diversification within these clades
   pre-dates the Pliocene (> 6 Ma). These dates are much older than the
   Plio-Pleistocene climatic shifts associated with cladogenesis in other
   East African taxa (e. g. birds), and instead point to a scenario whereby
   palaeoendemics are retained in refugia, rather than more recent
   radiations within refugia. Estimates of PD show that diversity was
   highest in the Uluguru, Nguru and East Usambara Mountains and several
   lineages (from Mount Kenya, South Pare and the Uluguru Mountains) stand
   out as being evolutionarily distinct as a result of isolation in forest
   refugia. PD was lower than expected by chance, suggesting that the
   phylogenetic signal is influenced by an unusually low number of extant
   lineages with long branch lengths, which is probably due to the
   retention of palaeoendemic lineages.
   Main conclusions The biogeographic patterns associated with Kinyongia
   are the result of long evolutionary histories in isolation. The
   phylogeny is dominated by ancient lineages whose origins date back to
   the early Miocene/Oligocene as a result of continental wide forest
   fragmentation and contraction due to long term climatic changes in
   Africa. The maintenance of palaeoendemic lineages in refugia has
   contributed substantially to the remarkably high biodiversity of East
   Africa.}},

Abstract = {{1. Colonization success of species when confronted with novel
   environments is of interest in ecological, evolutionary and conservation
   contexts. Such events may represent the first step for ecological
   diversification. They also play an important role in adaptive divergence
   and speciation.
   2. A species that is able to do well across a range of environments has
   a higher plasticity than one whose success is restricted to a single or
   few environments. The breadth of environments in which a species can
   succeed is ultimately determined by the full pattern of its vital rates
   in each environment.
   3. Examples of organisms colonizing novel environments are insect
   herbivores expanding their diets to novel host plants. One expectation
   for insect herbivores is that species with specialized diets may display
   less plasticity when faced with novel hosts than generalist species.
   4. We examine this hypothesis for two generalist and two specialist
   neotropical beetles (genus Cephaloleia: Chrysomelidae) currently
   expanding their diets from native to novel plants of the order
   Zingiberales. Using an experimental approach, we estimated changes in
   vital rates, life-history traits and lifetime fitness for each beetle
   species when feeding on native or novel host plants.
   5. We did not find evidence supporting more plasticity for generalists
   than for specialists. Instead, we found similar patterns of survival and
   fecundity for all herbivores. Larvae survived worse on novel hosts;
   adults survived at least as well or better, but reproduced less on the
   novel host than on natives.
   6. Some of the novel host plants represent challenging environments
   where population growth was negative. However, in four novel
   plant-herbivore interactions, instantaneous population growth rates were
   positive.
   7. Positive instantaneous population growth rates during initial
   colonization of novel host plants suggest that both generalist and
   specialist Cephaloleia beetles may be pre-adapted to feed on some novel
   hosts. This plasticity in host use is a key factor for successful
   colonization of novel hosts. Future success or failure in the
   colonization of these novel hosts will depend on the demographic rates
   described in this research, natural selection and the evolutionary
   responses of life-history traits in novel environments.}},

Abstract = {{1. Most studies addressing the causes of the recent increases and
   expansions of mesopredators in many ecosystems have focused on the
   top-down, releasing effect of extinctions of large apex predators.
   However, in the case of the northward expansion of the red fox into the
   arctic tundra, a bottom-up effect of increased resource availability has
   been proposed, an effect that can counteract prey shortage in the low
   phase of the multi-annual rodent cycle. Resource subsidies both with
   marine and with terrestrial origins could potentially be involved.
   2. During different phases of a multi-annual rodent cycle, we
   investigated the seasonal dynamics and spatial pattern of resource use
   by red foxes across a coast to inland low arctic tundra gradient,
   Varanger Peninsula, Norway. We employed two complementary methods of
   diet analyses: stomach contents and stable isotope analysis.
   3. We found that inland red foxes primarily subsisted on reindeer
   carrions during the low phase of a small rodent population cycle.
   Lemmings became the most important food item towards the peak phase of
   the rodent cycle, despite being less abundant than sympatric voles.
   Isotopic signatures of tissue from both predator and prey also revealed
   that red foxes near the coast used marine-derived subsidies in the
   winter, but these allochthonous resources did not spillover to adult
   foxes living beyond 20-25 km from the coast.
   4. Although more needs to be learned about the link between increasing
   primary productivity due to climatic warming and trophic dynamics in
   tundra ecosystems, we suggest that changes in reindeer management
   through a bottom-up effect, at least regionally, may have paved the way
   towards the establishment of a new mesopredator in the tundra biome.}},

Abstract = {{This paper collects, with few minor formal changes, two of the latest
   scientific contributions (Tiezzi, 2006a; Tiezzi et al., 2010) written by
   Prof. Enzo Tiezzi, where he introduced new concepts and tools to
   formalize and understand the role of thermodynamics in ecosystems
   theory.
   Particular attention is devoted to goal functions, to the relation of
   matter, energy, space and time and to the interdisciplinary approach
   connecting thermodynamics and biology. Entropy is discussed as a
   fundamental goal function in the far from equilibrium framework. The
   relationship between entropy, as a non-state function, and the
   state-function energy is stressed and discussed, at the light of the
   role of information. The theory of probability is also discussed in the
   light of new theoretical findings related to the role of events, also in
   terms of entropy and evolutionary thermodynamics.
   Confined Ontic Open Systems (COOS) represent the latest model proposed
   by Prof. Tiezzi based on his Ecodynamic theory, evolutionary
   thermodynamics, Ulanowicz's ontic. The model has a wide range of
   applications, including ecosystems, ecological economics, urban
   organization, the supra-molecular structure of water and global
   biosphere's models. The model is explained in terms of evolutionary
   thermodynamics and Jorgensen's ecosystems theory. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Increasing difficulties associated with balancing consumptive demands
   for water and achieving ecological benefits in aquatic ecosystems
   provide opportunities for new ecosystem-scale ecological response models
   to assist managers. Using an Australian estuary as a case study, we
   developed a novel approach to create a data-derived state-and-transition
   model. The model identifies suites of co-occurring birds, fish, benthic
   invertebrates and aquatic macrophytes (as `states') and the changing
   physico-chemical conditions that are associated with each
   ('transitions'). The approach first used cluster analysis to identify
   sets of co-occurring biota. Differences in the physico-chemical data
   associated with each state were identified using classification trees,
   with the biotic distinctness of the resultant statistical model tested
   using analysis of similarities. The predictive capacity of the model was
   tested using new cases. Two models were created using different
   time-steps (annual and quarterly) and then combined to capture both
   longer-term trends and more-recent declines in ecological condition. We
   identified eight ecosystem states that were differentiated by a mix of
   water-quantity and water-quality variables. Each ecosystem state
   represented a distinct biotic assemblage under well-defined
   physico-chemical conditions. Two `basins of attraction' were identified,
   with four tidally-influenced states, and another four independent of
   tidal influence. Within each basin, states described a continuum of
   relative health, manifest through declining taxonomic diversity and
   abundances. The main threshold determining relative health was whether
   freshwater flows had occurred in the region during the previous 339
   days. Canonical analyses of principal coordinates tested the predictive
   capacity of the model and demonstrated that the variance in the
   environmental data set was well captured (87\%) with 52\% of the
   variance in the biological data set also captured. The latter increased
   to >80\% when long- and short-term biological data were analysed
   separately, indicating that the model described the available data for
   the Coorong well. This approach thus created a data-derived,
   multivariate model, where neither states nor transitions were determined
   a priori. The approach did not over-fit the data, was robust to patchy
   or missing data, the choice of initial clustering technique and random
   errors in the biological data set, and was well-received by local
   natural resource managers. However, the model did not capture causal
   relationships and requires additional testing, particularly during
   future episodes of ecological recovery. The approach shows significant
   promise for simplifying management definitions of ecological condition
   and, via scenario analyses, can be used to assist in manager
   decision-making of large, complex aquatic ecosystems in the future. (C)

Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring is needed to identify changes in disease occurrence and to
   measure the impact of intervention. Using mycobacterial diseases as an
   example, we discuss herein the pros and cons of the current Spanish
   Wildlife Disease Surveillance Scheme providing suggestions for
   monitoring relevant diseases shared with wildlife in other regions
   facing similar challenges. Six points should be considered. This
   includes: (1) making sure the disease is properly monitored in the
   relevant domestic animals or even in humans; (2) also making sure that
   background information on wildlife population ecology is available to
   maximize the benefits of the monitoring effort; (3) selecting the
   appropriate wildlife hosts for monitoring, while being flexible enough
   to incorporate new ones if research suggests their participation; (4)
   selecting the appropriate methods for diagnosis and for time and space
   trend analysis; (5) deciding which parameters to target for monitoring;
   and finally (6) establishing a reasonable sampling effort and a suitable
   sampling stratification to ensure detecting changes over time and
   changes in response to management actions. Wildlife disease monitoring
   produces knowledge that benefits at least three different agencies,
   namely, animal health, public health and conservation, and these should
   combine efforts and resources. Setting up stable, comprehensive and
   accurate schemes at different spatial scales should become a priority.
   Resources are always a limiting factor, but experience shows that
   combined, cross-collaborative efforts allow establishing acceptable
   schemes with a low enough cost to be sustainable over time. These six
   steps for monitoring relevant shared diseases can be adapted to many
   other geographical settings and different disease situations.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding plant community change over time is essential for managing
   important ecosystems such as riparian areas. This study analyzed
   historic vegetation using soil seed banks and the effects of riparian
   shrub removal treatments and channel incision on ecosystem and plant
   community dynamics in Canyon de Chelly National Monument, Arizona. We
   focused on how seeds, nutrients, and ground water influence the
   floristic composition of post-treatment vegetation and addressed three
   questions: (1) How does pre-treatment soil seed bank composition reflect
   post-treatment vegetation composition? (2) How does shrub removal affect
   post-treatment riparian vegetation composition, seed rain inputs, and
   ground water dynamics? and (3) Is available soil nitrogen increased near
   dead Russian olive plants following removal and does this influence
   post-treatment vegetation? We analyzed seed bank composition across the
   study area, analyzed differences in vegetation, ground water levels, and
   seed rain between control, cut-stump and whole-plant removal areas, and
   compared soil nitrogen and vegetation near removed Russian olive to
   areas lacking Russian olive. The soil seed bank contained more riparian
   plants, more native and fewer exotic plants than the extant vegetation.
   Both shrub removal methods decreased exotic plant cover, decreased
   tamarisk and Russian olive seed inputs, and increased native plant cover
   after 2 years. Neither method increased ground water levels. Soil near
   dead Russian olive trees indicated a short-term increase in soil
   nitrogen following plant removal but did not influence vegetation
   composition compared to areas without Russian olive. Following tamarisk
   and Russian olive removal, our study sites were colonized by upland
   plant species. Many western North American rivers have tamarisk and
   Russian olive on floodplains abandoned by channel incision, river
   regulation or both. Our results are widely applicable to sites where
   drying has occurred and vegetation establishment following shrub removal
   is likely to be by upland species.}},

Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Aim We performed the first test of predictions from the abundant-centre
   model using north-west Atlantic coastal organisms. We tested the
   hypotheses that the density of intertidal mussels (Mytilus edulis and M.
   trossulus) and dogwhelks (Nucella lapillus) and mussel age and size
   would peak at an intermediate location along their distribution range.
   We also assessed the latitudinal variation in critical aerial exposure
   time.
   Location North-west Atlantic coast between Newfoundland (Canada) and New
   York (USA), covering 1800 km of shoreline.
   Methods Using a nested design, we measured mussel density, age and size
   and dogwhelk density in 60 wave-exposed rocky intertidal sites spread
   evenly in six regions. Critical aerial exposure times were determined
   using online data.
   Results Mytilus edulis peaked in abundance in Maine and was much less
   abundant in the other regions. Mytilus trossulus peaked in abundance in
   southern Nova Scotia and Maine, was less abundant in the other regions
   to the north, and was absent in the southernmost region (New York). Both
   mussel species were least abundant in a northern region (Cape Breton),
   although not in the northernmost region (Newfoundland). Critical aerial
   exposure times were negatively correlated with overall mussel density.
   Mussel age and size were similar among regions. Dogwhelks peaked in
   abundance in Maine and were much less abundant in the other regions,
   being positively correlated with overall mussel density across regions.
   Main conclusions Density data for M. edulis and N. lapillus provide
   limited support for an abundant-centre pattern, while M. trossulus shows
   a clear rampedsouth distribution. Critical aerial exposure times suggest
   that physiological stress during summer and winter low tides may be
   lowest in Maine and southern Nova Scotia, which might partially explain
   mussel predominance in those regions. Winter ice scour in Cape Breton
   may explain the abundance trough observed there. Mussel size and age may
   be more limited by wave exposure at our sites (as they all face open
   waters) than by regional differences in environmental stress. Dogwhelks,
   which prey on mussels, seem to respond positively to prey density at the
   regional scale. Our study supports the notion that, while the
   abundant-centre model is a useful starting point for research, it often
   represents an oversimplification of reality.}},

Abstract = {{Question: How many vegetation plot observations (releves) are available
   in electronic databases, how are they geographically distributed, what
   are their properties and how might they be discovered and located for
   research and application?
   Location: Global.
   Methods: We compiled the Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases
   (GIVD; http://www.givd.info), an Internet resource aimed at registering
   metadata on existing vegetation databases. For inclusion, databases need
   to (i) contain temporally and spatially explicit species co-occurrence
   data and (ii) be accessible to the scientific public. This paper
   summarizes structure and data quality of databases registered in GIVD as
   of 30 December 2010.
   Results: On the given date, 132 databases containing more than 2.4
   million non-overlapping plots had been registered in GIVD. The majority
   of these data were in European databases (83 databases, 1.6 million
   plots), whereas other continents were represented by substantially less
   (North America 15, Asia 13, Africa nine, South America seven,
   Australasia two, multi-continental three). The oldest plot observation
   was 1864, but most plots were recorded after 1970. Most plots reported
   vegetation on areas of 1 to 1000 m(2); some also stored time-series and
   nested-plot data. Apart from geographic reference (required for
   inclusion), most frequent information was on altitude (71\%), slope
   aspect and inclination (58\%) and land use (38\%), but rarely soil
   properties (<7\%).
   Conclusions: The vegetation plot data in GIVD constitute a major
   resource for biodiversity research, both through the large number of
   species occurrence records and storage of species co-occurrence
   information at a small scale, combined with structural and plot-based
   environmental data. We identify shortcomings in available data that need
   to be addressed through sampling under-represented geographic regions,
   providing better incentives for data collection and sharing, developing
   user-friendly database exchange standards, as well as tools to analyse
   and remove confounding effects of sampling biases. The increased
   availability of data sets conferred by registration in GIVD offers
   significant opportunities for large-scale studies in community ecology,
   macroecology and global change research.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{598-609}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Question: Collaborative research efforts and synthetic vegetation
   analyses are often limited by difficulties in sharing or combining
   datasets. Can we facilitate these activities by means of an exchange
   standard for plot-based vegetation data?
   Methods: In 2003, the Ecoinformatics Working Group and the Council of
   the International Association for Vegetation Science endorsed the
   development of a standard exchange schema for vegetation-plot data. In
   2007, a first workshop was held to formulate a common set of goals,
   concepts, and terminology for plot-based vegetation data. At a second
   workshop in 2008, this ontology was developed into an XML (extensible
   markup language) schema representation designed to be maximally
   compatible with existing standards and databases.
   Results: The exchange standard for plot-based vegetation data (Veg-X)
   allows for observations of vegetation at both individual plant and
   aggregated observation levels. It ensures that observations are fixed to
   physical sample plots at specific points in space and time, and makes a
   distinction between the entity of interest (e. g. an individual tree)
   and the observational act (i.e. a measurement). The standard supports
   repeated measurements of both individual organisms and plots, allows
   observations of entities to be grouped following predefined or
   user-defined criteria, and ensures that the connection between the
   entity observed and taxonomic concept associated with that observation
   are maintained.
   Conclusions: Establishment of exchange standards followed by development
   of ecoinformatics tools built around those standards should allow
   scientists to efficiently combine plot data over extensive spatial and
   temporal gradients in order to perform analyses and make predictions of
   vegetation change and dynamics at local and global scales.}},

   Methods: A potential vegetation map (National Atlas of Mexico) at a 1: 4
   000 000 scale, was downscaled to a 1 km(2) grid resolution using
   climatically based random forests models. The resulting map was then
   evaluated against 256 inventory plots sampled at the transition between
   different vegetation types in Southern Mexico.
   Results: Downscaling increased accuracy up to 0.40, as measured by the
   Kappa Index of Agreement. Multivariate analysis of the results allowed
   the association between Rzedowski's classification and climatic
   variation to be explored. This confirmed that many of the structural
   aspects of the vegetation that are used by the Rzedowski classification
   are closely associated with climate, but it also revealed weaknesses in
   the underlying basis of this classification system.
   Conclusions: Rzedowski's scheme for vegetation classification may
   require further modification in order to be an effective tool for
   research into vegetation-climate relationships.}},

Abstract = {{1. Dynamic occupancy models are often used to investigate questions
   regarding the processes that influence patch occupancy and are prominent
   in the fields of population and community ecology and conservation
   biology. Recently, multistate occupancy models have been developed to
   investigate dynamic systems involving more than one occupied state,
   including reproductive states, relative abundance states and joint
   habitat-occupancy states. Here we investigate the sensitivities of the
   equilibrium-state distribution of multistate occupancy models to changes
   in transition rates.
   2. We develop equilibrium occupancy expressions and their associated
   sensitivity metrics for dynamic multistate occupancy models. To
   illustrate our approach, we use two examples that represent common
   multistate occupancy systems. The first example involves a three-state
   dynamic model involving occupied states with and without successful
   reproduction (California spotted owl Strix occidentalis occidentalis),
   and the second involves a novel way of using a multistate occupancy
   approach to accommodate second-order Markov processes (wood frog
   Lithobates sylvatica breeding and metamorphosis).
   3. In many ways, multistate sensitivity metrics behave in similar ways
   as standard occupancy sensitivities. When equilibrium occupancy rates
   are low, sensitivity to parameters related to colonisation is high,
   while sensitivity to persistence parameters is greater when equilibrium
   occupancy rates are high. Sensitivities can also provide guidance for
   managers when estimates of transition probabilities are not available.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Multistate models provide practitioners a
   flexible framework to define multiple, distinct occupied states and the
   ability to choose which state, or combination of states, is most
   relevant to questions and decisions about their own systems. In addition
   to standard multistate occupancy models, we provide an example of how a
   second-order Markov process can be modified to fit a multistate
   framework. Assuming the system is near equilibrium, our sensitivity
   analyses illustrate how to investigate the sensitivity of the
   system-specific equilibrium state(s) to changes in transition rates.
   Because management will typically act on these transition rates,
   sensitivity analyses can provide valuable information about the
   potential influence of different actions and when it may be prudent to
   shift the focus of management among the various transition rates.}},

Abstract = {{The quantitative expression and monitoring of patch shape deformation is
   an important content of landscape ecology. In this paper, a new
   multi-vector method is put forward based on curve representation in
   differential geometry, which is the composition of Centroid Displacement
   Vector (CDV), Local Deformation Vector (LDV) and the unit normal vector
   on the patch boundary. These composition vectors (CVs) not only add a
   new direction dimension to the landscape pattern metrics already
   available, but also provide multi-scale information, i.e. CV at every
   point and the boundary segment CV (BSCV). This new information can
   provide a quantification basis for a deeper understanding of the
   mechanisms of shape deformation and dynamic analysis. An application of
   CVs to patch dynamics in the Yancheng National Nature Reserve (YNNR) in
   China is given to validate the methodology. The susceptibility to
   invasion of the Common Seepweed in the core area of YNNR is evaluated
   quantitatively by CVs method. Our results indicate that the rate of
   invasion of Smooth Cord-grass into Common Seepweed patch has increased
   by 1.5 times from 1995 to 2002. This is considered to be the dominant
   factor causing Common Seepweed patches to shrink and change dynamically.
   These results help us better understand the landscape patch shape
   deformation and analyze the driver forces of landscape change, and they

Abstract = {{Abundance estimates for black bears (Ursus americanus) are important for
   effective management. Recently, DNA technology has resulted in
   widespread use of noninvasive, genetic capture-mark-recapture (CMR)
   approaches to estimate populations. Few studies have compared the
   genetic CMR methods to other estimation methods. We used genetic CMR to
   estimate the bear population at 2 study sites in northern New Hampshire
   (Pittsburg and Milan) in 2 consecutive years. We compared these
   estimates to those derived from traditional methods used by the New
   Hampshire Fish and Game Department (NHFG) using hunter harvest and
   mortality data. Density estimates produced with genetic CMR methods were
   similar both years and were comparable to those derived from traditional
   methods. In 2006, the estimated number of bears in Pittsburg was 79
   (95\% CI = 60-98) corresponding to a density of 15-24 (95\% CI)
   bears/100 km(2); the 2007 estimate was 83 (95\% CI = 67-99; density =
   16-24 bears/100 km(2)). In 2006, the estimated number of bears in Milan
   was 95 (95\% CI = 74-117; density = 16-25 bears/100 km(2)); the 2007
   estimate was 96 (95\% CI = 77-114; density = 17-25 bears/100 km(2)). We
   found that genetic CMR methods were able to identify demographic
   variation at a local scale, including a strongly skewed sex ratio (2 M:
   1 F) in the Milan population. Genetic CMR is a useful tool for wildlife
   managers to monitor populations of local concern, where abundance or
   demographic characteristics may deviate from regional estimates. Future
   monitoring of the Milan population with genetic CMR is recommended to
   determine if the sex ratio bias continues, possibly warranting a change
   in local harvest regimes. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Novel physical and chemical conditions of many modern ecosystems
   increasingly diverge from the environments known to have existed at any
   time in the history of Earth. The loss of natural land to urbanization
   is one of the most prevalent drivers of novel environments in
   freshwaters. However, current understanding of aquatic community
   response to urbanization is based heavily upon aggregate indicators of
   community structure and linear or wedge-shaped community response models
   that challenge ecological community theory. We applied a new analytical
   method, threshold indicator taxa analysis (TITAN), to a stream
   biomonitoring data set from Maryland to explicitly evaluate linear
   community response models to urbanization that implicitly assume
   individual taxa decline or increase at incrementally different levels of
   urbanization. We used TITAN (1) to identify the location and magnitude
   of greatest change in the frequency and abundance of individual taxa and
   (2) to assess synchrony in the location of change points as evidence for
   stream community thresholds in response to percent impervious cover in
   catchments. We documented clear and synchronous threshold declines of
   110 of 238 macroinvertebrate taxa in response to low levels of
   impervious cover. Approximately 80\% of the declining taxa did so
   between; similar to 0.5\% and 2\% impervious cover, whereas the last
   20\% declined sporadically from; similar to 2\% to 25\% impervious
   cover. Synchrony of individual responses resulted in distinct
   community-level thresholds ranging from <= 0.68\% (mountains), 1.28\%
   (piedmont), and 0.96\% (coastal plain) impervious cover. Upper limits
   (95\% confidence intervals) of community thresholds were <2\% cover in
   all regions. Within distinct physiographic classes, higher-gradient,
   smaller catchments required less impervious cover than lower gradient,
   larger catchments to elicit community thresholds. Relatively few taxa
   showed positive responses to increasing impervious cover, and those that
   did gradually increased in frequency and abundance, approximating a
   linear cumulative distribution. The sharp, synchronous declines of
   numerous taxa established a consistent threshold response at
   exceptionally low levels of catchment urbanization, and uncertainty
   regarding the estimation of impervious cover from satellite data was
   mitigated by several corroborating lines of evidence. We suggest that
   threshold responses of communities to urban and other novel
   environmental gradients may be more prevalent than currently recognized.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 30 years, warm thermal disturbances have become
   commonplace on coral reefs worldwide. These periods of anomalous sea
   surface temperature (SST) can lead to coral bleaching, a breakdown of
   the symbiosis between the host coral and symbiotic dinoflagellates which
   reside in coral tissue. The onset of bleaching is typically predicted to
   occur when the SST exceeds a local climatological maximum by 1 degrees C
   for a month or more. However, recent evidence suggests that the
   threshold at which bleaching occurs may depend on thermal history.
   This study uses global SST data sets (HadISST and NOAA AVHRR) and mass
   coral bleaching reports (from Reefbase) to examine the effect of
   historical SST variability on the accuracy of bleaching prediction. Two
   variability-based bleaching prediction methods are developed from global
   analysis of seasonal and interannual SST variability. The first method
   employs a local bleaching threshold derived from the historical
   variability in maximum annual SST to account for spatial variability in
   past thermal disturbance frequency. The second method uses a different
   formula to estimate the local climatological maximum to account for the
   low seasonality of SST in the tropics. The new prediction methods are
   tested against the common globally fixed threshold method using the
   observed bleaching reports.
   The results find that estimating the bleaching threshold from local
   historical SST variability delivers the highest predictive power, but
   also a higher rate of Type I errors. The second method has the lowest
   predictive power globally, though regional analysis suggests that it may
   be applicable in equatorial regions. The historical data analysis
   suggests that the bleaching threshold may have appeared to be constant
   globally because the magnitude of interannual variability in maximum SST
   is similar for many of the world's coral reef ecosystems. For example,
   the results show that a SST anomaly of 1 degrees C is equivalent to
   1.73-2.94 standard deviations of the maximum monthly SST for two-thirds
   of the world's coral reefs. Coral reefs in the few regions that
   experience anomalously high interannual SST variability like the
   equatorial Pacific could prove critical to understanding how coral
   communities acclimate or adapt to frequent and/or severe thermal
   disturbances.}},

Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1063-1070}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Plant-plant interactions are known to vary with changing
   environmental conditions; however, we have little empirical knowledge of
   the impact of abrupt environmental changes on millennial scale plant
   plant interaction outcomes for long-lived plant species. Here, we used
   palaeoecological data (13-7.6 k years BP) and a novel statistical
   modelling approach to determine the impact of multiple environmental
   drivers on predicted tree grass population interaction outcomes from our
   study site in eastern England.
   2. Changes from high to low herbivore density shortly preceded changes
   to low fire levels and a shift to warmer summers. These transitions
   occurred during a period of increasing nitrogen (N) availability.
   Shortly thereafter, there was a shift in landscape dominance from
   grasses to oaks and then a change to decreasing N availability.
   3. Model predictions of tree grass interaction outcomes varied over time
   with respect to all environmental changes. During the time of high
   disturbances and cool summers, grasses were predicted to out-compete
   oaks. After climate warming and the loss of regular disturbances, the
   predicted outcome was stable coexistence. However, changes in the N
   cycle corresponded with different predicted outcomes: unstable
   competition under increasing N availability and facilitation of oaks by
   grasses when N availability was declining.
   4. Akaike Information Criterion weights indicate that climate warming
   and fewer fires were consistent with the best-fitting model of oak-grass
   interactions for the entire time series (i.e. competitive exclusion to
   stable coexistence). However, reconciling the conflicting model
   predictions with the observed population dynamics suggests that a
   temporary period of unstable competition preceded the predicted shift to
   stable coexistence. This dynamic behaviour is consistent with known
   patterns of shifts between alternative stable states.
   5. Synthesis. We show that abrupt changes in environmental conditions
   over time lead to similarly abrupt changes in tree grass interaction
   outcomes, which were shown to vary in contrasting directions with
   respect to resource versus non-resource variables. The approach
   described here allows plant ecologists to test hypotheses of plant plant
   interactions over successional time scales for long-lived species and
   thus can lead to new knowledge about the structural role of these
   interactions in community dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Given that ecological effects of disturbance have been extensively
   studied in many ecosystems, it is surprising that few quantitative
   syntheses across diverse ecosystems have been conducted. Multi-system
   studies tend to be qualitative because they focus on disturbance types
   that are difficult to measure in an ecologically relevant way. In
   addition, synthesis of existing studies across systems or disturbance
   types is challenging because sufficient information needed for analysis
   is not easily available. Theoretical advances and improved predictions
   can be advanced by generalizations obtained from synthesis activities
   that include multiple sites, ecosystems, and disturbance events.
   Building on existing research, we present a conceptual framework and an
   operational analog to integrate this rich body of knowledge and to
   promote quantitative comparisons of disturbance effects across different
   types of ecosystems and disturbances. This framework recognizes
   individual disturbance events that consist of three quantifiable
   components: (1) environmental drivers, (2) initial system properties,
   and (3) physical and biological mechanisms of effect, such as
   deposition, compaction, and combustion. These components result in
   biotic and abiotic legacies that can interact with subsequent drivers
   and successional processes to influence system response. Through time, a
   coarse-scale quasi-equilibrial state can be reached where variation in
   drivers interacting with biotic processes and feedbacks internal to the
   system results in variability in dynamics. At any time, a driver of
   sufficient magnitude can push the system beyond its realm of natural
   variability to initiate a new kind of event. We use long-term data from
   diverse terrestrial ecosystems to illustrate how our approach can
   facilitate cross-system comparisons, and provide new insights to the
   role of disturbance in ecological systems. We also provide key
   disturbance characteristics and measurements needed to promote future
   quantitative comparisons across ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of threshold can potentially be applied to conservation
   planning of species, habitats, and ecosystems. It also has significance
   in managing social-ecological systems for resilience. However, our
   understanding and use of threshold has been scattered among various
   disciplines, and the link to conservation planning and social-ecological
   system management has not been strongly established. The review of the
   use of threshold in various disciplines reveals that the term is used in
   a similar manner in both natural and social sciences: a threshold is a
   point or a zone on an independent variable, and if it is crossed, a
   sudden, large change in the state of a dependent variable occurs. Even a
   small change in the independent variable brings this drastic change;
   nonlinear relationship characterizes the threshold response. Thresholds
   also separate alternative regimes in a social-ecological system. The
   discussion of the application of threshold concept to watershed planning
   concludes that although using one threshold value of impervious surfaces
   in a watershed to regulate new developments and retrofit old ones is a
   cost-effective method, a more integrated approach is needed. The use of
   habitat amount threshold to conserve species promotes proactive planning
   that would prioritize areas for protection before the threshold is
   reached and would restore habitat based on the threshold target.
   However, species-specific data to decide on the threshold is often
   lacking, and the identification of thresholds is not straightforward.
   Nonetheless, the concept of threshold is appealing for proactive

Abstract = {{In studies of vegetation dynamics, data points describing the changes

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{582-596}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   Treelines occur globally within a narrow range of mean growing season
   temperatures, suggesting that low-temperature growth limitation
   determines the position of the treeline. However, treelines also exhibit
   features that indicate that other mechanisms, such as biomass loss not
   resulting in mortality (dieback) and mortality, determine treeline
   position and dynamics. Debate regarding the mechanisms controlling
   treeline position and dynamics may be resolved by identifying the
   mechanisms controlling prominent treeline spatial patterns (or `form')
   such as the spatial structure of the transition from closed forest to
   the tree limit. Recent treeline studies world-wide have confirmed a
   close link between form and dynamics.
   Location
   The concepts presented refer to alpine treelines globally.
   Methods
   In this review, we describe how varying dominance of three general
   `first-level' mechanisms (tree performance: growth limitation, seedling
   mortality and dieback) result in different treeline forms, what
   `second-level' mechanisms (stresses, e.g. freezing damage,
   photoinhibition) may underlie these general mechanisms, and how they are
   modulated by interactions with neighbours ('third-level' mechanisms).
   This hierarchy of mechanisms should facilitate discussions about
   treeline formation and dynamics.
   Results
   We distinguish four primary treeline forms: diffuse, abrupt, island and
   krummholz. Growth limitation is dominant only at the diffuse treeline,
   which is the form that has most frequently responded as expected to
   growing-season warming, whereas the other forms are controlled by
   dieback and seedling mortality and are relatively unresponsive.
   Main conclusions
   Treeline form provides a means for explaining the current variability in
   treeline position and dynamics and for exploring the general mechanisms
   controlling the responses of treelines to climatic change. Form
   indicates the relative dependence of tree performance on various aspects
   of the external climate (especially summer warmth versus winter
   stressors) and on internal feedbacks, thus allowing inferences on the
   type as well as strength of climate-change responses.}},

   habitat. The method permits a robust statistical classification of
   habitat specialists and generalists, without excluding rare species a
   priori. Based on a user-defined specialization threshold, the model
   classifies species into one of four groups: (1) generalist; (2) habitat
   A specialist; (3) habitat B specialist; and (4) too rare to classify
   with confidence. We illustrate our multinomial classification method
   using two contrasting data sets: (1) bird abundance in woodland and
   heath habitats in southeastern Australia and (2) tree abundance in
   secondgrowth (SG) and old-growth (OG) rain forests in the Caribbean
   lowlands of northeastern Costa Rica. We evaluate the multinomial model
   in detail for the tree data set. Our results for birds were highly
   concordant with a previous nonstatistical classification, but our method
   classified a higher fraction (57.7\%) of bird species with statistical
   confidence. Based on a conservative specialization threshold and
   adjustment for multiple comparisons, 64.4\% of tree species in the full
   sample were too rare to classify with confidence. Among the species
   classified, OG specialists constituted the largest class (40.6\%),
   followed by generalist tree species (36.7\%) and SG specialists
   (22.7\%). The multinomial model was more sensitive than indicator value
   analysis or abundance-based phi coefficient indices in detecting habitat
   specialists and also detects generalists statistically. Classification
   of specialists and generalists based on rarefied subsamples was highly
   consistent with classification based on the full sample, even for
   sampling percentages as low as 20\%. Major advantages of the new method
   are (1) its ability to distinguish habitat generalists (species with no
   significant habitat affinity) from species that are simply too rare to
   classify and (2) applicability to a single representative sample or a
   single pooled set of representative samples from each of two habitat
   types. The method as currently developed can be applied to no more than
   two habitats at a time.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental problems are often complex and it is widely recognized
   that they cannot be satisfactorily addressed by single disciplines. The
   review of forest cover change studies points to the need to carry out
   research integrating economic, political, social and environmental
   aspects. Existing interdisciplinary study areas, namely ecological
   economics, political ecology, sustainability science and Earth system
   governance do not yet fully integrate all the required aspects. This
   paper points out that the establishment of greater synergies between
   those study areas would be beneficial in developing the broader study
   area of environmental governance. A definition of environmental
   governance as a subject of study is developed. Lack of an all
   encompassing theory of environmental governance is highlighted, while
   the improbability of such a theory is acknowledged. In relation to
   normative work, the refinement of principles of good environmental
   governance could support the design and prioritization of policies.
   Empirical research needs to include the testing of hypotheses arising
   from theoretical developments, assessment of policy uptake and new
   exploratory research. Methodologically, environmental governance might
   start from an interdisciplinary approach followed by further integration
   leading to a transdisciplinary study area that uses a mixed methods

Abstract = {{P>1. To predict how plant populations may respond to changes in the
   environment or management, it is necessary to quantify the factors
   influencing their population dynamics and distributions over large
   spatial and/or temporal scales.
   2. Most studies of plant population dynamics monitor demography at the
   sub-metre scale. Extrapolation or prediction from these studies is
   difficult because the data are sparse, parameter error cannot be
   ascertained and the data may not cover the range of expected
   environmental conditions.
   3. Here, we describe a survey method based on density-structured models.
   These models use a discrete density state variable and model rates of
   transition between density states. Although analytically simple, these
   models are empirically useful as they may be parameterized using readily
   collected data. They also offer an empirical link between meso-scale and
   macro-scale population dynamics.
   4. For a large-scale study on annual weeds, we describe the rapid
   estimation of densities using relatively coarse density estimates using
   visual estimates of density. Using information from detailed surveys, we
   describe how we use the method to measure populations of annual plants
   to a scale of 20 x 20 m in areas of up to 4 ha per population within 500
   different arable fields over 3 years.
   5. We show that the approach taken is repeatable within and among
   observers, and we quantify the degree of measurement error. We give
   examples of the resultant data, and compare these with the data obtained
   from nested small-scale plots. Finally, we show how the information from
   this type of survey can be incorporated into population models and used
   to measure within-population and inter-annual flux.}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of animal colors is important to a variety of fields of
   research, especially those dealing with visual communication and sexual
   selection. Most animal colors are easily measured using well-established
   spectrophotometric techniques. However, the unique characteristics of
   iridescent colors present particular challenges and opportunities to
   quantify novel color metrics. Due to the fine-scale angle dependence of
   iridescent coloration, color metrics, such as hue and brightness, must
   be measured using methods that allow for repeatable comparison across
   individuals (e.g., by carefully controlling and measuring viewing
   geometry). Here, we explain how the optical characteristics of
   iridescent colors should be considered when developing measurement
   techniques, describe the pitfalls of some commonly used techniques, and
   recommend improved methods and metrics (angular degree of color change
   and breadth of reflectance) for quantifying iridescent color. In
   particular, most studies of iridescent birds to date have used less than
   ideal procedures and have not provided repeatability estimates for their
   methods. For example, we demonstrate here that measuring coloration from
   overlapping patches of iridescent feathers may be problematic, and we
   argue against methods that do not carefully control viewing geometry. We
   recommend measuring iridescence at maximal reflectance angles using an
   apparatus that allows for sample rotation, and we compare this technique
   to some other commonly used methods using iridescent gorget and crown
   feathers from Anna's hummingbirds (Calypte anna). Our apparatus allows
   for the quantification of angular color change, and we found that
   maximal reflectance measurements using single feathers are highly
   repeatable both within feather samples and among samples within an
   individual.}},

Title = {{Multifunctional shade-tree management in tropical agroforestry
   landscapes - a review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{619-629}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Agricultural intensification reduces ecological resilience of
   land-use systems, whereas paradoxically, environmental change and
   climate extremes require a higher response capacity than ever.
   Adaptation strategies to environmental change include maintenance of
   shade trees in tropical agroforestry, but conversion of shaded to
   unshaded systems is common practice to increase short-term yield.
   2. In this paper, we review the short-term and long-term ecological
   benefits of shade trees in coffee Coffea arabica, C. canephora and cacao
   Theobroma cacao agroforestry and emphasize the poorly understood,
   multifunctional role of shade trees for farmers and conservation alike.
   3. Both coffee and cacao are tropical understorey plants. Shade trees in
   agroforestry enhance functional biodiversity, carbon sequestration, soil
   fertility, drought resistance as well as weed and biological pest
   control. However, shade is needed for young cacao trees only and is less
   important in older cacao plantations. This changing response to shade
   regime with cacao plantation age often results in a transient role for
   shade and associated biodiversity in agroforestry.
   4. Abandonment of old, unshaded cacao in favour of planting young cacao
   in new, thinned forest sites can be named `short-term cacao
   boom-and-bust cycle', which counteracts tropical forest conservation. In
   a `long-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', cacao boom can be followed by
   cacao bust due to unmanageable pest and pathogen levels (e.g. in Brazil
   and Malaysia). Higher pest densities can result from physiological
   stress in unshaded cacao and from the larger cacao area planted.
   Risk-averse farmers avoid long-term vulnerability of their agroforestry
   systems by keeping shade as an insurance against insect pest outbreaks,
   whereas yield-maximizing farmers reduce shade and aim at short-term
   monetary benefits.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable agroforestry management needs
   to conserve or create a diverse layer of multi-purpose shade trees that
   can be pruned rather than removed when crops mature. Incentives from
   payment-for-ecosystem services and certification schemes encourage
   farmers to keep high to medium shade tree cover. Reducing pesticide
   spraying protects functional agrobiodiversity such as antagonists of
   pests and diseases, pollinating midges determining cacao yields and
   pollinating bees enhancing coffee yield. In a landscape perspective,
   natural forest alongside agroforestry allows noncrop-crop spillover of a
   diversity of functionally important organisms. Knowledge transfer
   between farmers, agronomists and ecologists in a participatory approach
   helps to encourage a shade management regime that balances economic and
   ecological needs and provides a `diversified food-and-cash crop'
   livelihood strategy.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Urbanization represents a major threat to biodiversity world-wide
   because it causes permanent degradation and fragmentation of
   biologically rich natural communities. This is particularly acute in
   coastal plains and river valleys, where cities are typically located.
   Although movement is essential to the persistence of populations in
   fragmented landscapes, little is known about how development and
   transportation corridors affect the movements of wildlife in the urban
   context.
   2. We conducted a series of translocation experiments within the urban
   landscape of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to assess the permeability of
   selected landscape elements for two species of forest songbirds with
   contrasting adaptabilities to urban development and migratory
   behaviours: the black-capped chickadee Poecile atricapillus, an
   urban-adaptable year-round resident, and the yellow warbler Dendroica
   petechia, an urban-sensitive Neotropical migrant.
   3. Birds were caught in riparian habitats and translocated either within
   the riparian corridor of origin or across the urban matrix. Riparian
   treatments included continuous forest, one or several transportation
   bridges and a major river. In the urban matrix, birds were translocated
   across a single major road, well- or poorly-treed developed areas, or
   multiple gaps.
   4. Using Cox regression we found that the presence of gaps in forest
   cover explained more variation in return time than the amount of forest
   cover for both species. Multiple gaps, in particular, resulted in
   significantly longer return times compared with continuous forest.
   Chickadees exhibited longer return times when translocated across linear
   gaps associated with bridges or roads. In contrast, yellow warbler
   movements appeared to be more constrained by urban development.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that improving the
   permeability of urban landscapes for songbirds can be achieved by
   preserving connectivity along riparian corridors and other major swaths
   of natural vegetation while minimizing gaps in vegetation throughout the
   urban matrix. Our study also demonstrated a cumulative effect of
   multiple barriers, species-specific response thresholds to canopy cover
   and gap width, and an important effect of distance-to-territory on
   movement behaviour. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of `most
   forested route' as a new, animal-based approach for quantifying the
   permeability of heterogeneous landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods have moulded the
   evolutionary history of European cold-adapted organisms. The role of the
   different mountain massifs has, however, not been accurately
   investigated in the case of high-altitude insect species. Here, we focus
   on three closely related species of non-flying leaf beetles of the genus
   Oreina (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), which are often found in sympatry
   within the mountain ranges of Europe. After showing that the species
   concept as currently applied does not match barcoding results, we show,
   based on more than 700 sequences from one nuclear and three
   mitochondrial genes, the role of biogeography in shaping the
   phylogenetic hypothesis. Dating the phylogeny using an insect molecular
   clock, we show that the earliest lineages diverged more than 1 Mya and
   that the main shift in diversification rate occurred between 0.36 and
   0.18 Mya. By using a probabilistic approach on the parsimony-based
   dispersal/vicariance framework (MP-DIVA) as well as a direct likelihood
   method of state change optimization, we show that the Alps acted as a
   cross-roads with multiple events of dispersal to and reinvasion from
   neighbouring mountains. However, the relative importance of vicariance
   vs. dispersal events on the process of rapid diversification remains
   difficult to evaluate because of a bias towards overestimation of
   vicariance in the DIVA algorithm. Parallels are drawn with recent
   studies of cold-adapted species, although our study reveals novel
   patterns in diversity and genetic links between European mountains, and
   highlights the importance of neglected regions, such as the Jura and the

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{38}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Aim The funnelweb spider Macrothele calpeiana is endemic to the southern
   half of the Iberian Peninsula, but recent occurrence records from
   localities in Spain, North Africa and other regions of Europe, which are
   distant from its native populations, suggest human-mediated dispersal,
   probably associated with the commercial export of olive trees. The main
   goal of this study was to assess the environmental suitability of these
   new records and to discuss the spider's potential to become an invasive
   species, mainly in new regions across Central Europe and the
   Mediterranean Basin.
   Location Central Europe, Mediterranean Basin.
   Methods Using presence points from the Iberian native populations of M.
   calpeiana and a set of climatic variables, four presence-only algorithms
   (BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, GARP and Maxent) were applied to model the potential
   distribution of the spider. The models were transferred to Central
   Europe and the Mediterranean Basin, and the locations of the new records
   in both the occupied and potential environmental spaces were screened.
   Results The four models were generally congruent in predicting the
   existence of a suitable climate for the species across the Mediterranean
   Basin, although BIOCLIM and DOMAIN yielded more constrained predictions
   than GARP and Maxent. Whereas the new records from Central Europe were
   located far from the occupied and potential climatic spaces, those from
   the Iberian Peninsula were not.
   Main conclusions Climatic suitability together with propagule pressure
   owing to human activities will certainly enhance the opportunities for
   M. calpeiana to colonize new areas across the Mediterranean Basin. The
   species has invaded areas beyond its native range, and those new
   locations located in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa show
   environmental suitability for the spider and deserve long-term
   monitoring. Although the new locations in Central Europe were not
   predicted by the climate models and the persistence of the species seems
   improbable, the possibility of rapid evolution or phenotypic plasticity
   processes raises the need for caution over the possibility of a future
   spread of M. calpeiana across Europe. Stronger controls over the
   transport of trees must be applied, and further studies on the ecology
   of the spider are imperative to assess the possible impact on the
   invaded ecosystems.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{457-466}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Questions
   How are plant species distributed along grazing gradients? What is the
   shape of species richness patterns? How can we test for the existence of
   potential discontinuities in species turnover pattern?
   Location
   Semi-deserts in the eastern Caucasus, Azerbaijan, Gobustan district.
   Methods
   We studied the distribution of vascular plant species along transects
   900-m long, perpendicular to five farms, and estimated grazing intensity
   as current livestock units per distance. We modelled species response
   curves with Huismann-Olff-Fresco (HOF) models and calculated species
   turnover by accumulating the first derivatives of all response curves.
   To test for potential discontinuities in changes of vegetation
   composition along the grazing gradient, we introduce a new null model
   based on the individualistic continuum concept that uses permutations of
   the observed pattern of species responses.
   Results
   Most species show a sigmoidal negative response to grazing intensity,
   while a few species respond with a unimodal pattern. The monotonic
   decrease in species richness with increasing grazing intensity marks a
   process of overgrazing that leads to the complete extirpation of plant
   species. Although the species turnover pattern shows a clear peak, it
   does not deviate significantly from the null model of individualistic
   continuous changes.
   Conclusions
   Our approach offers a method for differentiating between transition
   zones and continuous shifts in species composition along ecological
   gradients. It also provides a valuable tool for rangeland management to
   test state-and-transition concepts and gives deeper insights into
   ecological processes affected by grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Questions
   What was the tree species composition of forests prior to European
   settlement at the northern hardwood range limit in eastern Quebec,
   Canada? What role did human activities play in the changes in forest
   composition in this region?
   Location
   Northern range limit of northern hardwoods in the Lower St. Lawrence
   region of eastern Quebec, Canada.
   Methods
   We used early land survey records (1846-1949) of public lands to
   reconstruct pre-settlement forest composition. The data consist of
   ranked tree species enumerations at points or for segments along
   surveyed lines, with enumerations of forest cover types and notes
   concerning disturbances. An original procedure was developed to weigh
   and combine these differing data types (line versus point observations;
   taxa versus cover enumerations). Change to present-day forest
   composition was evaluated by comparing survey records with forest
   decadal surveys conducted by the government of Quebec over the last 30
   years (1980-2009).
   Results
   Pre-settlement dominance of conifers was strong and uniform across the
   study area, whereas dominance of maple and birches was patchy. Cedar and
   spruce were less likely to dominate with increasing altitude, whereas
   maple displayed the reverse trend. Frequency of disturbances, especially
   logging and fire, increased greatly after 1900. Comparison of survey
   records and modern plots showed general increases for maple (mentioned
   frequency increased by 39\%), poplar (36\%) and paper birch (31\%).
   Considering only taxa ranked first by surveyors, cedar displayed the
   largest decrease (19\%), whereas poplar (15\%) and maple (9\%) increased
   significantly.
   Conclusions
   These changes in forest composition can be principally attributed to
   clear-cutting and colonization fire disturbances throughout the 20th
   century, and mostly reflected the propensity of taxa to expand
   (maples/aspen) or decline (cedar/spruce) with increased disturbance
   frequency. Quebec's land survey archives provide an additional data
   source to reconstruct and validate our knowledge of North America's
   pre-settlement temperate and sub-boreal forests.}},

Abstract = {{Ensuring good soil quality is essential to promoting plant growth in
   urban parks and building ecological resilience into a cityscape.
   Periodically used to restore a degraded urban ecosystem, parkland
   naturalization is a management approach designed to facilitate the
   return of an area to a natural state by largely discontinuing
   maintenance activities and restricting public access. This study
   investigates the potential for parkland naturalization to improve soil
   quality in a forested portion of Kew Gardens Park, Toronto, Canada by
   comparing soil physical properties in three six-year-old naturalization
   enclosures with those found in adjacent managed parkland. Soil texture,
   compaction, bulk density, and surface water infiltration rate were
   measured at 104 sample sites, while ordinary kriging was used to
   interpolate two-dimensional prediction surfaces representative of soil
   properties. Sand and loamy sand were the dominant soil texture classes
   found across the study site. Highly compacted soil (> 2,000 kPa) and
   soil with a bulk density > 1.8 Mg/m(3) (values sufficiently elevated to
   restrict tree root growth and respiration and impair soil water
   infiltration) were spatially correlated with high pedestrian traffic
   areas and corridors used by festival and park maintenance vehicles. In
   contrast, compaction and bulk density measurements in the naturalized
   areas were at or below thresholds known to impair root function within
   the naturalization enclosures but retarded to the point of surface
   pooling in parkland subjected to regular public use. In the absence of
   quantitative baseline data, our use of spatial analysis demonstrates
   that parkland naturalization is a good management practice for
   restoration of soil physical characteristics. While our results show
   improvements to soil properties in a relatively short period of time,
   variability in the soil response rate to parkland naturalization will be
   dependent upon disturbance history as well as on soil and climate type.}},

Volume = {{132}},

Abstract = {{Geodiversity, the natural range of geological, geomorphological and soil
   features, is thought to play a key role in the development of Australian
   ecosystems and evolution of their biota, due to the widespread
   occurrence of old soils with impoverished nutritional status and the
   comparatively restricted occurrence of fertile soils. While associations
   between soils and vegetation characteristics such as scleromorphy were
   first noted a century ago, modern theories propose evolutionary and
   ecological processes that shaped Australian flora and vegetation through
   interactions between soil nutrition, plant functional traits and
   flammability. Evidence in support of these generalisations comes mainly
   from site-specific empirical studies, surveys of plant traits and their
   associations, classification and mapping of land systems, analyses of
   regional environmental gradients and phylogenetic studies. The extent to
   which soils and the substrates from which they are derived place
   constraints on lie climatic response of biota has important implications
   for understanding future responses of the biota to anthropogenic climate
   change. Yet, worldwide, there are few studies that examine the relative
   contributions of geological substrates and climate to variation in
   vegetation properties over extensive sub-continental regions. This study
   used a spatially explicit approach to examine the relationship between
   vegetation and geological substrates over New South Wales, a region of
   80 million hectares in south-eastern Australia spanning,a diverse range
   of geology, vegetation and climate. It aimed to assess the fidelity of
   major vegetation types to geological substrates and estimate the overall
   influence of geodiversity on vegetation composition relative to that
   attributable to climate. The spatial data were drawn from maps produced
   by geological and vegetation surveys. Geological maps were re-classified
   into 16 broad units reflecting textural and mineral characteristics
   considered likely to be influential on plant growth. They represent a
   component of total geodiversity related to broad landscape-scale
   patterns in major bedrock and regolith types. Vegetation maps were
   re-classified in 16 broad formations reflecting structural, physiognomic
   and functional characteristics of vegetation, and into a larger number
   of 99 classes reflecting species composition. The two spatial data sets
   were analysed to determine the diversity of vegetation types within
   geological units and fidelity of each vegetation type to each geological
   unit. The relative influence of climatic co-variables was also examined
   using spatial surfaces spline-fitted to 30 years of weather station
   data. The results indicate a strong non-random relationship between
   vegetation and geodiversity, with most vegetation types restricted to a
   narrow range of geological substrates. Partial variance analyses
   indicated that the influence of geodiversity on vegetation composition
   was stronger than, and largely independent of the influence of climate.
   Consistent with current theories, sclerophyllous vegetation formations
   and classes showed a strong association with geological units
   characterised by low levels of mineral nutrients. It was concluded that
   landscape patterns of geodiversity are likely to place significant
   constraints on the response of native vegetation to future climate
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Many new and proposed emissions trading systems involve multiple

   with other firms in their country or region, provides a benchmark to
   assess the efficiency benefits of allowing linking. Although efficiency

Abstract = {{This paper represents a collaboration by conservation practitioners,

   prairies and oak savannas. We review climate model strengths and
   limitations, and summarize climate change projections and potential
   impacts on WPG prairies and oak savannas. We identify a set of six
   climate-smart strategies that do not require abandoning past management
   approaches but rather reorienting them towards a dynamic and uncertain
   future. These strategies focus on linking local and regional landscape
   characteristics to the emerging needs of species, including potentially
   novel species assemblages, so that prairies and savannas are maintained
   in locations and conditions that remain well-suited to their
   persistence. At the regional scale, planning should use the full range

   heterogeneity can be used to support species persistence by identifying
   key refugia. Climate change may marginalize sites currently used for
   agriculture and forestry, which may become good candidates for

Abstract = {{Land use is a pervasive influence on most terrestrial ecosystems. Humans
   are converting natural ecosystems and appropriating an increasingly
   large portion of the net primary productivity of the Earth's ecosystems,
   leaving a rapidly expanding footprint on the environment and threatening
   the functioning of ecosystems and the ecological services they provide.
   Understanding the impacts of human activities on the environment from a
   local to a global scale requires an adequate representation of human
   modified landscapes and an explanation of the relationships between
   socioeconomic and biophysical factors. A first step towards this
   objective is the development of a quantitative measure of the spatial
   footprint of humans on landscapes, which can then be used as an
   analytical and monitoring tool for global change, biodiversity and
   ecosystem studies. Existing approaches have been based mainly on
   geographic proxies of human influence such as population density, land
   transformation, accessibility and infrastructure. In this paper, we
   developed a more comprehensive and spatially-explicit footprint index
   based on three dimensions: land use intensity, intervention time, and
   biophysical vulnerability, which we then applied to Colombia as a case
   study. We found the inclusion of the vulnerability index provided an
   effective means to address regional variability in biophysical responses
   to land use impacts. Accounting for the duration of human intervention
   provided new insights into the relative capacity of ecosystems to
   recover or be restored. From this knowledge, more appropriate land use

   Grasslands}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Number = {{176}},
Pages = {{1-31}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Invasions by nonnative plants have changed the structure of many
   terrestrial ecosystems and altered important ecological processes such
   as fire, the dominant driver in grassland ecosystems. Reestablishing
   fire has been proposed as a mechanism to restore dominance of native
   plants in grasslands invaded by nonnative plants, yet fire may function
   differently in these altered systems, potentially affecting animals in
   novel ways. To assess whether invasions by nonnative plants alter the
   effects of fire on animals, we performed a manipulative experiment in
   semi-desert grasslands of southeastern Arizona that have been invaded by
   a perennial, nonnative grass from Africa, Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis
   lehmanniana). We applied fire to 36 of 54 1-ha plots established along
   an invasion gradient where dominance of E. lehmanniana ranged from 0\%
   to 91\% of total live plant biomass. Over the 5-year period from 2000 to
   2004, we used mark-recapture methods to assess how population and
   community attributes of small mammals varied along the gradient of
   nonnative grass and in response to fire. We quantified changes in
   presence of 17 species, abundance of 9 species, total abundance of all
   species combined, species richness, and species composition. Based on
   11,226 individual mammals from 24 species, we found that effects of
   nonnative-grass dominance varied with habitat preferences of each
   species, resulting in composition of the small-mammal community changing
   predictably along the invasion gradient. As dominance of nonnative grass
   increased, presence and abundance of granivorous heteromyids and
   insectivores (e. g., Chaetodipus, Perognathus, Onychomys; pocket mice
   and grasshopper mice) decreased, whereas presence and abundance of
   omnivorous and herbivorous murids (e. g., Reithrodontomys, Sigmodon;
   harvest mice and cotton rats) increased. Species richness of the
   small-mammal community averaged 8.4 species per plot and was highest at
   intermediate levels of nonnative-grass dominance where vegetation
   heterogeneity was greatest. Abundance of all small mammals combined
   averaged 26.9 individuals per plot and did not vary appreciably with
   nonnative-grass dominance. During the 4- to 8-week period immediately
   after fire, abundance of 6 of the 9 most common species changed, with 5
   species decreasing and 1 species increasing on burned plots relative to
   unburned plots. During this same time period, species richness of small
   mammals decreased by an average of 3 species (38\%) and total abundance
   of all species combined decreased by an average of 16 individuals (61\%)
   on burned plots relative to unburned plots. Effects of fire on
   vegetation biomass, on presence of 9 of 17 mammalian species, and on
   abundance of 4 of 9 mammalian species remained evident >= 2 years after
   fire. Effects of fire on most small-mammal species varied with the
   degree of nonnative-grass dominance, suggesting that fire functioned
   differently in areas invaded by nonnative plants relative to areas
   dominated by native plants. Specifically, effects of fire on presence of
   12 of 14 species and abundance of 7 of 9 species varied along the
   gradient of E. lehmanniana. During this post-fire period, however,
   composition of the small-mammal community in areas dominated by
   nonnative grass transitioned towards composition of areas dominated by
   native grasses, suggesting that fires had some restorative effect on
   habitat for small mammals. The relative strength of this effect will
   likely depend in general on the structural and compositional contrasts
   between invaded and native plant communities.
   Despite the reported neffectiveness of fire at reducing dominance of
   nonnative plants, restoring fire to grasslands invaded by nonnative
   plants can help maintain the mosaic of vegetation conditions necessary
   to support the diverse assemblage of animals that inhabit these
   fire-governed ecosystems. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the paper is to present two independent approaches to the
   issue of preservation of former meander loops based on examples of
   hydrotechnical works undertaken along meandering sections of the Drweca
   and Lyna Rivers (N Poland) in the 20th century. Except for significant
   changes in morphology of both rivers (shortened lengths, decrease in
   sinuosities and increase in channel slopes), the direct effect of their
   straightening is numerous cut-off channels. Hydrotechnical works
   performed along the middle section of the Lyna River maintained the
   connections between the active river channel and downstream arms of
   former meander loops. Thanks to that connection, the new water bodies
   successfully function as biogeochemical filters in the river valley and
   create favorable conditions for biodiversity. The consequence of the
   channelization of the Drweca River is numerous cut-offs separated from
   the river channel and characterized by advanced processes of
   eutrophication. The water quality data collected within the period of
   2004-2006 showed significant consequences of the performed works for the
   man-made ecosystems. The comparison of water quality in semi-lotic and
   lentic cut-offs in relation to water in their parent rivers showed
   statistical differences. Significantly high concentrations of
   orthophosphates, total phosphorus and sulphates as well as the lowest
   concentrations of nitrates characterized lentic environments along the
   Drweca River. Besides hydrological connectivity, an important factor
   responsible for transformation processes of the man-made ecosystems is
   hydrological regime. It influences ecological integrity in flood-plain
   ecosystems during high water levels and largely controls their chemical
   characteristics and aeration. Flood disturbances for lentic water bodies
   may renew connectivity and reset succession, can hold up the trend
   towards terrestrialization and disappearance of man-made water bodies in
   the floodplain. However, in light of the conducted studies, the
   maintenance of the connection between the downstream arm of the cut-off
   channel and the river is highly recommended. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The Phosphorus (P) Index concept is used in many states to help develop
   nutrient management plans for livestock agriculture to protect water
   quality. Although many P indices conceptually incorporate variable
   source area (VSA) runoff processes, they generally assume proximity to a
   water course is an adequate proxy of runoff risk. Here we propose a
   VSA-based transport factor that uses the topographic index concept to
   indicate runoff risk. We compared both transport factors based on the
   current New York State P Index and our VSA-based P Index to field
   measures of runoff probability across an abandoned agricultural site in
   upstate New York. We also compared transport factors and P indices using
   the current and VSA-based approaches on a farm in the Catskill Mountains
   of New York to evaluate differences at whole-field and farm scales.
   Field runoff-risk measurements were better correlated with VSA-based
   transport factor (r(2) = 0.63, alpha = 0.05) than with the current
   dissolved-P transport factor (r(2) = 0.40, alpha = 0.05). Although these
   point-scale differences in transport factor values translated into
   field-scale differences in transport factor, the net differences at the
   farm scale and in P Index were not very large. On a field-by-field
   basis, 12 out of 21 fields had different transport factor categories
   with the VSA method. However, the total land area classified as high
   risk changed very little between the two methods. There was more land
   classified as moderate risk using the VSA-based approach than using the
   current methods, due to some low risk areas being classified as higher
   risk and some high-risk areas being classified as lower risk. The VSA
   approach allows managers and producers to more easily manage farm units
   (e.g., fields) at finer resolutions both spatially and temporally, which
   will increase the options for managing nutrients on fields. These types
   of more rigorous links between management tools and physical hydrology,
   provide valuable :more scientifically defensible information for

Abstract = {{Identifying the critical time window during which climatic drivers
   affect the expression of phenological, behavioral, and demographic
   traits is crucial for predicting the impact of climate change on trait
   and population dynamics. Two widely used associative methods exist to
   identify critical climatic periods: sliding-window models and recursive
   operators in which the memory of past weather fades over time. Both
   approaches have different strong points, which we combine here into a
   single method. Our method uses flexible functions to differentially
   weight past weather, which can reflect competing hypotheses about time
   lags and the relative importance of recent and past weather for trait
   expression. Using a 22-year data set, we illustrate that the climatic
   window identified by our new method explains more of the phenological
   variation in a sexually selected trait than existing approaches. Our new
   method thus helps to better identify the critical time window and the
   causes of trait response to environmental variability.}},

Abstract = {{Control of the genome-wide type I error rate (GWER) is an important

   cannot account for population structure present in most association

   Bonferroni correction is applicable, but usually on the conservative
   side, because correlation of tests cannot be exploited. Therefore, a new
   approach is proposed, which controls the genomewide error rate, while
   accounting for population structure. This approach is based on a
   simulation procedure that is equally applicable in a linkage and an

Abstract = {{Riverine Irrawaddy dolphin populations are critically endangered and
   much uncertainty exists over the population status in the Mekong River
   of northeast Cambodia and southern Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao
   PDR). We conducted 11 surveys over three years to estimate abundance at
   each survey as well as survival and the probability of individuals
   becoming unavailable for detection between surveys. We utilized novel
   mark-resight estimators to account for the detection process in
   estimating these parameters. Annual survival was 0.977 (0.040 SE) and
   movement in (0.060) and out (0.018) of an observable state was low. We
   estimated abundance at 84.5 (95\% CI = 77.9-91.2) with little change
   over our surveys. We also estimated recruitment and population growth
   rate for the marked, and presumably older, individuals by estimating
   seniority using a reverse-time model. Seniority was estimated at 0.999
   (0.028 SE), recruitment at 0.001 and population growth rate at 0.978.
   Although the population size appears to be stable, we believe this
   represents the slow disappearance of a long-lived animal with no
   recruitment. Along with the isolated nature of the population and
   reduced population size as compared to historical estimates, we believe
   this population is in serious threat of extirpation. We believe there
   may be as few as 7 or 8 animals in Lao PDR and that the species is at
   risk of extinction there in the short-term. Although recent management
   actions (e.g., outlawing of explosive fishing and some restriction on
   the use of gill-nets) have likely been beneficial we believe identifying
   population goals to work towards, identifying additional management
   actions to improve recruitment, and designing the survey methods to best
   estimate the success of these actions is needed.}},

   shifts the origin of the dinosaur stem lineage back to the Early
   Olenekian (ca 249-251 Ma), approximately 5-9 Myr earlier than indicated

   records, and just a few million years after the Permian/Triassic mass
   extinction (252.3Ma). Dinosauromorph tracks are rare in all Polish
   assemblages, suggesting that these animals were minor faunal components.
   The oldest tracks are quadrupedal, a morphology uncommon among the
   earliest dinosauromorph body fossils, but bipedality and moderately
   large body size had arisen by the Early Anisian (ca 246 Ma). Integrating

Abstract = {{Tropical ecosystems play a large and complex role in the global carbon
   cycle. Clearing of natural ecosystems for agriculture leads to large
   pulses of CO(2) to the atmosphere from terrestrial biomass.
   Concurrently, the remaining intact ecosystems, especially tropical
   forests, may be sequestering a large amount of carbon from the
   atmosphere in response to global environmental changes including climate
   changes and an increase in atmospheric CO(2). Here we use an approach
   that integrates census-based historical land use reconstructions,
   remote-sensing-based contemporary land use change analyses, and
   simulation modeling of terrestrial biogeochemistry to estimate the net
   carbon balance over the period 1901-2006 for the state of Mato Grosso,
   Brazil, which is one of the most rapidly changing agricultural frontiers
   in the world. By the end of this period, we estimate that of the state's
   925 225 km(2), 221 092 km(2) have been converted to pastures and 89 533
   km(2) have been converted to croplands, with forest-to-pasture
   conversions being the dominant land use trajectory but with recent
   transitions to croplands increasing rapidly in the last decade. These
   conversions have led to a cumulative release of 4.8 Pg C to the
   atmosphere, with similar to 80\% from forest clearing and 20\% from the
   clearing of cerrado. Over the same period, we estimate that the residual
   undisturbed ecosystems accumulated 0.3 Pg C in response to CO2
   fertilization. Therefore, the net emissions of carbon from Mato Grosso
   over this period were 4.5 Pg C. Net carbon emissions from Mato Grosso
   since 2000 averaged 146 Tg C/yr, on the order of Brazil's fossil fuel
   emissions during this period. These emissions were associated with the
   expansion of croplands to grow soybeans. While alternative management
   regimes in croplands, including tillage, fertilization, and cropping
   patterns promote carbon storage in ecosystems, they remain a small
   portion of the net carbon balance for the region. This detailed
   accounting of a region's carbon balance is the type of foundation
   analysis needed by the new United Nations Collaborative Programmme for

Abstract = {{Forests strongly affect Earth's carbon cycles, making our ability to
   forecast forest-productivity changes associated with rising temperatures
   and changes in precipitation increasingly critical. In this study, we
   model the influence of climate on annual radial growth using lodgepole
   pine (Pinus contorta) trees grown for 34 years in a large provenance
   experiment in western Canada. We use a random-coefficient modeling
   approach to build universal growth-trend response functions that
   simultaneously incorporate the impacts of different provenance and site
   climates on radial growth trends under present and future annual
   (growth-year), summer, and winter climate regimes. This approach
   provides new depth to traditional quantitative genetics population
   response functions by illustrating potential changes in population
   dominance over time, as well as indicating the age and size at which
   annual growth begins declining for any population growing in any
   location under any present or future climate scenario within reason,
   given the ages and climatic conditions sampled. Our models indicate that
   lodgepole pine radial-growth levels maximize between 3.9 degrees and 5.1
   degrees C mean growth-year temperature. This translates to productivity
   declining by the mid-21st century in southern and central British
   Columbia (BC), while increasing beyond the 2080s in northern BC and
   Yukon, as temperatures rise. Relative to summer climate indices,
   productivity is predicted to decline continuously through the 2080s in
   all locations, while relative to winter climate variables, the opposite
   trend occurs, with the growth increases caused by warmer winters
   potentially offsetting the summer losses. Trees from warmer provenances,
   i.e., from the center of the species range, perform best in nearly all
   of our present and future climate-scenario models. We recommend that
   similar models be used to analyze population growth trends relative to
   annual and intra-annual climate in other large-scale provenance trials
   worldwide. An open-access growth-trend data set encompassing numerous
   biomes, species, and provenances would contribute substantially to
   predicting forest productivity under future-climate scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses five inter-related topics (the management of rivers,
   fire regimes, invasive alien species, rare antelope and elephants) to
   assess 15 years of adaptive management in the Kruger National Park
   (KNP), South Africa. The importance of adaptive planning (a process for
   developing achievable objectives, which is adaptive because objectives
   are revised as understanding grows), has been highlighted by this
   assessment, and the KNP's track record of adaptive planning is better
   than that of adaptive management. Adaptive management has identified
   important issues with regard to biodiversity conservation, and resulted
   in a shift in management focus to these issues. Because the conservation
   outcomes of management shifts will only manifest themselves in the
   longer term, the relative success of adaptive management should be
   measured by the degree to which management has been refocused onto
   priority issues, and by the rate at which new understanding is
   generated. Some issues previously seen as important (fire, rare
   antelope), are now regarded as less so, while others remain important
   and difficult to solve, although there has been some progress (rivers,
   alien plants and elephants). It has also proved difficult to implement
   active adaptive management (large-scale, replicated trials using
   different approaches), because of local variation and logistical
   problems. Adaptive management will remain the approach of choice because
   there is some progress, and no known alternative to managing this
   complex ecosystem. It is simply not an option to return to the
   easily-understood ``implementable{''} solutions (such as culling,
   regular prescribed burning, or artificial water provision) that
   demonstrably did not work. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   To assess the genealogical relationships of widespread montane
   rattlesnakes in the Crotalus triseriatus species group and to clarify
   the role of Late Neogene mountain building and Pleistocene pine-oak
   forest fragmentation in driving the diversification of Mexican highland
   taxa.
   Location
   Highlands of mainland Mexico and the south-western United States (Texas,
   New Mexico, and Arizona).
   Methods
   A synthesis of inferences was used to address several associated
   questions about the biogeography of the Mexican highlands and the
   evolutionary drivers of phylogeographical diversity in co-distributed
   taxa. We combined extensive range-wide sampling (130 individuals
   representing five putative species) and mixed-model phylogenetic
   analyses of 2408 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA to estimate
   genealogical relationships and divergence times within the C.
   triseriatus species group. We then assessed the tempo of diversification
   using a maximum likelihood framework based on the birth-death process.
   Estimated times of divergences provided a probabilistic temporal
   component and questioned whether diversification rates have remained
   constant or varied over time. Finally, we looked for phylogeographical
   patterns in other co-distributed taxa.
   Results
   We identified eight major lineages within the C. triseriatus group, and
   inferred strong correspondence between maternal and geographic history
   within most lineages. At least one cryptic species was detected.
   Relationships among lineages were generally congruent with previous
   molecular studies, with differences largely attributable to our expanded
   taxonomic and geographic sampling. Estimated divergences between most
   major lineages occurred in the Late Miocene and Pliocene.
   Phylogeographical structure within each lineage appeared to have been
   generated primarily during the Pleistocene. Although the scale of
   genetic diversity recognized affected estimated rates of
   diversification, rates appeared to have been constant through time.
   Main conclusions
   The biogeographical history of the C. triseriatus group implies a
   dynamic history for the highlands of Mexico. The Neogene formation of
   the Transvolcanic Belt appears responsible for structuring geographic
   diversity among major lineages. Pleistocene glacial-interglacial
   climatic cycles and resultant expansions and contractions of the Mexican
   pine-oak forest appear to have driven widespread divergences within
   lineages. Climatic change, paired with the complex topography of Mexico,
   probably produced a myriad of species-specific responses in
   co-distributed Mexican highland taxa. The high degree of genetic
   differentiation recovered in our study and others suggests that the
   Mexican highlands may contain considerably more diversity than currently
   recognized.}},

Abstract = {{Human-induced alterations in the birth and mortality rates of species
   and in the strength of interactions within and between species can lead
   to changes in the structure and resilience of ecological communities.
   Recent research points to the importance of considering the distribution
   of body sizes of species when exploring the response of communities to
   such perturbations. Here, we present a new size-based approach for
   assessing the sensitivity and elasticity of community structure (species
   equilibrium abundances) and resilience (rate of return to equilibrium)
   to changes in the intrinsic growth rate of species and in the strengths
   of species interactions. We apply this approach on two natural systems,
   the pelagic communities of the Baltic Sea and Lake Vattern, to
   illustrate how it can be used to identify potential keystone species and
   keystone links. We find that the keystone status of a species is closely
   linked to its body size. The analysis also suggests that communities are
   structurally and dynamically more sensitive to changes in the effects of
   prey on their consumers than in the effects of consumers on their prey.
   Moreover, we discuss how community sensitivity analysis can be used to
   study and compare the fragility of communities with different body size
   distributions by measuring the mean sensitivity or elasticity over all
   species or all interaction links in a community. We believe that the
   community sensitivity analysis developed here holds some promise for
   identifying species and links that are critical for the structural and

Abstract = {{Question: Are long-unburnt patches of eucalypt forest important for
   maintaining floristic diversity?
   Location: Eucalyptus forests of southeastern New South Wales, Australia.
   Methods: Data from 976 sites representing a range of fire history from
   three major vegetation formations - shrubby dry sclerophyll forest (SF),
   grassy dry SF and wet SF - were analysed. Generalized linear models were
   used to examine changes in species richness with increasing time since
   wildfire and analysis of similarities to examine changes in community
   composition. Chi-squared tests were conducted to examine the
   distribution of individual species across four time since fire
   categories.
   Results: Plant species relationships to fire varied between the three
   formations. Shrubby dry SF supported lower plant species richness with
   increasing time since wildfire and this was associated with shifts in
   community composition. Grassy dry SF showed significant shifts in
   community composition and species richness in relation to time, with a
   peak in plant species richness 20-30 yr post fire (either prescribed
   fire or wildfire). Wet SF increased in species richness until 10-20 yr
   post wildfire then displayed a general declining trend. Species richness
   in each vegetation type was not related to the fire frequencies and fire
   intervals observed in this study.
   Conclusions: Long-unburnt (30-50 yr post wildfire) forests appeared to
   play a minor role in the maintenance of plant species diversity in dry
   forest systems, although this was more significant in wet forests.
   Maintenance of a range of fire ages within each vegetation formation
   will assist in maintaining floristic diversity within regions.}},

Abstract = {{Tallgrass prairie butterfly surveys in recent decades in four states in

   including Speyeria idalia, Oarisma poweshiek, Atrytone arogos, Hesperia

   high-quality ones. These results replicate previous findings, indicating
   that upon initiation of conservation action, both cessation of prior
   management and inception of new management affect specialists negatively
   and that butterfly declines can be as great on reserves as non-reserves.
   Results at Wisconsin sites with species-specific management protocols,
   including permanent non-fire refugia, were more favorable for the
   specialists (S. idalia, Lycaeides melissa samuelis) the protocols were
   specifically designed to benefit. Butterfly declines after preservation
   will likely continue unless the conservation approach changes to include
   consideration of individual species' required resources and management
   tolerances. The ecosystem approach assumes that habitat specialists are
   co-evolved with processes such as fires assumed to maintain those
   ecosystems. Data presented here indicate that tallgrass prairie
   specialist butterflies are not co-evolved with current fire regimes. An
   alternate perspective views ecological processes as resetting vegetation
   to current climate and landscape conditions. Over geologic time, relict
   vegetation associations persist as outliers until an event resets them.
   In modern times, human disturbances (especially soil-exposing ones) can
   reset sites to favour the more generalist species (plants and

Abstract = {{The limpet, Nacella concinna, collected from the Antarctic Peninsula (67
   S), was incubated at -0.3 degrees C and 2.9 degrees C for 9 months to
   test if the previously reported absence of acclimation capacity in
   Antarctic marine ectotherms could be due to the extended time it takes
   for them to adjust their physiology to a new stable state. Acclimation
   was tested through acute measurements of upper lethal limit and a
   modified measure of tenacity, that tested muscle capacity by measuring
   the length of time that N. concinna were able to remain attached to the
   substratum at different temperatures. Both measures acclimated in
   response to incubation to the higher temperature. Lethal limits were
   elevated in N. concinna incubated at 2.9 degrees C (8.1 +/- 0.3 degrees
   C) compared to those incubated at -0.3 degrees C (6.9 +/- 0.4 degrees
   C). 2.9 degrees C incubated N. concinna also had a maximum tenacity at
   2.1 degrees C. a higher temperature than the maximum tenacity of those
   incubated at -0.3 degrees C, which occurred at -1.0 degrees C. This
   study is the first to show that the Antarctic limpet can acclimate its
   physiology, but that it requires a greater period of time for
   acclimation to occur than previous studies have allowed for. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of responses of understory plants to disturbance is
   essential for understanding the efficacy of management activities.
   However, the ability to assess changes in the abundance of plants may be
   hampered by inappropriate sampling methodologies. Conventional methods
   for sampling understory plants may be precise for common species but may
   fail to adequately characterize abundance of less common species. We
   tested conventional (modified Whittaker plots and Daubenmire and
   point-line intercept transects) and novel (strip adaptive cluster
   sampling {[}SACS]) approaches to sampling understory plants to determine
   their efficacy for quantifying abundance on control and
   thinned-and-burned treatment units in Pinus ponderosa forests in western
   Montana, USA. For species grouped by growth-form and for common species,
   all three conventional designs were capable of estimating cover with a
   50\% relative margin of error with reasonable sample sizes (3-36
   replicates for growth-form groups; 8-14 replicates for common species);
   however, increasing precision to 25\% relative margin of error required
   sample sizes that may be infeasible (11-143 replicates for growthform
   groups; 28-54 replicates for common species). All three conventional
   designs required enormous sample sizes to estimate cover of nonnative
   species as a group (29-60 replicates) and of individual less common
   species (62-118 replicates), even with a 50\% relative margin of error.
   SACS was the only design that efficiently sampled less common species,
   requiring only 6-11\% as many replicates relative to conventional
   designs. Conventional designs may not be effective for estimating
   abundance of the majority of forest understory plants, which are
   typically patchily distributed with low abundance, or of newly
   establishing nonnative plants. Novel methods such as SACS should be
   considered in investigations when cover of these species is of concern.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The role of dispersal versus vicariance for plant distribution
   patterns has long been disputed. We study the temporal and spatial
   diversification of Ranunculeae, an almost cosmopolitan tribe comprising
   19 genera, to understand the processes that have resulted in the present
   inter-continental disjunctions.
   Location All continents (except Antarctica).
   Methods Based on phylogenetic analyses of nuclear and chloroplast DNA
   sequences for 18 genera and 89 species, we develop a temporal-spatial
   framework for the reconstruction of the biogeographical history of
   Ranunculeae. To estimate divergence dates, Bayesian uncorrelated rates
   analyses and four calibration points derived from geological, fossil and
   external molecular information were applied. Parsimony-based methods for
   dispersal-vicariance analysis (diva and Mesquite) and a maximum
   likelihood-based method (LAGRANGE) were used for reconstructing
   ancestral areas. Six areas corresponding to continents were delimited.
   Results The reconstruction of ancestral areas is congruent in the diva
   and maximum likelihood-based analyses for most nodes, but Mesquite
   reveals equivocal results at deep nodes. Our study suggests a Northern
   Hemisphere origin for the Ranunculeae in the Eocene and a weakly
   supported vicariance event between North America and Eurasia. The
   Eurasian clade diversified between the early Oligocene and the late
   Miocene, with at least three independent migrations to the Southern
   Hemisphere. The North American clade diversified in the Miocene and
   dispersed later to Eurasia, South America and Africa.
   Main conclusions Ranunculeae diversified between the late Eocene and the
   late Miocene. During this time period, the main oceanic barriers already
   existed between continents and thus dispersal is the most likely
   explanation for the current distribution of the tribe. In the Southern
   Hemisphere, a vicariance model related to the break-up of Gondwana is
   clearly rejected. Dispersals between continents could have occurred via
   migration over land bridges, such as the Bering Land Bridge, or via
   long-distance dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, one of the biggest challenges in microbial and ecosystem
   ecology is to develop conceptual models that organize the growing body
   of information on environmental microbiology into a clear mechanistic
   framework with a direct link to ecosystem processes. Doing so will
   enable development of testable hypotheses to better direct future
   research and increase understanding of key constraints on biogeochemical
   networks. Although the understanding of phenotypic and genotypic
   diversity of microorganisms in the environment is rapidly accumulating,
   how controls on microbial physiology ultimately affect biogeochemical
   fluxes remains poorly understood. We propose that insight into
   constraints on biogeochemical cycles can be achieved by a more rigorous
   evaluation of microbial community biomass composition within the context
   of ecological stoichiometry. Multiple recent studies have pointed to
   microbial biomass stoichiometry as an important determinant of when
   microorganisms retain or recycle mineral nutrients. We identify the
   relevant cellular components that most likely drive changes in microbial
   biomass stoichiometry by defining a conceptual model rooted in
   ecological stoichiometry. More importantly, we show how X-ray
   microanalysis (XRMA), nanoscale secondary ion mass spectroscopy
   (NanoSIMS), Raman microspectroscopy, and in situ hybridization
   techniques (for example, FISH) can be applied in concert to allow for
   direct empirical evaluation of the proposed conceptual framework. This
   approach links an important piece of the ecological literature,
   ecological stoichiometry, with the molecular front of the microbial
   revolution, in an attempt to provide new insight into how microbial
   physiology could constrain ecosystem processes.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   Bringing new approaches to trace spatiotemporal variations in animals'
   feeding ecology, which is fundamental for wildlife management and
   conservation since the accessibility of animals to trophic resources
   plays a key role in the dynamics of populations and metapopulations.
   Location
   Western Mediterranean coast.
   Methods
   The analysis of naturally occurring stable isotopes constitutes an
   exceptional approach to assess variations in the trophic ecology of
   species within the spatiotemporal dimensions. Here, we examined the
   spatiotemporal heterogeneity in resource exploitation of a nuisance and
   overpopulated gull species with a great feeding plasticity, the
   Yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis, by measuring the stable isotope
   ratios of carbon (13C/12C, delta 13C), nitrogen (15N/14N, delta 15N) and
   sulphur (34S/33S, delta 34S) in different wing feathers.
   Results
   Tracing isotopic changes among feathers in relation to moulting
   sequence, we showed that isotopic analyses on first primary feathers
   were good indicators of breeding trophic ecology, while others, such as
   eighth secondary feathers, reflected the feeding behaviour during the
   non-breeding period. This knowledge was then used to report on
   estimations of seasonal feeding patterns throughout the year for seven
   gull populations along the Western Mediterranean coast.
   Main conclusions
   The high diversity in the exploitation patterns of the foraging habitats
   found in the study area both at spatial and at temporal scale indicated
   the opportunistic feeding behaviour of Yellow-legged gulls. Proposed
   isotopic approach has revealed as a useful tool to evaluate
   spatiotemporal variations in the feeding ecology of populations which
   may become clue for dealing with the management of wild species, not
   only nuisance populations but also endangered species. We finally
   pointed out the relevance of the isotopic variability among individuals
   to infer diet diversity and food availability of a given population,
   thereby allowing demographic forecasts when trophic resources vary in
   abundance.}},

Abstract = {{We examined responses of benthic macroinvertebrate communities to
   natural geothermal discharges in 32 streams in Yellowstone National Park
   (YNP), USA. Geothermal discharges played a major role in structuring
   benthic communities in YNP, as downstream communities were characterized
   by low species richness, reduced abundance of EPT taxa and increased
   abundance of tolerant caddisflies (Trichoptera), chironomids and
   non-insects. While some taxa were a subset of tolerant organisms that
   were also common at references sites, others (the damselfly Argia sp.,
   the caddisfly Oxyethira sp. and the exotic New Zealand mudsnail
   Potamopyrgus antipodarum Gray 1843) were found almost exclusively in
   geothermal streams. Because geothermal waters are a common feature of
   YNP, monitoring programs designed to assess long-term status and trends
   of Yellowstone's aquatic ecosystems must account for the influence of
   these discharges. To separate geothermal effects from other potential
   anthropogenic disturbances in YNP (e.g., atmospheric deposition, road
   construction, wastewater, global change), we developed a multimetric
   index based on responses of benthic communities to geothermal
   discharges. Streams were placed into one of four geothermal categories
   based on conductivity (reference = < 150 mu S/cm; low, moderate and high
   = 151-300, 301-600 and > 600 mu S/cm, respectively). The index clearly
   distinguished among these categories and showed a well-defined threshold
   response to geothermal effects at very low levels of conductivity.
   Although the index was specific to geothermal effects, the approach used
   to develop the index has broad applicability for other systems where
   impacts of stressors must be assessed within the context of natural
   environmental gradients. Our findings may provide important insights
   into how benthic macroinvertebrate communities respond to global change.
   Reduced discharge and warmer temperatures predicted for Rocky Mountain
   streams may favor the establishment and expansion of exotic species such
   as New Zealand mudsnails (P. antipodarum), which are highly tolerant of
   geothermal influences.}},

Abstract = {{Many organisms exhibit ontogenetic shifts in their diet and habitat use,
   which often exert a large influence on the structure and expected
   dynamics of food webs and ecological communities. Nevertheless, reliable
   methods for detecting these niche shifts from consumption data are
   limited. In this study we present a new approach for the detection and
   analysis of ontogenetic diet shifts, based on complex network theory. As
   a case study, we apply these methods to the endangered, small fish
   Aphanius iberus. The stage-structured consumer population and its set of
   consumed prey are represented as an unweighted bipartite network. A
   statistical evaluation of the resulting network structure permits to
   uncover empirical patterns of ontogenetic diet shifts. We test for
   changes in niche breadth, as well as nestedness and diet modularity
   along ontogeny. These tests were carried out on the subnetworks
   describing consumption, positive electivity, and negative electivity on
   prey items. The statistical significance was established by means of
   null model analyses. Our analyses reveal a nested diet, along with a
   gradual decrease in diet breadth and a modular structure (i.e. abrupt
   changes) of elected preys along the ontogeny of A. iberus. The detection
   of network structure by means of the use of tools from complex network
   theory is shown to be a promising method for studying ontogenetic niche

Abstract = {{An indicator framework was designed as an operational science-based tool
   for the evaluation of the environmental aspects of sustainable forest
   management at stand level in Flanders (Belgium). The framework aims to
   assess the effects of forest management on forest composition, structure

   which 157 potential indicators, selected from literature, were assigned;
   40 of these were considered as suitable by an expert panel, based on 10
   operational selection criteria. All indicators were quantitative
   variables measurable in the field.
   After elaboration of a measurement protocol, the indicator framework was
   validated in 115 forest stands, distributed over the three main forest
   types of Flanders. The new indicator framework exhibited greater
   sensitivity to forest management practices and demonstrated better
   discriminating power than the method that is currently used by the
   Flemish forest administration to estimate the naturalness and
   environmental quality of a forest stand. Following a detailed cost
   calculation of each indicator and based on the sensitivity of each
   indicator to forest management practices, the indicator framework was
   further reduced to a final set of 29 indicators. This framework can also
   be applied in other regions, provided that local threshold values are

Abstract = {{The field of ecohydrology is providing new theoretical frameworks and
   methodological approaches for understanding the complex interactions and
   feedbacks between vegetation and hydrologic flows at multiple scales.
   Here we review some of the major scientific and technological advances
   in ecohydrology as related to understanding the mechanisms by which
   plant-water relations influence water fluxes at ecosystem, watershed and
   landscape scales.
   We identify several cross-cutting themes related to the role of
   plant-water relations in the ecohydrological literature, including the
   contrasting dynamics of water-limited and water-abundant ecosystems,
   transferring information about water fluxes across scales, understanding
   spatiotemporal heterogeneity and complexity, ecohydrological triggers
   associated with threshold behavior and shifts between alternative stable
   states and the need for long-term data sets at multiple scales. We then
   show how these themes are embedded within three key research areas where
   improved understanding of the linkages between plant-water relations and
   the hydrologic cycle have led to important advances in the field of
   ecohydrology: upscaling water fluxes from the leaf to the watershed and
   landscape, effects of plant-soil interactions on soil moisture dynamics
   and controls exerted by plant water use patterns and mechanisms on
   streamflow regime. In particular, we highlight several pressing
   environmental challenges facing society today where ecohydrology can
   contribute to the scientific knowledge for developing sound management

Abstract = {{Bashari et al. (2009) propose combining state and transition models
   (STMs) with Bayesian networks for decision support tools where the focus
   is on modelling the system dynamics. There is already an extension of
   Bayesian networks - so-called dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) - for
   explicitly modelling systems that change over time, that has also been
   applied in ecological modelling. In this paper we propose a combination
   of STMs and DBNs that overcome some of the limitations of Bashari et
   al.'s approach including providing an explicit representation of the
   next state, while retaining its advantages, such an the explicit
   representation of transitions. We then show that the new model can be
   applied iteratively to predict into the future consistently with
   different time frames. We use Bashari et al.'s rangeland management
   problem as an illustrative case study. We present a comparative
   complexity analysis of the different approaches, based on the structure
   inherent in the problem being modelled. This analysis showed that any
   models that explicitly represent all the transitions only remain
   tractable when there are natural constraints in the domain. Thus we
   recommend modellers should analyse these aspects of their problem before
   deciding whether to use the framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Crown fire endangers fire fighters and can have severe ecological
   consequences. Prediction of fire behavior in tree crowns is essential to
   informed decisions in fire management. Current methods used in fire
   management do not address variability in crown fuels. New mechanistic
   physics-based fire models address convective heat transfer with
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and can be used to model fire in
   heterogeneous crown fuels. However, the potential impacts of variability
   in crown fuels on fire behavior have not yet been explored. In this
   study we describe a new model, FUEL3D, which incorporates the pipe model
   theory (PMT) and a simple 3D recursive branching approach to model the
   distribution of fuel within individual tree crowns. FUEL3D uses forest
   inventory data as inputs, and stochastically retains geometric
   variability observed in field data. We investigate the effects of crown
   fuel heterogeneity on fire behavior with a CFD fire model by simulating
   fire under a homogeneous tree crown and a heterogeneous tree crown
   modeled with FUEL3D, using two different levels of surface fire
   intensity. Model output is used to estimate the probability of tree
   mortality, linking fire behavior and fire effects at the scale of an
   individual tree. We discovered that variability within a tree crown
   altered the timing, magnitude and dynamics of how fire burned through
   the crown; effects varied with surface fire intensity. In the lower
   surface fire intensity case, the heterogeneous tree crown barely ignited
   and would likely survive, while the homogeneous tree had nearly 80\%
   fuel consumption and an order of magnitude difference in total net
   radiative heat transfer. In the higher surface fire intensity case, both
   cases burned readily. Differences for the homogeneous tree between the
   two surface fire intensity cases were minimal but were dramatic for the
   heterogeneous tree. These results suggest that heterogeneity within the
   crown causes more conditional, threshold-like interactions with fire. We
   conclude with discussion of implications for fire behavior modeling and
   fire ecology. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   The ARIRS envirogram summarizes hierarchically organized, within- and

   obvious that growth is influenced by many cross-scale spatiotemporal

Abstract = {{Gap analysis is a protocol for assessing the extent to which valued
   biodiversity attributes are represented within protected areas. Such
   analysis involves overlaying the distribution of biodiversity features
   (e.g. species) with protected areas, but the protocol entails arbitrary
   assumptions that affect the outcome of the assessments. In particular,
   since species' distributions are usually mapped at a coarser resolution
   than protected areas, rules have to be defined to match the two data
   layers. Typically, a grid cell is considered protected if a given
   proportion is covered by protected areas. Because the effectiveness of
   protected areas is dependent on the definition of such arbitrary
   proportions (i.e., thresholds), errors of commission and omission in the
   level of species' representation are bound to exist. We propose an
   alternative approach whereby the contribution of a cell for the
   representation of species is defined as the expected value of a
   hyper-geometric random variable. We compare the conventional approach
   based on fixed thresholds with this new probability-based approach for
   both static and dynamic conservation scenarios, using a virtual dataset
   and a 100-plant-species' dataset for Iberian Peninsula. Results support
   the view that traditional fixed thresholds yield inconsistent results.
   Because species present different distributional patterns coinciding
   differently with protected areas, species-specific and time-specific
   thresholds should be used. Our approach enables to easily obtain these
   more adequate threshold values, thus offering a promising method for gap
   analyses. Future studies should seek to evaluate the performance of this
   method empirically in different conservation planning contexts. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Our goal was to reconstruct the late eighteenth century forest
   vegetation of the Prignitz region (NE Germany) at a scale of 1:50,000.
   We also wanted to relate the historical forest vegetation to the actual
   and potential natural vegetation. For these purposes, we selected 15
   woody species and transferred relevant data found in historical records
   from various sources together with the recent localities of (very) old
   individuals belonging to these woody species into ArcView GIS. Following
   multi-step data processing including the generation of a point density
   layer using a moving window with kernel estimation and derivation of
   vegetation units applying Boolean algebra rules together with
   information on site conditions, we derived 17 forest communities
   corresponding to the potential natural vegetation. We were able to
   reconstruct the historical forest vegetation for 90\% of the forest area
   ca. 1780. Only two of the 17 forest communities covered large parts of
   the forested area. The oak forest with Agrostis capillaris covered about
   44\% of the total forest area, and alder forests on fenland made up
   about 37\%. Oak-hornbeam forests with Stellaria holostea comprised
   slightly less than 6\% of the forest area, while all other forest
   communities comprised less than 1\%. The historical forest vegetation is
   more similar to the potential forest vegetation and quite different from
   the actual forest vegetation because coniferous tree species currently
   cover approximately two-thirds of the actual forest area. The most
   beneficial result of this study is the map of high-resolution historical
   vegetation units that may serve as the basis for various further
   studies, e.g., modelling long-term changes in biodiversity at the

Abstract = {{The invasion of woody plants into grass-dominated ecosystems has
   occurred worldwide during the past century with potentially significant
   impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, ecosystem carbon
   sequestration and global climate warming. To date, most studies of tree
   and shrub encroachment impacts on SOC have been conducted at small
   scales and results are equivocal. To quantify the effects of woody plant
   proliferation on SOC at broad spatial scales and to potentially resolve
   inconsistencies reported from studies conducted at fine spatial scales,
   information regarding spatial variability and uncertainty of SOC is
   essential. We used sequential indicator simulation (SIS) to quantify
   spatial uncertainty of SOC in a grassland undergoing shrub encroachment
   in the Southern Great Plains, USA. Results showed that both SOC pool
   size and its spatial uncertainty increased with the development of woody
   communities in grasslands. Higher uncertainty of SOC in new
   shrub-dominated communities may be the result of their relatively recent
   development, their more complex above- and belowground architecture,
   stronger within-community gradients, and a greater degree of faunal
   disturbance. Simulations of alternative sampling designs demonstrated
   the effects of spatial uncertainty on the accuracy of SOC estimates and
   enabled us to evaluate the efficiency of sampling strategies aimed at
   quantifying landscape-scale SOC pools. An approach combining stratified
   random sampling with unequal point densities and transect sampling of
   landscape elements exhibiting strong internal gradients yielded the best
   estimates. Complete random sampling was less effective and required much
   higher sampling densities. Results provide novel insights into spatial
   uncertainty of SOC and its effects on estimates of carbon sequestration
   in terrestrial ecosystem and suggest effective protocol for the
   estimating of soil attributes in landscapes with complex vegetation
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Question: How do aggregate trait values and functional diversity of leaf
   traits linked to palatability and decomposability change during a woody
   post-cultural succession spanning 200 years?
   Location: Coastal Marlborough, South Island, New Zealand.
   Methods: The biomass of all woody species was determined in 32 20-m x
   20-m plots ranging from 10 to 200 years in time since last disturbance.
   Species abundances were combined with data on leaf nutrient, secondary
   metabolite and structural carbohydrate content to calculate
   biomass-weighted trait means (i.e. aggregate trait values) and
   functional diversity index values for each plot. Aggregate trait values
   and functional diversity were regressed on successional age and total
   live above-ground carbon content to examine functional shifts with
   succession and one consequence of succession - increasing above-ground
   carbon.
   Results: Almost all significant regressions between aggregate trait
   values and both successional age and above-ground carbon indicated a
   shift toward increased leaf palatability and decomposability during
   succession. The relationships were all non-linear, with aggregate trait
   value shifts occurring relatively early in the successional sequence.
   There was weak evidence for an increase in functional richness with
   succession, but this was a secondary effect relative to the shifts in
   aggregate trait values.
   Conclusions: These results are in direct contrast with studies of the
   early stages of herbaceous post-cultural successions from grasslands to
   shrublands, which have found a shift towards communities of decreasing
   palatability and decomposability, suggesting that functional shifts in
   woody succession may be fundamentally different.}},

Abstract = {{Total forest carbon (C) storage is determined by succession,
   disturbances, climate, and the edaphic properties of a site or region.
   Forest harvesting substantially affects C dynamics; these effects may be
   amplified if forest harvesting is intensified to provide biofuel
   feedstock. We tested the effects of harvest intensity on landscape C
   using a simulation modeling approach that included C dynamics, multiple
   disturbances, and successional changes in composition. We developed a
   new extension for the LANDIS-II forest landscape disturbance and
   succession model that incorporates belowground soil C dynamics derived
   from the CENTURY soil model. The extension was parameterized and
   calibrated using data from an experimental forest in northeastern
   Wisconsin, USA. We simulated a 9800 ha forested landscape over 400 years
   with wind disturbance combined with no harvesting, harvesting with
   residual slash left on site ('standard harvest'), and whole-tree
   harvesting. We also simulated landscapes without wind disturbance and
   without eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) to examine the effects of
   detrital quantity and quality on C dynamics. We estimated changes in
   live C, detrital C, soil organic C, total C, and forest composition.
   Overall, the simulations without harvesting had substantially greater
   total C and continued to sequester C. Standard harvest simulations had
   more C than the whole tree harvest simulations. Under both harvest
   regimes, C accrual was not evident after 150 years. Without hemlock, SOC
   was reduced due to a decline in detritus and a shift in detrital
   chemistry. In conclusion, if the intensity of harvesting increases we
   can expect a corresponding reduction in potential C storage.
   Compositional changes due to historic circumstances (loss of hemlock)
   may also affect forest C although to a lesser degree than harvesting.
   The modeling approach presented enabled us to consider multiple,
   interacting drivers of landscape change and the subsequent changes in

Abstract = {{The major processes generating pattern in plant community composition
   depend upon the spatial scale and resolution of observation, therefore
   understanding the role played by spatial scale on species patterns is of
   major concern. In this study, we investigate how well environmental
   (topography and soil variables) and spatial variables explain variation
   in species composition in a 25-ha temperate forest in northeastern
   China. We used new variation partitioning approaches to discover the
   spatial scale (using multi-scale spatial PCNM variables) at which
   environmental heterogeneity and other spatially structured processes
   influence tree community composition. We also test the effect of
   changing grain of the study (i.e. quadrat size) on the variation
   partitioning results. Our results indicate that (I) species composition
   in the Changbai mixed broadleaf-conifer forest was controlled mainly by
   spatially structured soil variation at broad scales, while at finer
   scales most of the explained variation was of a spatial nature, pointing
   to the importance of biotic processes. (2) These results held at all
   sampling grains. However, reducing quadrat size progressively reduced
   both spatially and environmentally explained variance. This probably
   partly reflects increasing stochasticity in species abundances, and the
   smaller proportion of quadrats occupied by each species, when quadrat
   size is reduced. The results suggest that environmental heterogeneity

   together, but at different spatial scales, to build up diversity

Abstract = {{The El Nino Southern Oscillation is the dominant year-to-year mode of
   global climate variability. El Nino effects on terrestrial carbon
   cycling are mediated by associated climate anomalies, primarily drought,
   influencing fire emissions and biotic net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Here
   we evaluate whether El Nino produces a consistent response from the
   global carbon cycle. We apply a novel bottom-up approach to estimating
   global NEE anomalies based on FLUXNET data using land cover maps and
   weather reanalysis. We analyze 13 years (1997-2009) of globally gridded
   observational NEE anomalies derived from eddy covariance flux data,
   remotely-sensed fire emissions at the monthly time step, and NEE
   estimated from an atmospheric transport inversion. We evaluate the
   overall consistency of biospheric response to El Nino and, more
   generally, the link between global CO2 flux anomalies and El
   Nino-induced drought. Our findings, which are robust relative to
   uncertainty in both methods and time-lags in response, indicate that
   each event has a different spatial signature with only limited spatial
   coherence in Amazonia, Australia and southern Africa. For most regions,
   the sign of response changed across El Nino events. Biotic NEE
   anomalies, across 5 El Nino events, ranged from -1.34 to +0.98 Pg C
   yr(-1), whereas fire emissions anomalies were generally smaller in
   magnitude (ranging from -0.49 to +0.53 Pg C yr(-1)). Overall drought
   does not appear to impose consistent terrestrial CO2 flux anomalies
   during El Ninos, finding large variation in globally integrated
   responses from -1.15 to +0.49 Pg C yr(-1). Despite the significant
   correlation between the CO2 flux and El Nino indices, we find that El
   Nino events have, when globally integrated, both enhanced and weakened
   terrestrial sink strength, with no consistent response across events.}},

Pages = {{269-277}},
Abstract = {{The case study on the small Danish post-glacial Lake Glumso shows some
   of the highlights of aquatic ecosystem research over the time span of
   more than 30 years. The research at Lake Glumso is closely linked to the
   development of ecological modelling as a discipline, inspired a wide
   range of related working approaches as well as advancements in
   ecological modelling and the development in ecological theory.
   In the early working phase, models based on differential equations were
   used not only to describe the lake processes but also to
   methodologically identify the optimal formalisation of the described
   processes. First, modelling applications were continuously improved,
   thus providing a large body of functional representations for the
   different compartments. A result of the intense discussions of the early
   model structures was a new approach called structural dynamic modeling
   which allowed for varying numbers of variables and a model structure
   that could change during simulation time. Continuing the search for
   optimal trade-off between model complexity on one side and efficiency
   and precision on the other side, machine learning techniques were
   applied to find out, whether this could help to identify the most
   reasonable model structures which were tested with Lake Glumso data and
   many other lakes world wide. In further contributions to ecological
   theory, the question was tackled whether overall ecosystem
   characteristics, like exergy, biomass production or species composition,
   do converge in a successional process towards optimal values. This led
   to the development of ecosystem goal functions, which was part of an
   international ecosystem research debate on the theoretical patterning
   and the dynamics of ecosystems.
   Collaborating research groups on ecosystem research benefited very much
   from the experiences made and the knowledge gained from the Lake Glumso
   studies.}},

Pages = {{173-187}},
Abstract = {{Context. Environmental benefits of timber plantations have been a major
   selling point for land use change from previously cleared farmland, but
   data concerning the response of biodiversity are scarce.
   Aims. We investigated the use of young (4-11 years old) timber
   plantations by bats in comparison with other vegetation classes in a
   highly cleared and productive agricultural landscape in north-west New
   South Wales (NSW), Australia.
   Methods. Initially, we recorded activity in paddocks before plantation
   establishment, and then four to six years after establishment. We
   compared activity within young eucalypt plantations with surrounding
   paddocks and remnant woodland. We also radio-tracked four different bat
   species to investigate how roosting and foraging was apportioned into
   different habitats.
   Key results. The ultrasonic survey of bats found that the young
   plantations were typically used by 7-8 species and activity averaged 87
   passes per night. Activity within plantations was similar to treeless
   paddocks, and approximately six times less than in small remnants. The
   very high activity levels and feeding buzzes in small remnants was
   significantly related to rich, basalt soil (which was used as a proxy
   for invertebrate biomass) on agricultural plains. Total activity and
   species richness was correlated positively with the number of remnant
   trees on the site, but neither plantation area nor shape influenced bat
   activity. Plantations were not used preferentially by radio-tracked bats
   at night compared with their availability in the local landscape
   (13-14\% bat use, 17\% available). No bat roosts were located within the
   plantations. Most bat roosts were in tree hollows, which were absent in
   the plantations. Decorticating bark was abundant in eucalypt
   plantations, but only Nyctophilus geoffroyi was observed beneath bark
   and only in remnant trees outside of plantations.
   Conclusions. Young eucalypt plantations have limited value for bats, and
   this is comparable to previous studies on more environmentally focussed
   plantings.
   Implications. The value of plantations for bats would be improved by
   retaining remnant trees, both in the surrounding landscape and within
   plantations. We also recommend varying tree densities to increase the
   diversity of animal species using plantations.}},

Abstract = {{Fire management will face many challenges in the future from global

   Simulation modeling will be a vital tool for addressing these challenges

   mechanistic approaches to model novel climates. This chapter summarizes
   important issues that will be critical for wildland fire management in

   have in tackling these issues. The challenges of simulation modeling
   include: (i) spatial representation, (ii) uncertainty, (iii) complexity,
   (iv) parameterization, (v) initialization, (vi) testing and validation.
   The LANDFIRE project is presented as an example on how simulation
   modeling is used to support current fire management issues. Research and
   management needs for successful wildland fire-related simulation
   modeling projects will need (i) extensive mechanistic research programs,
   (ii) comprehensive databases, (iii) statistical validation methods and

Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{77-85}},

Abstract = {{1. A valuable technique in the study of insect movement is protein
   marking, a quantitative method where individuals are categorized as
   marked or unmarked based on the amount of foreign protein detected by an
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   2. Whether individuals are considered marked or not is dependent on a
   threshold value chosen by the experimenter. The traditional method of
   choosing the threshold accepts some risk of false positives, wherein
   unmarked individuals are misclassified as marked. The error rate
   associated with this method, adopted from the rubidium marking
   literature, relies on assumptions violated by most ELISA data.
   3. We critically examined the effect of violating these assumptions on
   the false positive rate. In long-distance dispersal studies where the
   ratio of unmarked to marked insects is high, false positives can
   seriously bias estimates of insect movement abilities.
   4. Simulations demonstrated that the conventional method for choosing a
   threshold (i) masks the presence of false positives, (ii) results in a
   10-fold higher than expected false positive rate, and (iii) relies on
   assumptions of normality that are rarely satisfied; non-normality
   produces further increases in false positive rates.
   5. We provide some solutions by introducing a new procedure for choosing
   a threshold that decreases the incidence of false positives and allows
   data to be corrected for anticipated rates of false positives. This
   methodology should enhance researcher confidence in the data generated
   from dispersal studies using protein marking techniques.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Several studies of U.S. National Forests suggest that declines of their
   associated forest products industries were driven by synergistic changes
   in federal governance and market conditions during the late 20th
   century. In Alaska, dramatic shifts in the economic and political
   settings of the Tongass National Forest (Tongass) drove changes in
   governance leading to collapse of an industrial forest management system
   in the early 1990s. However, 15 years since collapse, the reorganization
   of Tongass governance to reflect `new' economic and political realities
   has not progressed. To understand both the factors that hinder
   institutional change (inertia) and the factors that enable progress
   toward reorganization (adaptation), I analyzed how Tongass forest
   management, specifically timber sale planning, has responded to changes
   in market conditions, local industry structure, and larger-scale
   political governance. Inertia was evidenced by continued emphasis on
   even-aged management and large-scale harvesting, i.e., the retention of
   an industrial forestry philosophy that, in the current political
   situation, yields mostly litigation and appeals, and relatively few
   forest products. Adaptation was evidenced by flexibility in harvest
   methods, a willingness to meet local demand instead of political
   targets, and a growing degree of cooperation with environmental advocacy
   groups. New partnerships, markets, and political leaders at state and
   national levels can frame a new blueprint for reorganization of Tongass
   management toward a more sustainable future.}},

Abstract = {{Few conservation projects consider climate impacts or have a process for

   developing adaptation strategies with 20 projects from diverse
   geographies. Project teams assessed likely climate impacts using
   historical climate data, future climate predictions, expert input, and
   scientific literature. They then developed adaptation strategies that
   considered ecosystems and species of concern, project goals, climate
   impacts, and indicators of progress. Project teams identified 176 likely
   climate impacts and developed adaptation strategies to address 42 of
   these impacts. The most common impacts were to habitat quantity or
   quality, and to hydrologic regimes. Nearly half of expected impacts were
   temperature-mediated. Twelve projects indicated that the project focus,
   either focal ecosystems and species or project boundaries, need to
   change as a result of considering climate impacts. More than half of the
   adaptation strategies were resistance strategies aimed at preserving the
   status quo. The rest aimed to make ecosystems and species more resilient

   way, either by adding new actions, or by adjusting existing actions.
   Habitat restoration and enactment of policies and regulations were the
   most frequently prescribed, though every adaptation strategy required a

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{40-50}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the interaction between sediment supply and channel
   instability and implications of system-wide instability for stream
   restoration. Using examples from southwest Ohio, we show that recent
   channel instability is largely a consequence of reduced sediment supply
   over several past decades. The widths of the studied channels narrowed
   by a factor of three to four between the 1930s and 2000s, and channel
   beds have incised into glacial sediments. Lateral migration of these
   channels decreased after 1960, signaling the onset of channel incision.
   Soil loss rates in 2005 were 4 to 20 times lower than in the 1920s,
   mainly as a result of the shift from conventional to conservation
   tillage. The construction of impoundments has further reduced sediment
   delivery downstream, and climate change may exacerbate this imbalance by
   increasing sediment transport capacity including peak flows. Thus the
   decrease in sediment supply occurred during a time when peak stream
   flows have been increasing, resulting in an imbalance between sediment
   supply and sediment transporting power in the stream systems. Because
   sediment supply and transport are governed by watershed-scale
   conditions, channel instability will persist in this region for some
   time to come. Reach-scale restoration will neither improve water quality
   nor prevent continued system-wide channel instability We advocate an
   approach that uses setbacks/buffers that allow streams to develop new,
   dynamic floodplains with which to reestablish connections while
   selectively protecting significant sites with stabilization measures.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{277-357}},
Abstract = {{1. New patterns and trends in land use are becoming increasingly evident
   in Europe's heavily modified landscape and else whereas sustainable
   agriculture and nature restoration are developed as viable long-term
   alternatives to intensively farmed arable land. The success of these
   changes depends on how soil biodiversity and processes respond to
   changes in management. To improve our understanding of the community
   structure and ecosystem functioning of the soil biota, we analyzed
   abiotic variables across 200 sites, and biological variables across 170
   sites in The Netherlands, one of the most intensively farmed countries.
   The data were derived from the Dutch Soil Quality Network (DSQN), a
   long-term monitoring framework designed to obtain ecological insight
   into soil types (STs) and ecosystem types (ETs).
   2. At the outset we describe STs and biota, and we estimate the
   contribution of various groups to the provision of ecosystem services.
   We focused on interactive effects of soil properties on community
   patterns and ecosystem functioning using food web models. Ecologists
   analyze soil food webs by means of mechanistic and statistical
   modelling, linking network structure to energy flow and elemental
   dynamics commonly based on allometric scaling.
   3. We also explored how predatory and metabolic processes are
   constrained by body size, diet and metabolic type, and how these
   constraints govern the interactions within and between trophic groups.
   In particular, we focused on how elemental fluxes determine the
   strengths of ecological interactions, and the resulting ecosystem
   services, in terms of sustenance of soil fertility.
   4. We discuss data mining, food web visualizations, and an appropriate
   categorical way to capture subtle interrelationships within the DSQN
   dataset. Sampled metazoans were used to provide an overview of
   below-ground processes and influences of land use. Unlike most studies
   to date we used data from the entire size spectrum, across 15 orders of
   magnitude, using body size as a continuous trait crucial for
   understanding ecological services.
   5. Multimodality in the frequency distributions of body size represents
   a performance filter that acts as a buffer to environmental change.
   Large differences in the body-size distributions across ETs and STs were
   evident. Most observed trends support the hypothesis that the direct
   influence of ecological stoichiometry on the soil biota as an
   independent predictor (e.g. in the form of nutrient to carbon ratios),
   and consequently on the allometric scaling, is more dominant than either
   ET or ST. This provides opportunities to develop a mechanistic and
   physiologically oriented model for the distribution of species' body
   sizes, where responses of invertebrates can be predicted.
   6. Our results highlight the different roles that organisms play in a
   number of key ecosystem services. Such a trait-based research has unique
   strengths in its rigorous formulation of fundamental scaling rules, as
   well as in its verifiability by empirical data. Nonetheless, it still
   has weaknesses that remain to be addressed, like the consequences of
   intraspecific size variation, the high degree of omnivory, and a
   possibly inaccurate assignment to trophic groups.
   7. Studying the extent to which nutrient levels influence multitrophic
   interactions and how different land-use regimes affect soil biodiversity
   is clearly a fruitful area for future research to develop predictive
   models for soil ecosystem services under different management regimes.
   No similar efforts have been attempted previously for soil food webs,
   and our dataset has the potential to test and further verify its
   usefulness at an unprecedented space scale.}},

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{562-570}},
Abstract = {{Over the past decade, attempts have been made to characterise the
   factors affecting the robustness of food webs. Many studies have been
   carried out using a ``topological{''} approach, in which secondary
   extinctions in ecological networks are determined by the structure of
   the network alone. These studies have led to numerous insights; for
   example how robustness is highly dependent on the order of extinctions,
   the fraction of basal species, as well as the connectance of the webs.
   But there has been criticism of these investigations for their lack of
   biological realism, such as the inability of species to alter their
   diets when species are lost, or the reliance on the criterion that a
   species only suffers a secondary extinction once it loses all its
   resources. Here, building on past approaches, we address these issues by
   introducing allometric optimal foraging theory to explore the
   consequences of species adaptively responding (by altering feeding
   links) to loss of prey in size-structured food webs. We also explore the
   effect on robustness of a secondary extinction criterion based on a
   threshold of energy loss, rather than merely the absence of a connection
   to at least one prey. We show that both rewiring and energetic
   extinction criteria greatly affect the robustness of model food webs,
   and that these new factors interact with each other as well as with the
   body mass distribution of the community, to shape the complexity
   robustness relationship.}},

Title = {{How to link soil C pools with CO2 fluxes?}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1523-1537}},
Abstract = {{Despite the importance of carbon (C) pools and CO2 fluxes in terrestrial
   ecosystems and especially in soils, as well as many attempts to assign
   fluxes to specific pools, this challenge remains unsolved.
   Interestingly, scientists investigating pools are not closely linked
   with scientists studying fluxes. This review therefore focused on
   experimental approaches enabling soil C pools to be linked with CO2 flux
   from the soil. The background, advantages and shortcomings of uncoupled
   approaches (measuring only pools or fluxes) and of coupled approaches
   (measuring both pools and fluxes) were evaluated and their prerequisites
   - steady state of pools and isotopic steady state - described. The
   uncoupled approaches include: (i) monitoring the decrease of C pools in
   long-term fallow bare soil lacking C input over decades, (ii) analyzing
   components of CO2 efflux dynamics by incubating soil without new C input
   over months or years, and (iii) analyzing turnover rates of C pools
   based on their C-13 and C-14 isotopic signature. The uncoupled
   approaches are applicable for non-steady state conditions only and have
   limited explanatory power. The more advantageous coupled approaches
   partition simultaneously pools and fluxes based on one of three types of
   changes in the isotopic signature of input C compared to soil C: (i)
   abrupt permanent, (ii) gradual permanent, and (iii) abrupt temporary
   impacts. I show how the maximal sensitivity of the approaches depends on
   the differences in the isotopic signature of pools with fast and slow
   turnover rates. The promising coupled approaches include: (a) delta C-13
   of C pools and CO2 efflux from soil after C-3/C-4 vegetation changes or
   in FACE experiments (both corresponding to continuous labeling), (b)
   addition of C-13 or C-14 labeled organics (corresponding to pulse
   labeling), and (c) bomb-C-14. I show that physical separation of soil C
   pools is not a prerequisite to estimate pool size or to link pools with
   fluxes. Based on simple simulation of C aging in soil after the input,
   the discordance of MRT of C in pools and of C released in CO2 was
   demonstrated. This discordance of MRT between pools and fluxes shows
   that the use of MRT of pools alone underestimates the fluxes at least
   for two times. The future challenges include combining two or more
   promising approaches to elucidate more than two C sources for CO2

Title = {{Towards accounting for dissolved iron speciation in global ocean models}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3025-3039}},
Abstract = {{The trace metal iron (Fe) is now routinely included in state-of-the-art
   ocean general circulation and biogeochemistry models (OGCBMs) because of
   its key role as a limiting nutrient in regions of the world ocean
   important for carbon cycling and air-sea CO2 exchange. However, the
   complexities of the seawater Fe cycle, which impact its speciation and
   bioavailability, are simplified in such OGCBMs due to gaps in
   understanding and to avoid high computational costs. In a similar
   fashion to inorganic carbon speciation, we outline a means by which the
   complex speciation of Fe can be included in global OGCBMs in a
   reasonably cost-effective manner. We construct an Fe speciation model
   based on hypothesised relationships between rate constants and
   environmental variables (temperature, light, oxygen, pH, salinity) and
   assumptions regarding the binding strengths of Fe complexing organic
   ligands and test hypotheses regarding their distributions. As a result,
   we find that the global distribution of different Fe species is tightly
   controlled by spatio-temporal environmental variability and the
   distribution of Fe binding ligands. Impacts on bioavailable Fe are
   highly sensitive to assumptions regarding which Fe species are
   bioavailable and how those species vary in space and time. When forced
   by representations of future ocean circulation and climate we find large
   changes to the speciation of Fe governed by pH mediated changes to redox
   kinetics. We speculate that these changes may exert selective pressure
   on phytoplankton Fe uptake strategies in the future ocean. In future
   work, more information on the sources and sinks of ocean Fe ligands,
   their bioavailability, the cycling of colloidal Fe species and kinetics
   of Fe-surface coordination reactions would be invaluable. We hope our
   modeling approach can provide a means by which new observations of Fe
   speciation can be tested against hypotheses of the processes present in
   governing the ocean Fe cycle in an integrated sense}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{3457-3489}},
Abstract = {{The terrestrial carbon (C) cycle has received increasing interest over
   the past few decades, however, there is still a lack of understanding of
   the fate of newly assimilated C allocated within plants and to the soil,
   stored within ecosystems and lost to the atmosphere. Stable carbon
   isotope studies can give novel insights into these issues. In this
   review we provide an overview of an emerging picture of
   plant-soil-atmosphere C fluxes, as based on C isotope studies, and
   identify processes determining related C isotope signatures. The first
   part of the review focuses on isotopic fractionation processes within
   plants during and after photosynthesis. The second major part elaborates
   on plant-internal and plant-rhizosphere C allocation patterns at
   different time scales (diel, seasonal, interannual), including the speed
   of C transfer and time lags in the coupling of assimilation and
   respiration, as well as the magnitude and controls of plant-soil C
   allocation and respiratory fluxes. Plant responses to changing
   environmental conditions, the functional relationship between the
   physiological and phenological status of plants and C transfer, and
   interactions between C, water and nutrient dynamics are discussed. The
   role of the C counterflow from the rhizosphere to the aboveground parts
   of the plants, e. g. via CO2 dissolved in the xylem water or as
   xylem-transported sugars, is highlighted. The third part is centered
   around belowground C turnover, focusing especially on above-and
   belowground litter inputs, soil organic matter formation and turnover,
   production and loss of dissolved organic C, soil respiration and CO2
   fixation by soil microbes. Furthermore, plant controls on microbial
   communities and activity via exudates and litter production as well as
   microbial community effects on C mineralization are reviewed. A further
   part of the paper is dedicated to physical interactions between soil CO2
   and the soil matrix, such as CO2 diffusion and dissolution processes
   within the soil profile. Finally, we highlight state-of-the-art stable
   isotope methodologies and their latest developments. From the presented
   evidence we conclude that there exists a tight coupling of physical,
   chemical and biological processes involved in C cycling and C isotope
   fluxes in the plant-soil-atmosphere system. Generally, research using
   information from C isotopes allows an integrated view of the different
   processes involved. However, complex interactions among the range of
   processes complicate or currently impede the interpretation of isotopic
   signals in CO2 or organic compounds at the plant and ecosystem level.
   This review tries to identify present knowledge gaps in correctly
   interpreting carbon stable isotope signals in the plant-soil-atmosphere
   system and how future research approaches could contribute to closing
   these gaps.}},

Abstract = {{The 2007 amendments to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity
   Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) commenced on 19 February 2007. These
   amendments provide, among other things, greater flexibility in the
   assessment and referral process, establish a new process for listing
   threatened species, ecological communities and key threatening
   processes, and enhance the EPBC Act's compliance and enforcement regime.
   Of particular relevance to the Australasian Bat Society are the new
   procedures that relate to the listing and recovery of threatened species
   and ecological communities. New procedures include the formulation of a
   prioritisation list for nominations, the possible adoption by the
   Minister of a conservation theme for new nominations and the
   establishment of an annual assessment cycle. The new process is designed
   to improve the effectiveness of listing with a more strategic approach
   focussing on those species in greatest need of protection.
   The amendments change the focus from recovery plans to recovery
   `action', primarily through ensuring that there is approved conservation
   advice at all times for each listed threatened species and ecological
   community. The Minister can decide whether a recovery plan is required
   for a threatened species or ecological community or whether to
   discontinue use of an existing plan. The Minister can also decide the
   type of plan (eg. single species, multi species, regional).
   The changes to the EPBC Act will ensure that matters protected by the
   Act continue to receive the highest possible level of protection.
   Implementation of these changes will cut unproductive `red tape' and
   enable quicker and more strategic action to be taken on emerging

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{182-189}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   Species loss has increased significantly over the last 1000 years and is
   ultimately attributed to the direct and indirect consequences of
   increased human population growth across the planet. A growing number of
   species are becoming endangered and require human intervention to
   prevent their local extirpation or complete extinction. Management
   strategies aimed at mitigating a species loss can benefit greatly from
   empirical approaches that indicate the rate of decline of a species
   providing objective information on the need for immediate conservation
   actions, e.g. captive breeding; however, this is rarely employed. The
   current study used a novel method to examine the distributional trends
   of a model endangered species, the freshwater pearl mussel,
   Margaritifera margaritifera (L.).
   Location
   United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.
   Methods
   Using species presence data within 10-km grid squares since records
   began three-parameter logistic regression curves were fitted to
   extrapolate an estimated date of regional extinction.
   Results
   This study has shown that freshwater pearl mussel distribution has
   contracted since known historical records and outlier populations were
   lost first. Within the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland,
   distribution loss has been greatest in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales
   and England, respectively, with the Republic of Ireland containing the
   highest relative proportion of M. margaritifera distribution, in 1998.
   Main conclusions
   This study provides empirical evidence that this species could become
   extinct throughout countries within the United Kingdom within 170 years
   under the current trends and emphasizes that regionally specific
   management strategies need to be implemented to prevent extirpation of
   this species.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the mainstream, resource economics, and ecological
   economics models of growth. A possible synthesis of energy-based and
   mainstream models is presented. This shows that when energy is scarce it
   imposes a strong constraint on the growth of the economy; however, when
   energy is abundant, its effect on economic growth is much reduced. The
   industrial revolution released the constraints on economic growth by the
   development of new methods of using coal and the discovery of new fossil
   fuel resources. Time-series analysis shows that energy and GDP
   cointegrate, and energy use Granger causes GDP when capital and other
   production inputs are included in the vector autoregression model.
   However, various mechanisms can weaken the links between energy and
   growth. Energy used per unit of economic output has declined in
   developed and some developing countries, owing to both technological
   change and a shift from poorer quality fuels, such as coal, to the use
   of higher quality fuels, especially electricity. Substitution of other
   inputs for energy and sectoral shifts in economic activity play smaller

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The conflict between the conservation of biodiversity and recreation
   activities in the European landscape is intensifying. Managers of large
   nature areas are confronted with increasing numbers of visitors and
   decreasing biodiversity values. To accommodate the visitors while
   simultaneously protecting the biodiversity values they need to make
   changes in the landscape. Current legislation, a lack of knowledge on
   the recreation-biodiversity relationship, and the diverging point of
   view of stakeholders make it difficult to find consensual solutions. New
   approaches such as adaptive management and boundary management can help
   managers and stakeholders in the process of decision making. In these
   approaches the role of scientists has changed, as has the use of their
   tools. Using two research projects in Europe we explore how scientific
   tools are used in this new context. We argue that such tools (1) should
   be built on the interactions between recreation and biodiversity
   functions, (2) can be used interactively to encourage stakeholders to
   engage in a learning process, (3) allow local knowledge and data to be
   incorporated into them, and (4) generate output in the form of a map
   showing where the conflict areas and opportunities are located. These
   four key features will help managers to improve communication between
   themselves, stakeholders, and scientists, increase consensus between
   stakeholders on how the conflict should be perceived, explore solutions,
   and generate new knowledge. For future research we suggest investigating
   how adaptive management and boundary management can be used in a
   stepwise learning strategy and how uncertainties in the tools affect the
   learning process.}},

Title = {{Exploring Resilience and Transformability of a River Basin in the Face

   River Basin, Central Asia}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Water from the Amudarya River is a vital and strategic resource for
   semi-arid Uzbekistan because of its heavy reliance on irrigated
   agriculture. The Uzbek water management regime, however, has proven to
   be rather reluctant to adapt to changing environmental and
   socio-political conditions despite recent massive pressures caused by
   political, environmental, or donor-induced developments in the region.
   The aim of this paper is to explore reasons for the low adaptability of
   the Uzbek water sector and assess implications for the resilience of the
   Uzbek social-ecological system (SES). By analyzing past losses of
   resilience as well as first attempts at institutional change in land and
   water management, we identify drivers as well as structural factors and
   mechanisms that act as barriers for adaptation and transformation
   towards a more sustainable system. With the collapse of the Aral Sea
   fisheries and the basin-wide large scale soil salinization, the SES in
   the Amudarya River Basin has shifted to a new, less desirable regime.
   However, the high resilience of the social system is keeping it in its
   current undesirable state and further degrades its long-term resilience.
   Our analysis identifies reinforcing feedbacks caused by ecological
   dynamics, vested interests, and a patronage system that contribute to
   the resistance to change and keep the system locked in its current
   unsustainable state. These factors are rooted in the history of the SES
   in the river basin, such as the economic dependence on cotton and the
   state-centered management approach. The window of opportunity for
   significant changes of the larger scale institutional setting that might
   have been open after the breakup of the Soviet Union was or could not be
   used to achieve a transformation to more sustainable resources use.
   Measures aimed at an incremental improvement of the current situation
   are not sufficient to prevent further losses of resilience. Resilience
   and transformability of the larger scale SES (political, economic, and
   institutional settings) are needed to enable the smaller scales
   (regional and local water management) to adapt and change. However, we
   identified opportunities for change arising from the slow acceptance of
   bottom-up management institutions in the water sector and from the
   extensive restoration capacity of the ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Ecosystem Services Linking Social and Ecological Systems: River
   Brownification and the Response of Downstream Stakeholders}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The theoretical framework of ecosystem services and that of resilience
   thinking are combined in an empirical case study of a social-ecological
   system. In the River Helge a catchment in southern Sweden, a slow
   increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) results in brownification of
   the water with consequences on ecosystem services in the lower part of
   the catchment of concern by local resource managers. An assessment of
   ecosystem service delivery was conducted to (1) identify plausible
   drivers of brownification in the study site and assess future ecosystem
   service delivery for stakeholders in downstream areas. An analysis of
   the perspective of beneficiaries, using qualitative methods, was pursued
   to (2) evaluate the impacts of brownification on downstream
   stakeholders.
   Our analyses of drivers of brownification in combination with climate
   change projections suggests that Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere
   Reserve will experience extreme water flows much more frequently than
   the system is accustomed to today, and that these water flows will be
   highly affected by brownification. The combination of severe summer
   flooding and high water color constituted a new disturbance regime and
   thus requires new adaptive strategies by local stakeholders. A range of
   coping and adaptation strategies were displayed by the farmers but also
   a possible transformation strategy, i.e., abandonment of the seasonally
   flooded meadows. Because hay making and grazing are central components
   in the active management of the Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere
   Reserve, to discontinue this practice would have system-wide
   ramifications for the Biosphere Reserve. The vulnerability of fishing in
   the culturally significant ``Eel Coast,{''} part of the downstream area,
   was also exposed.
   We argue that for environmental monitoring of slow changing variables to
   make sense to local stakeholders, clear links to ecosystem service
   benefits are required. The responsibility for this and thus for matching
   of social and ecological scales falls heavily on regional managers. We
   further argue that resilience of a social-ecological system can be
   estimated by observing and analyzing how local stakeholders respond to
   disturbances, i.e., by analyzing their response strategies.}},

   Mediterranean basin, where important future climatic changes are
   expected. Here, we assess and compare two commonly used modeling
   approaches (niche- and process-based models) to project the future of
   current stands of three forest species with contrasting distributions,
   using regionalized climate for continental Spain. Results highlight
   variability in model ability to estimate current distributions, and the
   inherent large uncertainty involved in making projections into the
   future. CO2 fertilization through projected increased atmospheric CO2
   concentrations is shown to increase forest productivity in the
   mechanistic process-based model (despite increased drought stress) by up
   to three times that of the non-CO2 fertilization scenario by the period
   2050-2080, which is in stark contrast to projections of reduced habitat
   suitability from the niche-based models by the same period. This
   highlights the importance of introducing aspects of plant
   biogeochemistry into current niche-based models for a realistic
   projection of future species distributions. We conclude that the future

   ecological basis of the management of principal land-use practices
   (forests, rangelands, nature reserves) in Mediterranean Israel, and
   advocated ecological thinking to achieve better management and to
   minimize inter-agency conflicts. We propose a broader framework for
   integrated management of multiple uses by adoption of a landscape
   perspective that cuts across administrative lines. The reasoning for
   taking such an approach is based on the newly developing understanding
   of the impact of dynamic processes that occur spontaneously on a large
   scale in Mediterranean Israel. Landscape-scale interactions-oak woodland
   succession and pine colonization-may interfere or even conflict with
   some management goals set by the agencies involved. Attempts to mitigate
   these interactions may be very costly or ineffective. We propose
   coordinated management, planning, and implementation, based on common
   ecological criteria. We base this paper on observations and on
   perceptions gained from analyzing landscape dynamics of the predominant
   ecosystems in Mediterranean Israel: dense oak woodland and planted pine
   forests. The small size of Israel and the consequently small size of
   different land-use units, as well as their close proximity to each
   other, call for coordination of the organizational perspectives that
   relate at present independently to the various units. The new
   perspective should be broader, regional, landscape-oriented, and should
   take into consideration ecological processes that integrate neighboring
   units. As a first step, all agencies involved should accept the pine-oak
   interaction and dynamics as part of the local succession and should
   adapt their management schemes accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Recent climate change has affected a wide range of species, but
   predicting population responses to projected climate change using
   population dynamics theory and models remains challenging, and very few
   attempts have been made. The Southern Ocean sea surface temperature and
   sea ice extent are projected to warm and shrink as concentrations of
   atmospheric greenhouse gases increase, and several top predator species
   are affected by fluctuations in these oceanographic variables.
   2. We compared and projected the population responses of three seabird
   species living in sub-tropical, sub-Antarctic and Antarctic biomes to
   predicted climate change over the next 50 years. Using stochastic
   population models we combined long-term demographic datasets and
   projections of sea surface temperature and sea ice extent for three
   different IPCC emission scenarios (from most to least severe: A1B, A2,
   B1) from general circulation models of Earth's climate.
   3. We found that climate mostly affected the probability to breed
   successfully, and in one case adult survival. Interestingly, frequent
   nonlinear relationships in demographic responses to climate were
   detected. Models forced by future predicted climatic change provided
   contrasted population responses depending on the species considered. The
   northernmost distributed species was predicted to be little affected by
   a future warming of the Southern Ocean, whereas steep declines were
   projected for the more southerly distributed species due to sea surface
   temperature warming and decrease in sea ice extent. For the most
   southerly distributed species, the A1B and B1 emission scenarios were
   respectively the most and less damaging. For the two other species,
   population responses were similar for all emission scenarios.
   4. This is among the first attempts to study the demographic responses
   for several populations with contrasted environmental conditions, which
   illustrates that investigating the effects of climate change on core
   population dynamics is feasible for different populations using a common
   methodological framework. Our approach was limited to single populations
   and have neglected population settlement in new favourable habitats or
   changes in inter-specific relations as a potential response to future
   climate change. Predictions may be enhanced by merging demographic
   population models and climatic envelope models.}},

Pages = {{1-11}},
Abstract = {{Benthic foraminifera (protists) have long been recognized as sensitive
   indicators in studies on natural and human-induced environmental,
   paleo-environmental, and climate change. These wide-ranging applications
   are founded on more than a century of field-based investigations in
   which environmental data were related to species distributions, and have
   subsequently been refined by the development of chemical proxies and a
   variety of culture-based studies. The recent discovery of foraminiferal
   propagule banks that occur in the fine-sediment fraction of marine
   depositional settings provides a novel experimental tool for examining
   the ecology of benthic foraminifera, their processes of dispersal, and
   the responses of multi-species assemblages to changing environmental
   conditions. In the `propagule method' presented here, we use
   experimental arrays in which foraminifera are grown from propagule banks
   under different controlled abiotic conditions. We examined the roles of
   temperature, salinity, and site (exposed vs. protected) in structuring
   coastal assemblages and show that, because individual species respond
   differently, distinct assemblages grew from the same propagule bank
   under different environmental regimes. Temperature was the most
   important factor distinguishing experimental assemblages, whereas
   exposure of the collection site (e.g. to waves and currents, that
   promote or limit species dispersal to and from each site) was most
   important in determining species richness. The diversity of the
   propagule bank therefore imparts resilience to foraminiferal
   associations and provides a rapid-response mechanism for changing
   environments. This method further provides a tool for documenting
   changes in coastal assemblages that potentially result from warming or
   cooling climates.}},

   MODELLING FOR STUDENTS, TEACHERS \& SCIENTISTS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Pages = {{55-66}},
Abstract = {{We describe the fundamentals and applications of trophic models of
   ecological systems and show how a simple mass balance approach of the
   early 1980s was further developed into a very advanced complex software
   package, freely available on the internet (Ecopath with Ecosim, EwE,
   http://www.ecopath.org). Through its three decades of evolution, the
   approach became increasingly popular, with over three hundred Ecopath
   models being published to date. During its first 10-15 years, the
   approach was mainly used as a tool to integrate ecological and fisheries
   data to understand and visualize the trophic flow structure of
   ecosystems, thereby allowing for the meaningful comparisons between
   systems. Later (since the mid-1990s) it was increasingly used to explore
   ecosystem changes under the impact of management or climate impact
   scenarios. This evolution from a more descriptive mass-balance to a
   simulation modelling tool was enabled through fundamental changes in the
   mathematical architecture: the original version of Ecopath was based on
   linear algebra for input output analysis to investigate the properties
   of steady state networks, while in the recent version, coupled
   differential equations are used for each of the defined system
   compartments. The new model architecture thus allows the magnitude of
   flows in and out of compartments to change over time, which makes
   simulations of changes possible. Foraging arena theory was also taken
   into account and prey biomass was allowed to vary in its availability
   (vulnerability) to predators. If the predators consumption is mainly
   determined by prey availability (bottom-up control, low vulnerability),
   predator biomass would greatly respond to changes in prey biomass, while
   under a situation of strong predator (top-down) control, changes in
   predator biomass would greatly impact its prey (high vulnerability).
   Since EwE also allows for specifying different resource use types (e.g.
   types of fisheries or other resource uses) and economic variables
   associated to them (operational costs, number of people employed etc.),
   different management regimes can also be explored in terms of their
   socio-economic outcome. If spatially explicit data on biomass
   distribution of model groups and dispersal rate values are available,
   the Ecospace module of the EwE package may be used to derive at a
   spatially explicit, dynamic trophic model able to simulate how the
   management of one part of the system area may affect other parts. The
   incorporation of these spatial dynamics is of particular interest in the
   exploration of management questions, such as in the size and placement
   of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (this application is not further
   described in this chapter).}},

Abstract = {{This Perspective examines progress, challenges and emerging directions

   toolkit which is widely used to examine the biodiversity response to

   modelling has been the subject of intense research in statistical

   statistical foundation towards a framework that increasingly
   incorporates the ecological detail of a species' climatic sensitivity.
   However, as models become more complex (with greater ecological realism)
   a choice emerges between two approaches: (i) greater model complexity
   and biological realism - especially where applied to specific
   conservation problems; and (ii) acceptance of simple bioclimatic tools
   as a useful albeit limited component, within a mixed evidence-base to
   assess climate change threat and conservation action. I conclude that
   whole-organism biologists working at museums and botanic gardens should
   claim an increasing stake in the bioclimatic framework, especially as
   the field develops towards an improved biology, towards the integration

Pages = {{664-671}},
Abstract = {{Context. While much attention has been paid to the effects of global
   temperature increases on the geographical ranges and phenologies of
   plants and animals, less is known about the impacts of climatically
   driven alteration of water regimes.
   Aims. To assess how three species of freshwater turtle in Australia's
   Murray-Darling Basin have responded to long-term decline in river flow
   and floodplain inundation due to climatic drying and water diversions.
   Methods. Turtle populations were sampled in a section of the Murray
   River and its floodplain in 1976-82 following a wet period and in
   2009-11 at the end of the most severe drought on record. Catch per unit
   effort, proportional abundance in different habitat types and population
   structure were assessed in both periods.
   Key results. Catch per unit effort in baited hoop nets declined by 91\%
   for the eastern snake-necked turtle (Chelodina longicollis) and 69\% for
   the Murray turtle (Emydura macquarii), but did not change significantly
   for the broad-shelled turtle (Chelodina expansa). In addition, total
   catches from a range of sampling methods revealed a significantly
   reduced proportion of juvenile C. longicollis and E. macquarii in
   2009-11, suggesting a fall in recruitment.
   Key conclusions. The decline of C. longicollis was likely due mainly to
   drought-induced loss of critical floodplain habitat in the form of
   temporary water bodies, and that of E. macquarii to combined effects of
   drought and predation on recruitment. C. expansa seems to have fared
   better than the other two species because it is less vulnerable to nest
   predation than E. macquarii and better able than C. longicollis to find
   adequate nutrition in the permanent waters that remain during extended
   drought.
   Implications. Declining water availability may be a widespread threat to
   freshwater turtles given predicted global impacts of climate change and
   water withdrawals on river flows. Understanding how each species uses
   particular habitats and how climatic and non-climatic threats interact
   would facilitate identification of vulnerable populations and planning
   of conservation actions.}},

Abstract = {{The process of recreating historical land cover dynamics, needed to
   understand trends and transient states in ecosystems, includes
   difficulties such as the sensitivity of applied spatial analyses to
   heterogeneities in historical material. This paper compares the handling
   of quantitatively dominating categories in two matrix analyses of land
   cover change within a Swedish boreal landscape (1725-1859). The focus is
   on how inconsistencies between historical maps can be handled without
   violating the inherent semantic potential. The study shows that analyses
   of land cover support different indications of change depending on the
   treatment of dominating categories. The type of landscape and research
   questions in focus should therefore be part of choosing matrix method
   and classification scheme. The observed patterns need to be evaluated
   against drivers of change and semantic plasticity in classification
   schemes to separate ecological change from semantic confusion. This
   paper recommends aggregated classification schemes with maintained
   original relationships between categories in comprehensive analyses.
   However, no pathway is persistent over time and categories should be
   allowed to disappear and new to appear. Analysis of historical dynamics
   with extended transition matrixes is recommended to account for the
   dynamics of small categories in relation to dominating categories within

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparative study of two different drainage
   designs in a 10,930-ha new town development of The Woodlands, Texas.
   Open surface drainage by shallow grassed swales was used in the first
   two subdivisions that were developed with ecological approaches. Open
   surface drainage mimics the natural flow regime and is regarded to
   mitigate development impacts on watershed. In other later subdivisions,
   the drainage design shifted back to a conventional stormwater drainage
   system, that is. curb and gutter, drop inlet, and underground piping,
   known to concentrate stormwater and lead to downstream flooding. The
   objective of this study is to compare The Woodlands' two drainage
   systems on their correlation with downstream floods. Two sub-watersheds
   within The Woodlands that used different drainage designs were compared.
   U.S. Geological Survey stream data from the gauge station at the outlet
   of each sub-watershed were used for analysis. Geographic Information
   System was used to quantify the development conditions. Correlation
   analysis was performed using measured precipitation and streamflow data.
   Results show that open drainage watershed generated less storm runoff
   than the conventional drainage watershed, given the similar impervious
   area in both watersheds. Furthermore, the open surface drainage
   watershed responded to rainfall in a way similar to its predevelopment
   natural forest conditions, indicating effective flood mitigation post
   development. In contrast, in the conventional drainage watershed, the
   precipitation-streamflow correlations increased enormously after
   development. The open drainage system presents an advantage over the
   conventional drainage one in mitigating flood problems in urban

Abstract = {{Aim
   We tested whether the contraction of the equatorward boundary of an

   Location
   The Atlantic coast of the United States.
   Methods
   Field transplant experiments were conducted at three locations along the
   US Atlantic coast. Survival and heat shock protein 70 expression were
   determined at biweekly intervals. Air and water temperature profiles
   were used to model current and historical patterns of mortality, and to
   determine rates of temperature change.
   Results
   High levels of mortality and expression of the inducible heat shock
   protein 70 were observed after multiple consecutive aerial exposures of
   32 degrees C or greater. Since 1960, seasonal air and water temperatures
   have increased along the eastern US seaboard, and south of Lewes, DE
   (38.8 degrees N) summer sea surface temperature increases have exceeded
   the upper lethal limits of this organism.
   Main conclusions
   Along the southern portion of its range, intertidal populations of M.
   edulis have experienced catastrophic mortality directly associated with
   summer high temperatures. Over the past 50 years, a geographic
   contraction of the southern, equatorward range edge of M. edulis has
   occurred, shifting the range edge approximately 350 km north of the
   previous limit at Cape Hatteras, NC (35.2 degrees N).}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is likely to increase the frequency of flood events, thus

   Identifying relations between stream ecological condition and urban

   landscape metrics which are functionally linked to indicators of stream

   that exacerbate or mitigate changes in ecological condition over and
   above impervious surface. The approach used addresses challenges
   associated with redundancy of landscape metrics, and links landscape
   pattern and composition to an indicator of stream ecological condition
   across a broad area of the eastern United States. Macroinvertebrate
   samples were collected during 2000-2001 from forty-two sites in the

   assemblage tolerance, and with urban-related chemical characteristics
   such as chloride concentration and an index of potential pesticide
   toxicity. Impervious surface explained 56\% of the variation in biotic
   score, but the variation explained increased to as high as 83\% with the
   incorporation of a second land use, cover, or configuration metric at

Abstract = {{1. Species are shifting their ranges at an unprecedented rate through
   human transportation and environmental change. Correlative species
   distribution models (SDMs) are frequently applied for predicting
   potential future distributions of range-shifting species, despite these
   models' assumptions that species are at equilibrium with the
   environments used to train (fit) the models, and that the training data
   are representative of conditions to which the models are predicted. Here
   we explore modelling approaches that aim to minimize extrapolation
   errors and assess predictions against prior biological knowledge. Our
   aim was to promote methods appropriate to range-shifting species.
   2. We use an invasive species, the cane toad in Australia, as an
   example, predicting potential distributions under both current and
   climate change scenarios. We use four SDM methods, and trial weighting
   schemes and choice of background samples appropriate for species in a
   state of spread. We also test two methods for including information from
   a mechanistic model. Throughout, we explore graphical techniques for
   understanding model behaviour and reliability, including the extent of
   extrapolation.
   3. Predictions varied with modelling method and data treatment,
   particularly with regard to the use and treatment of absence data.
   Models that performed similarly under current climatic conditions
   deviated widely when transferred to a novel climatic scenario.
   4. The results highlight problems with using SDMs for extrapolation, and
   demonstrate the need for methods and tools to understand models and
   predictions. We have made progress in this direction and have
   implemented exploratory techniques as new options in the free modelling
   software, MAXENT. Our results also show that deliberately controlling
   the fit of models and integrating information from mechanistic models
   can enhance the reliability of correlative predictions of species in
   non-equilibrium and novel settings.
   5. Implications. The biodiversity of many regions in the world is
   experiencing novel threats created by species invasions and climate
   change. Predictions of future species distributions are required for
   management, but there are acknowledged problems with many current
   methods, and relatively few advances in techniques for understanding or
   overcoming these. The methods presented in this manuscript and made
   accessible in MAXENT provide a forward step.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of evidence that ecologically important traits often

   is partially due to the high dimensionality of models that include both
   evolutionary and ecological dynamics. Here we show how the theory of
   fast-slow dynamical systems can be used to reduce model dimension, and
   we use that body of theory to study a general predator-prey system
   exhibiting fast evolution in either the predator or the prey. Our
   approach yields graphical methods with predictive power about when new
   and unique dynamics (e. g., completely out-of-phase oscillations and
   cryptic dynamics) can arise in ecological systems exhibiting fast
   evolution. In addition, we derive analytical expressions for determining
   when such behavior arises and how evolution affects qualitative
   properties of the ecological dynamics. Finally, while the theory
   requires a separation of timescales between the ecological and

   the rates of those processes are comparable and thus is a step toward

Abstract = {{One of the most efficient approaches for designing protected area (PA)
   networks is to use systematic conservation planning software. A number
   of software packages are available and all of them include a spatial
   cost or constraint component in their prioritisation algorithms, which
   allow the user to determine the level of fragmentation of the final PA
   system. Many conservation planners want to set minimum PA size
   thresholds, as small PAs are less viable and more expensive to manage,
   but this can only be achieved with existing software packages by
   repeatedly reducing the fragmentation levels of the PA system until
   every PA meets the threshold. Such an approach is inefficient because it
   increases the size of every PA, not just the smaller ones. Here we
   describe MinPatch, a software package developed to overcome this problem
   by manipulating outputs from the Marxan conservation planning software,
   so that every PA meets the user-defined size threshold. We then
   investigate the impacts of this approach with a dataset from the
   Maputaland Centre of Endemism, and find that using MinPatch to meet the
   PA thresholds is a much more efficient approach than using Marxan alone.
   We also show that setting a minimum PA threshold can have important
   effects on where new PAs are located when compared with Marxan outputs.
   Based on these results, we recommend that conservation planners use
   MinPatch whenever they want each PA in a network to meet a minimum size
   threshold. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   To reconstruct the Late Glacial and Holocene vegetation history of
   western Tasmania and to test the long-held notion of a replacement of
   forest by moorland during the mid to late Holocene in western Tasmania,
   Australia.
   Location
   Western Tasmania, Australia.
   Methods
   Fossil pollen data were screened with a modern pollen dataset using
   detrended correspondence analysis and charcoal data were analysed using
   significance tests.
   Results
   At the landscape scale, the distribution of vegetation types in western
   Tasmania has remained remarkably stable through the post-glacial period.
   Open moorland has dominated the landscape since the Late Glacial, while
   rain forest expanded at that time in to areas which it occupies today.
   Vegetation development in the Holocene is markedly different and
   charcoal values are significantly higher when compared with those in
   previous interglacial periods.
   Main conclusions
   The dominant paradigm of a replacement of rain forest by moorland across
   western Tasmania during the mid to late Holocene is not supported by
   this regional analysis. The arrival of humans in Tasmania during the
   Last Glacial Stage provided an ignition source that was independent of
   climate, and burning by humans through the Late Glacial period deflected
   vegetation development and facilitated the establishment of open
   moorland in regions occupied by rain forest during previous interglacial
   periods. It is concluded that the present dominance of the landscape of
   western Tasmania by open moorland is the direct result of human activity
   during the Late Glacial and that this region represents an ancient
   cultural landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Translocation, the intentional movement of living organisms from one
   area to another is increasingly being used as a conservation tool to
   overcome barriers to dispersal. A dichotomy exists for
   conservation-oriented translocations: on one hand, there are those that
   release plants or animals into known historic ranges and on the other
   hand, there are releases outside historic distributions. Misuse of or
   attempts to redefine established terms and a proliferation of variants
   of new terms such as assisted colonization, confuse and hamper
   communication. The aim of this opinion article is to describe and define
   a conservation translocation spectrum, from species reintroductions to
   assisted colonization, and beyond, and in so doing provide a standard
   framework and terminology for discussing translocation options. I
   suggest that we are moving along this spectrum, away from the dictates
   of historical species distribution records, toward the inclusion of more
   risky interventions that will be required to respond to habitat shifts
   due to anthropogenic impacts. To some extent rapid climate change
   changes everything, including how we should view introductions versus
   reintroductions. We need to seriously consider adding other approaches
   to our conservation toolbox. Assisted colonization will start us along
   this path, acknowledging as it does the accelerated rate of habitat
   change and the problems of attempting to preserve dynamic systems. The
   next step along the conservation translocation spectrum may be for
   reintroduction biology and restoration ecology to more comprehensively
   join forces on carefully selected projects to use species introductions

Title = {{Population Dynamics of Spotted Owls in the Sierra Nevada, California}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{174}},
Pages = {{1-36}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is the only
   spotted owl subspecies not listed as threatened or endangered under the
   United States Endangered Species Act despite petitions to list it as
   threatened. We conducted a meta-analysis of population data for 4
   populations in the southern Cascades and Sierra Nevada, California, USA,
   from 1990 to 2005 to assist a listing evaluation by the United States
   Fish and Wildlife Service. Our study areas (from N to S) were on the
   Lassen National Forest (LAS), Eldorado National Forest (ELD), Sierra
   National Forest (SIE), and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks
   (SKC). These study areas represented a broad spectrum of habitat and
   management conditions in these mountain ranges.
   We estimated apparent survival probability, reproductive output, and
   rate of population change for spotted owls on individual study areas and
   for all study areas combined (meta-analysis) using model selection or
   model-averaging based on maximum-likelihood estimation. We followed a
   formal protocol to conduct this analysis that was similar to other
   spotted owl meta-analyses. Consistency of field and analytical methods
   among our studies reduced confounding methodological effects when
   evaluating results. We used 991 marked spotted owls in the analysis of
   apparent survival. Apparent survival probability was higher for adult
   than for subadult owls. There was little difference in apparent survival
   between male and female owls. Model-averaged mean estimates of apparent
   survival probability of adult owls varied from 0.811 +/- 0.021 for
   females at LAS to 0.890 +/- 0.016 for males at SKC. Apparent survival
   increased over time for owls of all age classes at LAS and SIE, for
   adults at ELD, and for second-year subadults and adults at SKC. The
   meta-analysis of apparent survival, which included only adult owls,
   confirmed an increasing trend in survival over time. Survival rates were
   higher for owls on SKC than on the other study areas.
   We analyzed data from 1,865 observations of reproductive outcomes for
   female spotted owls. The proportion of subadult females among all
   territorial females of known age ranged from 0.00 to 0.25 among study
   areas and years. The proportion of subadults among female spotted owls
   was negatively related to reproductive output (no. of young
   fledged/territorial F owl) for ELD and SIE. Eldorado study area and LAS
   showed an alternate-year trend in reproductive output, with higher
   output in even-numbered years. Mean annual reproductive output was 0.988
   +/- 0.154 for ELD, 0.624 +/- 0.140 for LAS, 0.478 +/- 0.106 for SIE, and
   0.555 +/- 0.110 for SKC. Eldorado Study Area exhibited a declining trend
   and the greatest variation in reproductive output over time, whereas SIE
   and SKC, which had the lowest reproductive output, had the lowest
   temporal variation. Meta-analysis confirmed that reproductive output
   varied among study areas. Reproductive output was highest for adults,
   followed by second-year subadults, and then by first-year subadults.
   We used 842 marked subadult and adult owls to estimate population rate
   of change. Modeling indicated that lambda(t) (lambda(t) is the finite
   rate of population change estimated using the reparameterized
   Jolly-Seber estimator {[}Pradel 1996]) was either stationary (LAS and
   SIE) or increasing after an initial decrease (ELD and SKC). Mean
   estimated lt for the 4 study areas was 1.007 (95\% CI 5 0.952-1.066) for
   ELD; 0.973 (95\% CI 5 0.946-1.001) for LAS; 0.992 (95\% CI 5
   0.966-1.018) for SIE; and 1.006 (95\% CI 5 0.947-1.068) for SKC. The
   best meta-analysis model of population trend indicated that l varied
   across time but was similar in trend among the study areas. Our
   estimates of realized population change (Delta Franklin et al. 2004),
   which we estimated as the product 1 x (lambda) over cap (3) x (lambda)
   over cap (1) x ... x (lambda) over cap (k-1), were based on estimates of
   lambda(t) from individual study areas and did not require estimating
   annual population size for each study area. Trends represented the
   proportion of the population size in the first year that remained in
   each subsequent year. Similar to (lambda) over cap (t) on which they
   were based, these (Delta) over cap (t) showed evidence of decline over
   the study period for LAS and SIE. The best model indicated recruitment
   of male and female adult and subadults varied from 0.10 to 0.31 new
   territorial individuals at time t/number of territorial individuals at
   time t - 1 and similarly among areas. We also conducted a population
   viability analysis (PVA) based on results of our meta-analysis. This PVA
   was of limited utility for ELD and SKC study areas because 95\%
   confidence intervals on the probability of decline or increase spanned
   the interval {[}0, 1] within 5-10 years. When we restricted inferences
   to 7 years, estimated probability of a >10\% decline for SIE was 0.41
   (95\% CI 5 0.09-0.78); for LAS the probability was 0.64 (95\% CI 5
   0.27-0.94). In contrast, estimated probability of a >10\% increase in 7
   years for SIE was 0.23 (95\% CI 5 0.01-0.55) and for LAS was 0.10 (95\%
   CI 5 0.00-0.34). For comparisons, we simulated a PVA for a hypothetical
   population with mean lambda = 1.0 and the same temporal variation as
   observed in our owl populations. Our PVA suggested that both the SIE and
   LAS populations had higher probabilities of declining in a 7-year period
   than increasing but that it would be difficult to determine if a
   population was in a slight gradual decline. Our analysis and the
   repository of information on our 4 study populations provide a data-rich
   template for managers to monitor impacts of future management actions on
   the owl. Specifically, our data can be used to evaluate the effect of
   management strategies on spotted owls that are being implemented by the
   United States Forest Service to reduce the risk of wildfire in the
   Sierra Nevada ecosystem. Our information also provides baseline
   information for evaluating the status of the owl for potential listing
   as a threatened species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.}},

Abstract = {{Public expectations of soil management are gradually expanding beyond
   traditional primary production requirements to include diverse ecosystem
   services. In Australia, as in many other countries, the accommodation of
   these new expectations will require shifts in the practice of private
   land managers. In turn. this may require public intervention and the
   expenditure of public funds. However, public net benefits from soil
   management interventions are rarely established, in part due to a lack
   of understanding of the conceptual links between management changes,
   soil health, and associated services and benefits. This paper uses an
   ecosystem services-based approach to examine these links from an
   Australian perspective.
   Entrenchment of the popular soil health concept in field-based
   assessments of agricultural production potential was found to limit the
   concept's applicability to questions of broader public benefit. Without
   expanding soil health to include more ecological indicators, the concept
   risks remaining peripheral to contemporary visions of multiple-outcome
   soil management in Australia. Conceptual and case study links were
   examined between soil properties and processes, soil-based services, and
   private and public net benefits. In this framework, benefits were
   produced from services, and were considered a more tangible point for
   public understanding and valuation than services. The qualitative case
   study highlighted many knowledge gaps relating to non-agricultural
   services and benefits from soils, particularly in the scaling-up of
   sub-paddock measurements, and in the form and constancy of relationships
   among services and benefits. Criteria for identifying priority public
   benefits from soil management were examined, namely, likelihood, degree,
   consequence, scale, direction, time lag, and valuation. Assumptions
   about these criteria require rigorous testing so that the what, where,
   when, and how of public benefits from changed soil management can be
   more clearly defined. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Arthropods have been regarded as good indicators of habitat quality due

   examined a novel approach for detecting changes in web-building spider
   communities by focussing on the types of webs that spiders build rather
   than the spider itself. This method was cost-effective, easy-to-use, and
   importantly, we found a strong congruency between the diversity of web
   architecture and the diversity of web-building spider genera. The
   metrics derived from this method could distinguish differences in
   web-building communities among habitat types that represented a
   successional gradient, and thus we concluded that the method was useful
   for monitoring the progress of restoration. Many other applications for
   the method are possible such as environmental impact assessment and

Abstract = {{The spatial and temporal organization of ecological processes and
   features and the scales at which they occur are central topics to
   landscape ecology and metapopulation dynamics, and increasingly regarded
   as a cornerstone paradigm for understanding ecological processes. Hence,
   there is need for computational approaches which allow the
   identification of the proper spatial or temporal scales of ecological
   processes and the explicit integration of that information in models.
   For that purpose, we propose a new method (multiscale codependence
   analysis, MCA) to test the statistical significance of the correlations
   between two variables at particular spatial or temporal scales.
   Validation of the method (using Monte Carlo simulations) included the
   study of type I error rate, under five statistical significance
   thresholds, and of type II error rate and statistical power. The method
   was found to be valid, in terms of type I error rate, and to have
   sufficient statistical power to be useful in practice. MCA has
   assumptions that are met in a wide range of circumstances. When applied
   to model the river habitat of juvenile Atlantic salmon, MCA revealed
   that variables describing substrate composition of the river bed were
   the most influential predictors of parr abundance at 0.4-4.1 km scales
   whereas mean channel depth was more influential at 200-300 m scales.
   When properly assessed, the spatial structuring observed in nature may
   be used purposefully to refine our understanding of natural processes

Abstract = {{P>1. Biological invasions represent a major threat to human health,
   ecosystem functioning and global biodiversity. Insect pests affecting
   agriculture and forestry are of special importance. Estimations of
   climatic similarity between a species' native range and potential zones
   of invasion can be useful for preventing new invasions, spreads and
   ulterior contacts among populations from multiple invasions.
   2. We estimated areas climatically favourable for the establishment of
   the western corn rootworm (WCR), an insect pest of maize Zea mays in
   North America that has recently invaded Central Europe through multiple
   invasions, and it has the potential of invasion mainly in the Northern
   Hemisphere.
   3. We used complementary techniques to assess the biological relevance
   of predictors and obtain areas of climatic favourability. The biological
   relevance of variables was first assessed accounting for two main
   components of the WCR's environmental niche (marginality and
   specialisation). Then, the most relevant predictors were used to obtain
   either climatic envelopes or environmental distances regarding the WCR's
   native range. Model outputs and predictor relevance were independently
   assessed in the currently invaded region of Europe and through the
   spatial projection of proposed physiological thresholds from previous
   empirical studies. Lastly, as examples of application for given time
   periods, we fed back results of environmental distances with maize data
   for a 10-year period in Europe, and refined global risk maps with the
   main maize zones for the year 2000.
   4. We present global zones of climatic favourability and invasion risk
   for the WCR, with emphasis on the Northern Hemisphere. The northern and
   north-west range limits predicted by the climatic envelope in the WCR's
   native range mirrored the independently characterised physiological
   limits. Also, our model outputs explained some of the patterns observed
   in Europe supporting the validity of our procedures.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Assessments of climatic favourability for
   the western corn rootworm can provide information on areas of invasion
   risk. Our study highlights the combination of holistic and reductionist
   approaches as a useful protocol to evaluate models and/or infer
   causality. Our methodology can be an efficient tool in combating future
   potential invasions, spreads and secondary contact zones of insect pests
   by reducing uncertainty regarding where to allocate prevention and/or
   eradication efforts.}},

Title = {{Contrasting responses to water deficits of Nothofagus species from

Abstract = {{Aim
   Comparative responses of Nothofagus species to water deficits were
   studied to determine whether rainfall regimes could limit the
   latitudinal ranges of tropical and temperate forest species.
   Location
   The study species are native to New Guinea, New Caledonia, Australia,
   New Zealand, Chile and Argentina.
   Methods
   Seedlings of Nothofagus species from a broad latitudinal range were
   grown in a common environment. Changes in conductance, relative water
   content and water potential were measured in detached shoots, and
   together with measurements of tissue injury and biomass allocation, were
   compared between tropical and temperate species.
   Results
   Differences in responses to water deficits between tropical and
   temperate species appear to reflect differences in climate regimes. In
   particular, species native to ever-wet rainfall regimes in New Guinea,
   where water deficits are generally likely to be short-lived, were
   effective at conserving water by reduced stomatal conductance. In
   contrast, high-latitude evergreen species on average showed greater
   development of traits that should enhance water uptake. This was
   particularly evident in Nothofagus cunninghamii from southern Australia,
   which developed low water potentials at moderate levels of tissue water
   deficit and higher root:leaf biomass than tropical species, potentially
   allowing carbon assimilation to be maximized during warmer, but drier,
   summer months. However, water relations varied among high-latitude
   species. In particular, deciduous species on average showed higher rates
   of conductance, even during moderate levels of tissue water deficit,
   than evergreen species.
   Main conclusions
   The tropical species appear to conserve water during periods of water
   deficit (relative to temperate species), which is unlikely to have
   substantial opportunity costs for growth in ever-wet climates. However,
   spread of tropical species to higher latitudes may be limited by water
   conservation strategies that limit carbon gain in climates in which
   temperature seasonality is often paired with drier summers. Evergreen
   species from high latitudes, such as N. cunninghamii, commonly showed
   traits that should increase water uptake. However, this strategy, while
   probably maximizing growth in temperate climates with cool winters and
   drier summers, must limit competitiveness at lower latitudes in
   summer-wet climates. We conclude that responses to water regimes may
   make a significant contribution to the latitudinal limits of some
   evergreen rain forest species.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological communities can undergo sudden and dramatic shifts between
   alternative persistent community states. Both ecological prediction and
   natural resource management rely on understanding the mechanisms that
   trigger such shifts and maintain each state. Differentiating between
   potential mechanisms is difficult, however, because shifts are often
   recognized only in hindsight and many occur on such large spatial scales
   that manipulative experiments to test their causes are difficult or
   impossible. Here we use an approach that focuses first on identifying
   changes in environmental factors that could have triggered a given state
   change, and second on examining whether these changes were sustained
   (and thus potentially maintained the new state) or transitory
   (explaining the shift but not its persistence). We use this approach to
   evaluate a community shift in which a benthic marine species of filter
   feeding sea cucumber (Pachythyone rubra) suddenly came to dominate
   subtidal rocky reefs that had previously supported high abundances of
   macroalgae, persisted for more than a decade, then abruptly declined. We
   found that a sustained period without large wave events coincided with
   the shift to sea cucumber dominance, but that the sea cucumbers
   persisted even after the end of this low wave period, indicating that
   different mechanisms maintained the new community. Additionally, the
   period of sea cucumber dominance occurred when their predators were
   rare, and increases in the abundance of these predators coincided with
   the end of sea cucumber dominance. These results underscore the complex
   nature of regime shifts and illustrate that focusing separately on the
   causes and maintenance of state change can be a productive first step
   for analyzing these shifts in a range of systems.}},

Abstract = {{Species distribution models (SDMs) can provide useful information for
   managing biological invasions, such as identification of priority areas
   for early detection or for determining containment boundaries. However,
   prediction of invasive species using SDMs can be challenging because
   they typically violate the core assumption of being at equilibrium with
   their environment, which may lead to poorly guided management resulting
   from high levels of omission. Our goal was to provide a suite of
   potential decision strategies (DSs) that were not reliant on the
   equilibrium assumption but rather could be chosen to better match the
   management application, which in this case was to ensure containment
   through adequate surveillance. We used presence-only data and expert
   knowledge for model calibration and presence/absence data to evaluate
   the potential distribution of an introduced mesquite (Leguminoseae:
   Prosopis) invasion located in the Pilbara Region of northwest Western
   Australia. Five different DSs with varying levels of conservatism/risk
   were derived from a multi-criteria evaluation model using ordered
   weighted averaging. The performance of DSs over all possible thresholds
   was examined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. DSs
   not on the convex hull of the ROC curves were discarded. Two threshold
   determination methods (TDMs) were compared on the two remaining DSs, one
   that assumed equilibrium (by maximizing overall prediction success) and
   another that assumed the invasion was ongoing (using a 95\% threshold
   for true positives). The most conservative DS fitted the validation data
   most closely but could only predict 75\% of the presence data. A more
   risk-taking DS could predict 95\% of the presence data, which identified
   8.5 times more area for surveillance, and better highlighted known
   populations that are still rapidly invading. This DS and TOM coupling
   was considered to be the most appropriate for our management
   application. Our results show that predictive niche modeling was highly
   sensitive to risk levels, but that these can be tailored to match
   specified management objectives. The methods implemented can be readily
   adapted to other invasive species or for conservation purposes. Crown

Abstract = {{This paper argues that GDP growth in both developed and developing
   countries has associated costs that can outweigh the benefits and thus
   reduce sustainable well-being. This conclusion is based upon the
   findings of empirical applications of the Genuine Progress Indicator
   (GPI) to a range of countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The studies
   conducted on seven Asia-Pacific countries indicate that, in the case of
   five of the seven nations, more recent GDP growth has reduced the
   sustainable well-being experienced by the average citizen residing
   within them. Moreover, the threshold point at which the costs of GDP
   growth outweigh the benefits appears to be contracting (i.e., occurring
   at a much lower per capita level of GDP). This paper therefore
   introduces a new contracting threshold hypothesis: as the economies of
   the Asia-Pacific region and the world collectively expand in a
   globalised economic environment, there is a contraction over time in the
   threshold level of per capita GDP. As a consequence, the threshold point
   confronting growth late-comers (i.e., developing countries) occurs at a
   much lower level of sustainable welfare than what wealthy nations
   currently enjoy. The consequences of this for developing countries are
   clearly significant and require a new approach to economic development.

Abstract = {{The paper summarizes the author's theoretical and experimental
   researches aimed at studying the rule of stable coexistence of
   interacting microbial populations within same trophic level. Populations
   of yeast and algae interact in open continuous cultures through
   regulating factors (RFs), which come together by the ability to be
   released or taken up by a microbial population and affect the growth of
   this and other population. Theoretical and experimental studies show
   that in steady state, the number of coexisting species is not greater
   than the number of RFs. Two-dimensional regions with different resultant
   species compositions of experimental equilibrium communities are plotted
   in the coordinates of ``input levels of RFs{''}. This is perhaps the
   first study showing that the background steady-state levels of RFs in
   the system are not related to their input levels. This effect has been
   termed autostabilization of RFs, and its theoretical basis has been
   developed. A new criterion of intra-and inter-population microbial
   interactions has been introduced for RFs-growth acceleration response to
   a change in population density. Based on the proposed new criterion,
   experimental and theoretical estimates of the intensity and the sign of
   interactions between populations are given, allowing the quantification
   of their complex relationships, which was earlier unattainable. An
   integrated approach to detection of RFs has been proposed based on this

Abstract = {{A large number and wide variety of lake ecosystem models have been
   developed and published during the past four decades. We identify two
   challenges for making further progress in this field. One such challenge
   is to avoid developing more models largely following the concept of
   others ('reinventing the wheel'). The other challenge is to avoid
   focusing on only one type of model, while ignoring new and diverse
   approaches that have become available ('having tunnel vision'). In this
   paper, we aim at improving the awareness of existing models and
   knowledge of concurrent approaches in lake ecosystem modelling, without
   covering all possible model tools and avenues. First, we present a broad
   variety of modelling approaches. To illustrate these approaches, we give
   brief descriptions of rather arbitrarily selected sets of specific
   models. We deal with static models (steady state and regression models),
   complex dynamic models (CAEDYM, CE-QUAL-W2, Delft 3D-ECO, LakeMab,
   LakeWeb, MyLake, PCLake, PROTECH, SALMO), structurally dynamic models
   and minimal dynamic models. We also discuss a group of approaches that
   could all be classified as individual based: super-individual models
   (Piscator, Charisma), physiologically structured models,
   stage-structured models and traitbased models. We briefly mention
   genetic algorithms, neural networks, Kalman filters and fuzzy logic.
   Thereafter, we zoom in, as an in-depth example, on the multi-decadal
   development and application of the lake ecosystem model PCLake and
   related models (PCLake Metamodel, Lake Shira Model, IPH-TRIM3D-PCLake).
   In the discussion, we argue that while the historical development of
   each approach and model is understandable given its `leading principle',
   there are many opportunities for combining approaches. We take the point
   of view that a single `right' approach does not exist and should not be
   strived for. Instead, multiple modelling approaches, applied
   concurrently to a given problem, can help develop an integrative view on
   the functioning of lake ecosystems. We end with a set of specific
   recommendations that may be of help in the further development of lake
   ecosystem models.}},

Abstract = {{A new conceptual framework is presented for the assessment of the
   impacts of environmental change drivers on ecosystem service provision
   and the policy and management responses that would derive from the
   valuation of these impacts. The Framework for Ecosystem Service
   Provision (FESP), is based on an interpretation of the widely-used
   Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. FESP differs
   from the DPSIR by offering clarity in the definitions of the various
   DPSIR components as well as introducing novel elements of relevance to
   the ecosystem service approach. The value of a common framework lies in
   making the comparison across competing services accessible and clear as
   well as highlighting the conflicts and trade-offs between not only
   multiple ecosystem services, but also multiple service beneficiaries.
   The framework is explicit, for example, in recognising as state
   variables not only the attributes of the Ecosystem Service Providers
   (ESPs), but also the attributes of the Ecosystem Service Beneficiaries
   (ESBs). That a service depends as much on the attributes of the people
   whose well-being benefits from the service as on the attributes of the
   biology providing the service is an important step in integrated
   social-ecological thinking. FESP also identifies the mechanisms of
   either mitigation or adaptation to the environmental change problem
   through the effect of these response strategies on specific pressure or
   state variables. In this way, FESP can contribute to the policies and
   strategies that are used to support conservation management. This paper
   describes the principles of FESP and presents some indicative examples
   of its practical implementation.}},

Title = {{Current distribution and predicted geographic expansion of the

Abstract = {{Aim
   The Rufous-backed Robin Turdus rufopalliatus is a bird endemic to the
   Pacific slope of Mexico. The species recently established populations in
   several localities in the Mexican Central Highlands. Based on available
   data, we modelled the range expansion of the Rufous-backed Robin in
   Mexico to understand the pattern, mechanisms and ecological and
   biogeographic implications of its expansion.
   Location
   Mexico.
   Methods
   We assessed the species' presence and habitat requirements at two
   spatial scales. At the site level, we evaluated the relationship between
   land use and species presence in an urban environment. At the country
   level, we generated a niche model. We then produced a dispersion model
   through the interpolation of points generated from information derived
   from the niche model, the location of records within and outside its
   native distribution range, the species' natural history, habitat
   requirements and its estimated dispersion rate (4.2 km year-1).
   Results
   The dispersion model predicted that the species will significantly
   increase its distribution range in Mexico in the coming decades. Its
   expansion would occur by a stepping-stone colonization of suitable
   habitat in areas of native vegetation and human settlements. The model
   predicted that the species should arrive on the Gulf slope of Mexico
   before 2025.
   Main conclusions
   Mechanisms that could explain the species' success in establishing
   viable populations outside its native distribution include its
   dispersion ability, competitive release, the urban heat island
   phenomenon and the trade of wild birds. The geographic range expansion
   of the Rufous-backed Robin will probably create new interactions with
   other species, particularly with close taxonomic and ecological
   relatives. The increase in the distribution range of the Rufous-backed
   Robin has resulted from direct and indirect human-induced dispersion;
   therefore, it cannot be considered a fading endemism. In part of its
   expanded range (to date the Mexican Central Highlands), it should be
   considered an invasive alien species.}},

Abstract = {{Most bioassessment tools are based on the Reference Condition Approach
   (RCA), where the biological integrity of a site is defined by the
   ``distance{''} between current conditions and its reference condition
   status. Among them, the Eastern Canadian Diatom Index (IDEC) was
   developed to evaluate the ecological integrity of streams along an
   alteration gradient, as a function of the dissimilarity of their diatom
   community from their suitable reference communities. In the first
   version of the IDEC, the alteration gradient was arbitrarily divided,
   like most traditional approaches, into five classes of equal size
   representing the qualitative statuses of the site. In this article, we
   propose a remodeling of those classes by introducing ecologically
   meaningful thresholds, reducing the subjectivity in the determination of
   the number and the range (widths) of classes. We developed a new
   approach which uses biotypes issued from a classification technique
   (Self-Organizing Maps) to determine thresholds between integrity classes
   of the IDEC. These biotypes represent relatively homogenous ecological
   entities composed of taxa adapted to a particular biological integrity
   status. Based on these biotypes, four classes were established. The new
   limits between classes are now based on the maximum ecological distance
   between diatom groups, and the transition from one class to another may
   be related to major ecological thresholds that induce important shifts
   in community structure. The proposed biotype-based approach allows for
   the identification of ecologically meaningful differences among
   biological communities and provides a more relevant interpretation of
   the community changes along the alteration gradient. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Future climate scenarios predict simultaneous changes in environmental

   (3.5A degrees C temperature increase, 20\% reduction in summer
   precipitation, atmospheric CO2 levels of 600 ppm) over three growing
   seasons. We also assessed whether patterns of grassland response to a
   combination of climate change treatments could be forecast by ecosystem
   responses to single climate change drivers. Effects of climate change on
   aboveground production showed considerable seasonal and interannual
   variation; April biomass increased in response to both warming and the
   simultaneous application of warming, summer drought, and CO2 enrichment,
   whereas October biomass responses were either non-significant or
   negative depending on the year. Negative impacts of summer drought on
   production were only observed in combination with a below-average
   rainfall regime, and showed lagged effects on spring biomass. Elevated
   CO2 had no significant effect on aboveground biomass during this study.
   Both warming and the 2080 climate change scenario were associated with a
   significant advance in flowering time for the dominant grass species
   studied. However, flowering phenology showed no significant response to
   either summer drought or elevated CO2. Species diversity and
   equitability showed no response to climate change treatments throughout
   this study. Overall, our data suggest that single-factor warming
   experiments may provide valuable information for projections of future
   ecosystem changes in cool temperate grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   To map and characterize anthropogenic transformation of the terrestrial
   biosphere before and during the Industrial Revolution, from 1700 to
   2000.
   Location
   Global.
   Methods
   Anthropogenic biomes (anthromes) were mapped for 1700, 1800, 1900 and
   2000 using a rule-based anthrome classification model applied to gridded
   global data for human population density and land use. Anthropogenic
   transformation of terrestrial biomes was then characterized by map
   comparisons at century intervals.
   Results
   In 1700, nearly half of the terrestrial biosphere was wild, without
   human settlements or substantial land use. Most of the remainder was in
   a seminatural state (45\%) having only minor use for agriculture and
   settlements. By 2000, the opposite was true, with the majority of the
   biosphere in agricultural and settled anthromes, less than 20\%
   seminatural and only a quarter left wild. Anthropogenic transformation
   of the biosphere during the Industrial Revolution resulted about equally
   from land-use expansion into wildlands and intensification of land use
   within seminatural anthromes. Transformation pathways differed strongly
   between biomes and regions, with some remaining mostly wild but with the
   majority almost completely transformed into rangelands, croplands and
   villages. In the process of transforming almost 39\% of earth's total
   ice-free surface into agricultural land and settlements, an additional
   37\% of global land without such use has become embedded within
   agricultural and settled anthromes.
   Main conclusions
   Between 1700 and 2000, the terrestrial biosphere made the critical
   transition from mostly wild to mostly anthropogenic, passing the 50\%
   mark early in the 20th century. At present, and ever more in the future,
   the form and process of terrestrial ecosystems in most biomes will be
   predominantly anthropogenic, the product of land use and other direct
   human interactions with ecosystems. Ecological research and conservation
   efforts in all but a few biomes would benefit from a primary focus on
   the novel remnant, recovering and managed ecosystems embedded within
   used lands.}},

Title = {{Assessing the impacts of fragmentation on plant communities in New
   Zealand: scaling from survey plots to landscapes}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{741-754}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   Few studies have attempted to assess the overall impact of fragmentation
   at the landscape scale. We quantify the impacts of fragmentation on
   plant diversity by assessing patterns of community composition in
   relation to a range of fragmentation measures.
   Location
   The investigation was undertaken in two regions of New Zealand - a
   relatively unfragmented area of lowland rain forest in south Westland
   and a highly fragmented montane forest on the eastern slopes of the
   Southern Alps.
   Methods
   We calculated an index of community similarity (Bray-Curtis) between
   forest plots we regarded as potentially affected by fragmentation and
   control forest plots located deep inside continuous forest areas. Using
   a multiple nonlinear regression technique that incorporates spatial
   autocorrelation effects, we analysed plant community composition in
   relation to measures of fragmentation at the patch and landscape levels.
   From the resulting regression equation, we predicted community
   composition for every forest pixel on land-cover maps of the study areas
   and used these maps to calculate a landscape-level estimate of
   compositional change, which we term `BioFrag'. BioFrag has a value of
   one if fragmentation has no detectable effect on communities within a
   landscape, and tends towards zero if fragmentation has a strong effect.
   Results
   We detected a weak, but significant, impact of fragmentation metrics
   operating at both the patch and landscape levels. Observed values of
   BioFrag ranged from 0.68 to 0.90, suggesting that patterns of
   fragmentation have medium to weak impacts on forest plant communities in
   New Zealand. BioFrag values varied in meaningful ways among landscapes
   and between the ground-cover and tree and shrub communities.
   Main conclusions
   BioFrag advances methods that describe spatial patterns of forest cover
   by incorporating the exact spatial patterns of observed species
   responses to fragmentation operating at multiple spatial scales. BioFrag
   can be applied to any landscape and ecological community across the
   globe and represents a significant step towards developing a
   biologically relevant, landscape-scale index of habitat fragmentation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1657-1667}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   Patterns of phylogeographical diversity in eastern North America have
   been well documented, with suggestions of Pleistocene refugia in both
   coastal and interior regions. However, most studies to date have
   assessed these patterns only qualitatively, largely through visual
   observation of haplotype networks. Furthermore, many plant studies use
   only one or two individuals per locality, which probably limits the
   recovery of haplotype diversity. The aim of this study is to address the
   issues of sampling strategy and quantitative assessment of
   phylogeographical patterns in an eastern North American tree, Fagus
   grandifolia (American beech).
   Location
   Eastern North America.
   Methods
   Comparing two sampling strategies (more localities with lower sample
   size within localities versus fewer localities with increased sample
   size within localities), we analysed chloroplast DNA sequence data from
   more than 230 individuals across 130 localities using statistical
   parsimony, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses.
   We then assessed support for inferred phylogenetic relationships using
   Monmonier's algorithm and analysis of molecular variance. As an
   additional test of biogeographic hypotheses, we employed ecological
   niche models (ENMs), which are used to predict the geographic range of a
   species from occurrence data and environmental records. Here we predict
   both present and palaeodistributions.
   Results
   More haplotypes were recovered when more localities were sampled, but
   novel haplotypes and haplotype distributions were recovered using both
   strategies. Phylogeographical patterns suggest possible Pleistocene
   refugia along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts according to ENMs, as well as
   a more interior refugium according to Monmonier's algorithm.
   Main conclusions
   Monmonier's algorithm supports previous findings of an interior refugium
   in the Lower Mississippi River Valley/Upper Midwest, while ENMs indicate
   that the Gulf and Atlantic coasts may have provided the most suitable
   habitat for F. grandifolia during the Pleistocene. Our findings allow us
   to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches. We
   propose that future phylogeographical studies should follow a step-wise
   sampling strategy, balancing cost and expected outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   Woody plant expansion and infilling in grasslands and savannas are
   occurring across a broad range of ecosystems around the globe and are
   commonly attributed to fire suppression, livestock grazing, nutrient
   enrichment and/or climate variability. In the western Great Plains,
   ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) woodlands are expanding across broad
   geographical and environmental gradients. The objective of this study
   was to reconstruct the establishment of ponderosa pine in woodlands in
   the west-central Great Plains and to identify whether it was mediated by
   climate variability.
   Location
   Our study took place in a 400-km wide region from the base of the Front
   Range Mountains (c. 105 degrees W) to the central Great Plains (c. 100
   degrees W) and from Nebraska (43 degrees N) to northern New Mexico (36
   degrees N), USA.
   Methods
   Dates for establishment of ponderosa pine were reconstructed with tree
   rings in 11 woodland sites distributed across the longitudinal and
   latitudinal gradients of the study area. Temporal trends in decadal pine
   establishment were compared with summer Palmer Drought Severity Index
   (PDSI). Annual trends in pine establishment from 1985 to 2005 were
   compared with seasonal PDSI, temperature and moisture availability.
   Results
   Establishment of ponderosa pine occurred in the study area in all but
   one decade (1770s) between the 1750s and the early 2000s, with over 35\%
   of establishment in the region occurring after 1980. Pine establishment
   was highly variable among sites. Across the region, decadal pine
   establishment was persistently low from 1940 to 1960, when PDSI was
   below average. Annual pine establishment from 1985 to 2005 was
   positively correlated with summer PDSI and inversely correlated with
   minimum spring temperatures.
   Main conclusions
   Most ponderosa pine woodlands pre-date widespread Euro-American
   settlement of the region around c. ad 1860 and currently have stable
   tree populations. High variability in the timing of establishment of
   pine among sites highlights the multiplicity of factors that can drive
   woodland dynamics, including land use, fire history, CO(2) enrichment,
   tree population dynamics and climate. Since the 1840s, the influence of
   climate was most notable across the study area during the mid-20th
   century, when the establishment of pine was suppressed by two
   significant droughts. The past sensitivity of establishment of ponderosa
   pine to drought suggests that woodland expansion will be negatively
   affected by predicted increases in temperature and drought in the Great
   Plains.}},

Abstract = {{We present a visually based method for the taxonomic identification of
   benthic invertebrates that automates image capture, image processing,

   and images specimens with minimal user input. Images are then processed
   with interest operators (machine-learning algorithms for locating
   informative visual regions) to identify informative pattern features,
   and this information is used to train a classifier algorithm. Naive
   Bayes modeling of stacked decision trees is used to determine whether a
   specimen is an unknown distractor (taxon not in the training data set)
   or one of the species in the training set. When tested on images from 9
   larval stonefly taxa, BugID correctly identified 94.5\% of images, even
   though small or damaged specimens were included in testing. When
   distractor taxa (10 common invertebrates not present in the training
   set) were included to make classification more challenging, overall
   accuracy decreased but generally was close to 90\%. At the equal error
   rate (EER), 89.5\% of stonefly images were correctly classified and the
   accuracy of nonrejected stoneflies increased to 96.4\%, a result
   suggesting that many difficult-to-identify or poorly imaged stonefly
   specimens had been rejected prior to classification. BugID is the first
   system of its kind that allows users to select thresholds for rejection
   depending on the required use. Rejected images of distractor taxa or
   difficult specimens can be identified later by a taxonomic expert, and
   new taxa ultimately can be incorporated into the training set of known

   classification systems, including automated handling of specimens, the
   ability to isolate nontarget and novel species, and the ability to
   identify specimens across different stages of larval development.}},

Abstract = {{Cultural eutrophication of surface waters has become a major source of
   water-quality impairment throughout the US. In response, the US
   Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has devised a national strategy
   for the development of regional nutrient criteria. Our study is part of
   New York State's effort to revise its narrative nutrient standard for N
   and P and is based on the USEPA's recommended weight-of-evidence
   approach. The objective of our investigation was to identify nutrient
   thresholds based on a final weighted average of results from percentile
   analysis, nonparametric deviance reduction (changepoint), and cluster
   analysis. The thresholds were determined from shifts in biological
   community structure (benthic macroinvertebrate and diatom) related to
   water-column nutrient data from 40 large river sites throughout New York
   State. USEPA's percentile analysis yielded possible criteria of 0.023 mg
   total P (TP)/L, 0.51 mg total N (TN)/L, 0.16 mg NO(3)-N /L, and 2.4 mg
   chlorophyll a (chl a)/m(3). Threshold responses in benthic
   macroinvertebrate metrics at the 50(th) percentile occurred at
   concentrations between 0.009 and 0.07 mg TP/L, 0.41 and 1.2 mg TN/L,
   0.18 and 0.55 mg NO(3)-N/L, and 2.1 mg chl a/m(3). Cluster analysis
   yielded 3 groups of sites based on macroinvertebrate and diatom taxa.
   The median nutrient values of the medium-nutrient-condition site
   clusters were used to set criteria for TP and TN. For site clusters
   based on macroinvertebrate data these values were 0.037 mg TP/L and 0.68
   mg TN/L. For clusters based on diatom data these were 0.037 mg TP/L and
   0.78 mg TN/L. Based on the weight-of-evidence approach and results from
   all 3 methods, the proposed guidance values for nutrients in large

Abstract = {{Nonlinear ecological responses to anthropogenic forcing are common, and
   in some cases, the ecosystem responds by assuming a new stable state.
   This article is an overview and serves as the introduction to several
   articles in this BRIDGES cluster that are directed toward managers
   interested in dealing with nonlinear responses in freshwaters,
   particularly streams. A threshold or breakpoint occurs where the system
   responds rapidly to a relatively small change in a driver. The existence
   of a threshold can signal a change in system configuration to an
   alternative stable state, although such a change does not occur with all
   thresholds. In general, a mechanistic understanding of ecological
   dynamics is required to predict thresholds, where they will occur, and
   if they are associated with the occurrence of alternative stable states.
   Thresholds are difficult to predict, although a variety of univariate
   methods has been used to indicate thresholds in ecological data. When we
   applied several methods to one type of response variable, the resulting
   threshold values varied 3-fold, indicating that more research on
   detection methods is necessary. Numerous case studies suggest that the
   threshold concept is important in all ecosystems. Managers should be
   aware that human actions might result in undesirable rapid changes and
   potentially an unwanted alternative stable state, and that recovery from
   that state might require far more resources and time than avoiding
   entering the state in the first place would have required. Given the
   difficulties in predicting thresholds and alternative states, the
   precautionary approach to ecosystem management is probably the most
   prudent.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological thresholds have been applied conventionally to characterize
   relationships between stressors and biological responses. We
   demonstrated how ecological thresholds can be used to assess recovery in
   a system where stressors have been removed. We applied a relatively new
   statistical approach, the significant zero crossings (SiZer) model,
   which approximates a response function and its derivatives and then
   shows how these functions vary across the range of an explanatory
   variable. We applied the model to a long-term macroinvertebrate data set
   collected from the Arkansas River, a Colorado stream undergoing
   restoration from historical mining pollution. SiZer analysis identified
   distinct threshold responses of benthic communities through time and
   related these shifts to improvements in water quality. With respect to
   restoration success, a recovery threshold was observed similar to 10 y
   after clean up was initiated. Recovery trajectories in the Arkansas
   River were relatively complex, with multiple thresholds, and these
   responses were strongly influenced by temporal variation in heavy metal
   concentrations and stream discharge. A unique aspect of SiZer is that it
   easily handles multiple thresholds and displays significant change
   points along a predictor variable graphically. In addition, SiZer allows
   investigators to examine potential thresholds at different levels of
   resolution and provides a transparent representation of the threshold
   and how it responds to variability of the data.}},

Abstract = {{To provide habitat for late-successional wildlife species, new
   ecosystem-based forest management practices aim to retain elements of
   complex stand structure, including live residual trees, dead wood
   legacies, and advanced regeneration, within managed stands. Predicting
   the effectiveness of these strategies is a challenge for species whose
   habitat relationships may involve multiple factors and can vary among
   sites. For 2 years, we live-trapped a common, late-successional
   microtine rodent, the southern red-backed vole (Myodes {[}formerly
   Clethrionomys] gapperi), in 40 1.4-ha boreal mixedwood sites in Ontario,
   Canada. Using a neighborhood-scale modeling approach, we related
   red-backed vole capture locations to spatially referenced measures of
   overstory trees, shrubs and saplings, downed woody debris (DWD), and
   forest floor substrate. We further assessed how associations with these
   features varied with availability of the features within a site and as a
   function of stand management history. In spring, red-backed voles were
   associated with trap stations that had, within a 26-m radius, a dense
   shrub layer, abundant late-decay DWD, coniferous understory and litter,
   and possibly, understory vegetation associated with moist conditions.
   Positive associations with shrub cover, late-decay DWD, and a
   moisture-associated understory were most apparent in sites in which
   these elements were scarce (e.g., <1,500 stems/ha of hardwood saplings
   and short shrubs; <0.8\% projected ground cover of late-decay DWD). The
   importance of late-decay DWD; shade-tolerant, coniferous understory
   composition; and substrate varied depending on a site's management
   history, with each feature having a strong positive effect in
   47-64-year-old stands that were harvested using horse skidding and
   weaker effects in both 31-40-year-old stands that were clearcut with
   mechanical skidding and >80-year-old fire-origin stands. Our models of
   fine-scale habitat relationships for red-backed voles may be useful in
   establishing structural retention guidelines suitable for wildlife
   species dependent on late-successional habitat structure. In this
   regard, retaining abundant DWD and 10-30\% live trees at harvest may be
   effective management strategies for providing favorable habitat
   conditions at localized scales.}},

Abstract = {{Extrapolating simulations of bioenergy crop agro-ecosystems beyond
   data-rich sites requires biophysically accurate ecosystem models and
   careful estimation of model parameters not available in the literature.
   To increase biophysical accuracy we added C-4 perennial grass
   functionality and agricultural practices to the Biome-BGC
   (BioGeochemical Cycles) ecosystem model. This new model, Agro-BGC,
   includes enzyme-driven C-4 photosynthesis, individual live and dead
   leaf, stem, and root carbon and nitrogen pools, separate senescence and
   litter fall processes, fruit growth, optional annual seeding, flood
   irrigation, a growing degree day phenology with a killing frost option,
   and a disturbance handler that simulates nitrogen fertilization,
   harvest, fire, and incremental irrigation. To obtain spatially
   generalizable vegetation parameters we used a numerical method to
   optimize five unavailable parameters for Panicum virgatum (switchgrass)
   using biomass yield data from three sites: Mead, Nebraska, Rockspring,
   Pennsylvania, and Mandan, North Dakota. We then verified simulated
   switchgrass yields at three independent sites in Illinois (IL). Agro-BGC
   is more accurate than Biome-BGC in representing the physiology and
   dynamics of C-4 grass and management practices associated with
   agro-ecosystems. The simulated two-year average mature yields with
   single-site Rockspring optimization have Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE)
   of 70, 152, and 162 and biases of 43, -87, 156 g carbon m(-2) for
   Shabbona, Urbana, and Simpson IL respectively. The simulated annual
   yields in June, August, October, December, and February have RMSEs of
   114, 390, and 185 and biases of -19, -258, and 147 g carbon m(-2) for
   Shabbona, Urbana, and Simpson IL respectively. These RMSE and bias
   values are all within the largest 90\% confidence interval around
   respective IL site measurements. Twenty-four of twenty-six simulated
   annual yields with Rockspring optimization are within 95\% confidence
   intervals of Illinois site measurements during the mature fourth and
   fifth years of growth. Ten of eleven simulated two-year average mature
   yields with Rockspring optimization are within 65\% confidence intervals
   of Illinois site measurements and the eleventh is within the 95\%
   confidence interval. Rockspring optimized Agro-BGC achieves accuracies
   comparable to those of two previously published models: Agricultural
   Land Management Alternatives with Numerical Assessment Criteria
   (ALMANAC) and Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM). Agro-BGC suffers from
   static vegetation parameters that can change seasonally and as plants
   age. Using mature plant data for optimization mitigates this deficiency.
   Our results suggest that a multi-site optimization scheme using mature
   plant data from more sites would be adequate for generating spatially
   generalizable vegetation parameters for simulating mature bioenergy crop
   agro-ecosystems with Agro-BGC. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   First, for a fixed time interval, local controllability into equilibrium
   is proved, and applying tools of optimal control, it is also shown how
   an appropriate open-loop control can be determined that actually
   controls the system into the equilibrium in given time. Another
   considered problem is to control the system to a new desired
   equilibrium. The problem is solved by the construction of a closed-loop
   control which asymptotically steers the trophic chain into this new

Abstract = {{The history of conifers introduced earlier elsewhere in the southern
   hemisphere suggests that recent invasions in Argentina, Brazil, Chile
   and Uruguay are likely to increase in number and size. In South Africa,
   New Zealand and Australia, early ornamental introductions and small
   forestry plantations did not lead to large-scale invasions, while
   subsequent large plantations were followed with a lag of about 20-30
   years by troublesome invasions. Large-scale conifer plantation forestry
   in South America began about 50-80 years later than in South Africa,
   Australia and New Zealand, while reports of invasions in South America
   lagged behind those in the latter nations by a century. Impacts of
   invading non-native conifers outside South America are varied and
   include replacement of grassland and shrubland by conifer forest,
   alteration of fire and hydrological regimes, modification of soil
   nutrients, and changes in aboveground and belowground biotic
   communities. Several of these effects have already been detected in
   various parts of South America undergoing conifer invasion. The sheer
   amount of area planted in conifers is already very large in Chile and
   growing rapidly in Argentina and Brazil. This mass of reproductive
   trees, in turn, produces an enormous propagule pressure that may
   accelerate ongoing invasions and spark new ones at an increasing rate.
   Regulations to control conifer invasions, including measures to mitigate
   spread, were belatedly implemented in New Zealand and South Africa, as
   well as in certain Australian states, inspired by observations on
   invasions in those nations. Regulations in South America are weaker and
   piecemeal, but the existing research base on conifer invasions elsewhere
   could be useful in fashioning effective regulations in South America.
   Pressure from foreign customers in South Africa has led most companies
   there to seek certification through the Forestry Stewardship Council; a
   similar programme operates in Australia. Such an approach may be
   promising in South America.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions have important ecological impacts at both local and
   global levels, affecting biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and
   economic sustainability. The study of invasions requires specific
   methodological approaches to gain rapid insight into the spatial and
   temporal dynamics of the system. We studied a recent invasion by the
   exotic herb Hieracium pilosella L. (Mouse-ear hawkweed, Asteraceae) in
   the Argentinean portion of the northern part of Tierra del Fuego Island
   in Southern Patagonia. To assess the extent of this invasion and the
   related ecological and land use factors, we performed an extensive field
   sampling at a regional scale and used a spatial pattern approach using
   geostatistical techniques to build a map of the invasion. Our results
   showed that the invading species is widely distributed across the entire
   Fuegian steppe, in general with low cover (< 2\%) and a particular
   spatial structure having hot spots (10-70\%) related to specific land
   uses. We found regional-latitudinal and also local-community level
   variability in the frequency, cover and spatial distribution of the
   invasive species, each of them associated with particular ecological
   factors, and no association with regular domestic animal grazing.
   Region-wide invasion may be accounted for by wind dispersal of the seeds
   and the latitudinal variability of the precipitation; while
   local-variability was associated with the susceptibility of different
   plant communities to invasion. Hot spots were found to be related to
   massive soil disturbances (e.g., road building, shrub removal, physical
   impacts of long-term and intense domestic animal use, etc.), probably
   due to the presence of bare soil favoring colonization by the invading
   species. Scrublands, lawns and grasslands were more invaded than
   wetlands, heathlands or salt grasslands. Since the invasion is
   apparently at initial stages due to the low cover values found, we
   believe that information about the extent and environmental or
   management factors involved in this exotic plant's expansion should be
   used to design appropriate control and mitigation tools. In this sense,
   our results point to management actions focused on reducing the presence
   of hot spots of invasion by means of quick revegetation of bare soil
   after a massive disturbance event takes place.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few decades petroleum has been consumed at a much faster
   pace than new reserves have been discovered. The point at which global
   oil extraction will attain a peak ({''}peak oil{''}) and begin a period
   of unavoidable decline is approaching. This eventuality will drive
   fundamental changes in the quantity and nature of energy flows through
   the human economic system, which probably will be accompanied by
   economic turmoil, political conflicts, and a high level of social
   tension. Besides being a geological and economic issue, peak oil is also
   a fundamental concern as it pertains to ecological systems and
   conservation because economics is a subsystem of the global ecosystem
   and changes in human energy-related behaviors can lead to a broad range
   of effects on natural ecosystems, ranging from overuse to abandonment.
   As it becomes more difficult to meet energy demands, environmental
   considerations may be easily superseded. Given the vital importance of
   ecosystems and ecosystem services in a postpetroleum era, it is
   crucially important to wisely manage our ecosystems during the
   transition period to an economy based on little or no use of fossil
   fuels. Good policies can be formulated through awareness and
   understanding gained from scenario-based assessments. Presently, most
   widely used global scenarios of environmental change do not incorporate
   resource limitation, including those of the Millennium Ecosystem
   Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
   Considering the potential magnitude of the effects of peak oil on
   society and nature, the development of resource-constrained scenarios
   should be addressed immediately. Ecologists and conservation biologists
   are in an important position to analyze the situation and provide
   guidance, yet the topic is noticeably absent from ecological
   discussions. We urge politicians, corporate chief executives, thought
   leaders, and citizens to consider this problem seriously because it is
   likely to develop into one of the key environmental issues of the 21st
   century.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. The acute phase immune response, which includes fever and sickness
   behaviours, carries high costs in energy and time, but enhances pathogen
   clearance in diverse hosts. Hypotheses based upon pathogen pressures and
   life-history trade-offs predict that costly immune responses will
   decrease in strength as latitude increases. However, whether the acute
   phase response shows latitudinal patterns among free-living, wild
   populations remains unknown.
   2. Here, we studied fever and sickness behaviours during the early
   breeding season in free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) along a
   latitudinal gradient in southern California (CA), Washington (WA), and
   Alaska (AK). In 2007 and 2008, we injected males with lipopolysaccharide
   and assessed sickness behaviour by measuring changes in territorial
   aggression. In 2008, we monitored fever and sickness behaviour in CA and
   WA birds using a novel telemetric technique: skin-mounted
   radiotransmitters with temperature sensors.
   3. In 2007, territorial defence varied by latitude, with a lower
   probability of territorial response at 24 h after injection in CA, but
   not in WA or AK. Radiotelemetry in 2008 revealed that CA birds showed
   pronounced and prolonged lethargy and fever (c. 2 degrees C above
   control males throughout the night), whereas WA birds showed only
   moderate lethargy and fever (c. 1 degrees C, returning to control levels
   during the night).
   4. This study establishes radiotelemetry as a powerful method for
   quantifying fever and sickness behaviours in small, free-living
   vertebrates. Moreover, our data suggest that latitude predicts the
   strength of these responses. These results can provide insight into
   disease susceptibility and spread among wild populations.}},

   We reviewed secondary succession studies across the Eastern Deciduous
   Forest (EDF) of North America.
   Methods
   We collected data from all published studies that reported the time
   necessary for woody species to reach either 10\% or 50\% cover in
   old-field systems throughout the EDF. We used regression approaches to
   determine whether rates of succession are controlled by climatic and
   edaphic factors that vary at broad spatial scales.
   Results
   We found that the rate at which woody species colonize and dominate old
   fields decreases significantly with latitude. Rates of woody succession
   were highly correlated with both annual temperature (growing degree-days
   for years to 10\% and 50\% cover) and measures of soil fertility (cation
   exchange capacity and reported pre-agroindustrial (1930) maize yields
   for years to 10\% cover), all of which show a significant latitudinal
   trend across the EDF.
   Main conclusions
   We suggest that the driver of this pattern is geographic variation in
   the intensity of competition between herbaceous and woody species, which
   we relate to the effects of (1) temperature regime, (2) edaphic factors
   related to soil fertility, and (3) plant traits, which may vary
   latitudinally in response to climate and edaphic factors. Although
   insufficient data exist to evaluate the relative importance of these
   factors, we argue that research in this area is necessary to gain an
   understanding of how future landscapes will be affected by global
   climate and land use change.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological opportunity - through entry into a new environment, the
   origin of a key innovation or extinction of antagonists - is widely
   thought to link ecological population dynamics to evolutionary
   diversification. The population-level processes arising from ecological
   opportunity are well documented under the concept of ecological release.
   However, there is little consensus as to how these processes promote
   phenotypic diversification, rapid speciation and adaptive radiation. We
   propose that ecological opportunity could promote adaptive radiation by
   generating specific changes to the selective regimes acting on natural
   populations, both by relaxing effective stabilizing selection and by
   creating conditions that ultimately generate diversifying selection. We
   assess theoretical and empirical evidence for these effects of
   ecological opportunity and review emerging phylogenetic approaches that
   attempt to detect the signature of ecological opportunity across
   geological time. Finally, we evaluate the evidence for the evolutionary
   effects of ecological opportunity in the diversification of Caribbean
   Anolis lizards. Some of the processes that could link ecological
   opportunity to adaptive radiation are well documented, but others remain
   unsupported. We suggest that more study is required to characterize the
   form of natural selection acting on natural populations and to better
   describe the relationship between ecological opportunity and speciation
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{Animal coloration has provided many classical examples of both natural
   and sexual selection. Methods to study color signals range from human
   assessment to models of receiver vision, with objective measurements
   commonly involving spectrometry or digital photography. However, signal
   assessment by a receiver is not objective but linked to receiver
   perception. Here, we use standardized digital photographs of female
   rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) face and hindquarter regions, combined
   with estimates of the timing of the female fertile phase, to assess how
   color varies with respect to this timing. We compare objective color
   measures (camera sensor responses) with models of rhesus vision (retinal
   receptor stimulation and visual discriminability). Due to differences in
   spectral separation between camera sensors and rhesus receptors, camera
   measures overestimated color variation and underestimated luminance
   variation compared with rhesus macaques. Consequently, objective digital
   camera measurements can produce statistically significant relationships
   that are probably undetectable to rhesus macaques, and hence
   biologically irrelevant, while missing variation in the measure that may
   be relevant. Discrimination modeling provided results that were most
   meaningful (as they were directly related to receiver perception) and
   were easiest to relate to underlying physiology. Further, this gave new
   insight into the function of such signals, revealing perceptually
   salient signal luminance changes outside of the fertile phase that could
   potentially enhance paternity confusion. Our study demonstrates how,
   even for species with similar visual systems to humans, models of vision
   may provide more accurate and meaningful information on the form and
   function of visual signals than objective color measures do.}},

Abstract = {{The disturbance vicariance hypothesis (DV) has been proposed to explain
   speciation in Amazonia, especially its edge regions, e.g. in eastern
   Guiana Shield harlequin frogs (Atelopus) which are suggested to have
   derived from a cool-adapted Andean ancestor. In concordance with DV
   predictions we studied that (i) these amphibians display a natural
   distribution gap in central Amazonia; (ii) east of this gap they
   constitute a monophyletic lineage which is nested within a
   pre-Andean/western clade; (iii) climate envelopes of Atelopus west and
   east of the distribution gap show some macroclimatic divergence due to a
   regional climate envelope shift; (iv) geographic distributions of
   climate envelopes of western and eastern Atelopus range into central
   Amazonia but with limited spatial overlap. We tested if presence and
   apparent absence data points of Atelopus were homogenously distributed
   with Ripley's K function. A molecular phylogeny (mitochondrial 16S rRNA
   gene) was reconstructed using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference
   to study if Guianan Atelopus constitute a clade nested within a larger
   genus phylogeny. We focused on climate envelope divergence and
   geographic distribution by computing climatic envelope models with
   MaxEnt based on macroscale bioclimatic parameters and testing them by
   using Schoener's index and modified Hellinger distance. We corroborated
   existing DV predictions and, for the first time, formulated new DV
   predictions aiming on species' climate envelope change. Our results
   suggest that cool-adapted Andean Atelopus ancestors had dispersed into
   the Amazon basin and further onto the eastern Guiana Shield where, under

Abstract = {{``Wicked{''} problems are those that are complex and that change when
   solutions are applied. Many conflicts in conservation fall into this
   category. The study approached the problem of how to constrain the
   apparent wickedness of a problem in the conservation management of a
   species by using simple empirical indicators to carry out iterative
   assessment of the risk to a population and to document how this risk
   evolves in relation to the addition of new data and the implementation
   of management actions. Effects of high levels of uncertainty within data
   and also concerning population structure were examined through
   stochastic simulation and by exploration of scenarios. Historical trends
   in the example used, the Steller sea lion, showed rapid declines in
   abundance in some regions during the 19805. The current total population
   is 130,000-150,000 Steller sea lions through Alaska and British Columbia
   and this number has been stable since about 1990 in spite of regional
   differences in population dynamics. Regional differences in the sequence
   of changes in the number of pups and non-pups, suggested that an
   internal re-distribution of juveniles could have happened between 1980
   and 1990. Current productivity also appears close to the long-term mean.
   Stochastic population projection using various scenarios showed that,
   based upon this history, the risk of extinction for the population has
   declined and is below reasonable thresholds for considering the
   population to be endangered. The trends in risk suggest that management
   actions taken since 1990 have probably been effective. Consequently, the
   conservation management objectives for the Steller sea lion are probably
   being met. The approach provides a mechanism, based upon experience and
   scenario analysis, for exploring future policy options and may help to
   constrain the debate amongst stakeholders about the cost-benefit
   trade-offs associated with different options. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Mountain streams provide important habitats for many species, but their
   faunas are especially vulnerable to climate change because of
   ectothermic physiologies and movements that are constrained to linear
   networks that are easily fragmented. Effectively conserving biodiversity
   in these systems requires accurate downscaling of climatic trends to
   local habitat conditions, but downscaling is difficult in complex
   terrains given diverse microclimates and mediation of stream heat
   budgets by local conditions. We compiled a stream temperature database
   (n = 780) for a 2500-km river network in central Idaho to assess
   possible trends in summer temperatures and thermal habitat for two
   native salmonid species from 1993 to 2006. New spatial statistical
   models that account for network topology were parameterized with these
   data and explained 93\% and 86\% of the variation in mean stream
   temperatures and maximas, respectively. During our study period, basin
   average mean stream temperatures increased by 0.38 degrees C (0.27
   degrees C/decade), and maximas increased by 0.48 degrees C (0.34 degrees
   C/decade), primarily due to long-term (30-50 year) trends in air
   temperatures and stream flows. Radiation increases from wildfires
   accounted for 9\% of basin-scale temperature increases, despite burning
   14\% of the basin. Within wildfire perimeters, however, stream
   temperature increases were 2-3 times greater than basin averages, and
   radiation gains accounted for 50\% of warming. Thermal habitat for
   rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was minimally affected by
   temperature increases, except for small shifts towards higher
   elevations. Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), in contrast, were
   estimated to have lost 11-20\% (8-16\%/decade) of the headwater stream
   lengths that were cold enough for spawning and early juvenile rearing,
   with the largest losses occurring in the coldest habitats. Our results
   suggest that a warming climate has begun to affect thermal conditions in
   streams and that impacts to biota will be specific to both species and
   context. Where species are at risk, conservation actions should be
   guided based on considerations of restoration opportunity and future
   climatic effects. To refine predictions based on thermal effects, more
   work is needed to understand mechanisms associated with biological
   responses, climate effects on other habitat features, and habitat
   configurations that confer population resilience.}},

Abstract = {{The urban wetlands of Bogota are ecosystems of great importance, yet
   they are deteriorating. The state of deterioration must be evaluated in
   order to develop new methods of ecosystem monitoring and conservation.
   Here we describe the development of an index to assess the ecological
   health of five urban wetlands and one rural wetland from limnological
   data. The field phase of this study took place in November 2007 (rainy
   season) and February 2008 (dry season). Physical and chemical variables
   of the wetland ecosystems (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH,
   conductivity, hardness, chlorides, ammonia, nitrites, nitrates,
   orthophosphates, and biological oxygen demand) were measured and samples
   of phytoplankton, periphyton, macroinvertebrates, and aquatic plants
   (macrophytes) were collected. The indices developed (biotic indices of
   communities: BI, and limnological conditions index: LICOI) allow
   classification of wetlands into three categories: those that have
   ``acceptable limnological conditions{''} (Meridor, Jaboque and
   Guaimaral), those with ``regular limnological conditions{''} (Santa
   Maria del Lago, Juan Amarillo) and those with ``poor limnological
   conditions{''} (Tibanica). None of the environments studied fit a
   potential fourth category of ``best limnological conditions.{''} The
   LICOI is a management tool that can be used to assess changes in
   wetlands after positive actions (restoration, cleaning, hydraulic
   management), or negative impacts (depletion, alien species, pollution).
   It also could allow regular monitoring of wetland evolution and serve as
   a basis for the development of indices measuring the ecological status

Abstract = {{Aim
   Habitat loss and climate change are two major drivers of biological
   diversity. Here we quantify how deforestation has already changed, and
   how future climate scenarios may change, environmental conditions within
   the highly disturbed Atlantic forests of Brazil. We also examine how
   environmental conditions have been altered within the range of selected
   bird species.
   Location
   Atlantic forests of south-eastern Brazil.
   Methods
   The historical distribution of 21 bird species was estimated using
   Maxent. After superimposing the present-day forest cover, we examined
   the environmental niches hypothesized to be occupied by these birds pre-
   and post-deforestation using environmental niche factor analysis (ENFA).
   ENFA was also used to compare conditions in the entire Atlantic forest
   ecosystem pre- and post-deforestation. The relative influence of land
   use and climate change on environmental conditions was examined using
   analysis of similarity and principal components analysis.
   Results
   Deforestation in the region has resulted in a decrease in suitable
   habitat of between 78\% and 93\% for the Atlantic forest birds included
   here. Further, Atlantic forest birds today experience generally wetter
   and less seasonal forest environments than they did historically. Models
   of future environmental conditions within forest remnants suggest
   generally warmer conditions and lower annual variation in rainfall due
   to greater precipitation in the driest quarter of the year. We found
   that deforestation resulted in a greater divergence of environmental
   conditions within Atlantic forests than that predicted by climate
   change.
   Main conclusions
   The changes in environmental conditions that have occurred with
   large-scale deforestation suggest that selective regimes may have
   shifted and, as a consequence, spatial patterns of intra-specific
   variation in morphology, behaviour and genes have probably been altered.
   Although the observed shifts in available environmental conditions
   resulting from deforestation are greater than those predicted by climate
   change, the latter will result in novel environments that exceed
   temperatures in any present-day climates and may lead to biotic
   attrition unless organisms can adapt to these warmer conditions.
   Conserving intra-specific diversity over the long term will require
   considering both how changes in the recent past have influenced
   contemporary populations and the impact of future environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Spatially explicit dynamic forest landscape models have been important
   tools to study large-scale forest landscape response under global
   climatic change. However, the quantification of relative importance of
   different transition pathways among different forest types to forest
   landscape dynamics stands as a significant challenge. In this study, we
   propose a novel approach of elasticity and loop analyses to identify
   important transition pathways contributing to forest landscape dynamics.
   The elasticity analysis calculates the elasticity to measure the
   importance of one-directional transitions (transition from one forest
   type directly to another forest type); while the loop analysis is
   employed to measure the importance of different circular transition
   pathways (transition from one forest type through other forest types
   back to itself). We apply the proposed approach to a spatially explicit
   dynamic model, LANDIS-II, in a study of forest landscape response to
   climatic change in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) incorporating
   the uncertainties in climatic change predictions. Our results not only
   corroborate the findings of the previous studies on the most likely
   future forest compositions under simulated climatic variability, but
   also, through the novel application of the elasticity and loop analyses
   concepts, provide a quantitative assessment of the specific mechanisms
   leading to particular forest compositions, some of which might remain
   undetected with conventional model evaluation methods. By quantifying
   the importance of specific processes (transitions among forest types) to
   forest composition dynamics, the proposed approach can be a valuable
   tool for a more quantitative understanding of the relationship between

   able to cause pelagic regime shifts in coastal areas and may cause the
   collapse of commercially important fish populations. Using
   microsatellites, developed for the first time in the phylum Ctenophora,
   we show that Mnemiopsis leidyi has colonized Eurasia from two source
   regions. Our preliminary data set included four sites within the
   putative source region (US East Coast and Gulf of Mexico) and 10 invaded
   locations in Eurasian waters. Bayesian clustering and phylogeographic
   approaches revealed the origin of earlier invasions of the Black and
   Caspian Sea in the 1980s/1990s within or close to the Gulf of Mexico,
   while the 2006 invasion of the North and Baltic Seas can be directly
   traced to New England (pairwise F-ST = 0). We found no evidence for
   mixing among both gene pools in the invaded areas. While the genetic
   diversity (allelic richness) remained similar in the Baltic Sea compared
   to the source region New England, it was reduced in the North Sea,
   supporting the view of an initial invasion of Northern Europe to a
   Baltic Sea port. In Black and Caspian Sea samples, we found a gradual
   decline in allelic richness compared to the Gulf of Mexico region,
   supporting a stepping-stone model of colonization with two sequential
   genetic founder events. Our data also suggest that current practices of
   ballast water treatment are insufficient to prevent repeated invasions

Abstract = {{Many different organisms, including the unicellular cyanobacterium
   Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, have a circadian clock. Advances in
   molecular biology and biochemistry are rapidly identifying and
   characterizing the components of the clock. However, its function inside
   the cell is not well understood, and the mechanism by which it affects
   fitness is unknown. This paper presents a simulation modeling study that
   combines existing systems biology models of basic intracellular
   mechanisms (e.g. DNA replication), photosynthesis, post-translational
   oscillator and transcriptional/translational feedback loop with an
   agent-based systems ecology model of individual cells (a new approach
   called ``systems bioecology{''}). The model is calibrated against and
   can reproduce the major observed features of the clock, including
   entrainment to light/dark (LD) cycles, free-running rhythms, phase
   shifts by dark pulses and KaiC protein dynamics. The observed decrease
   of the free-running period (FRP) with light intensity (Aschoff's Rule)
   emerges unexpectedly in the model. This behavior of the model can be
   eliminated by changing how the ribosome concentration varies with the
   growth rate, consistent with the observed behavior of an IdpA mutant,
   which suggests a role for that gene. The model predicts the observed
   fitness advantage of wild-type and period mutants when the FRP and LD
   periods match. The mechanism in the model is higher amplitude
   (resonance) of the clock, which leads to stronger expression of
   photosynthesis genes and growth rate. This may be the mechanism actually

Abstract = {{Although well-studied vertebrates such as the Northern Spotted Owl (NSO)
   are often used as focal species in regional conservation plans, range
   shifts associated with climate change may compromise this role. I used
   the Maxent (maximum entropy) method to develop NSO distribution models
   from data on NSO locations, forest age, and an ensemble of climate
   projections. NSO presence was positively associated with the proportion
   of old and mature forest at two spatial scales. Winter precipitation was
   the most important climate variable, consistent with previous studies
   suggesting negative effects on survival and recruitment. Model results
   suggest that initial niche expansion may be followed by a contraction as
   climate change intensifies, but this prediction is uncertain due to
   variability in predicted changes in precipitation between climate
   projections. Although new reserves created by the US Northwest Forest
   Plan prioritized areas with greater biological importance for the NSO
   than did pre-existing reserves, the latter areas, which lie
   predominantly at higher elevations, increase in importance under climate
   change. In contrast with previous analyses of the region's localized
   old-forest-associated species, vegetation rather than climate dominated
   NSO distribution models. Rigorous assessment of the implications of
   climate change for focal species requires development of dynamic
   vegetation models that incorporate effects of competitor species and
   altered disturbance regimes. The results suggest that, lacking such
   data, models that combine climate data with current data on habitat
   factors such as vegetation can inform conservation planning by providing
   less-biased estimates of potential range shifts than do niche models
   based on climate variables alone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{1855-1872}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Invasive plant species threaten native ecosystems, natural resources,
   and managed lands worldwide. Climate change may increase risk from
   invasive plant species as favorable climate conditions allow invaders to
   expand into new ranges. Here, we use bioclimatic envelope modeling to
   assess current climatic habitat, or lands climatically suitable for
   invasion, for three of the most dominant and aggressive invasive plants
   in the southeast United States: kudzu (Pueraria lobata), privet
   (Ligustrum sinense; L. vulgare), and cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica).
   We define climatic habitat using both the Maxent and Mahalanobis
   distance methodologies, and we define the best climatic predictors based
   on variables that best `constrain' species distributions and variables
   that `release' the most land area if excluded. We then use an ensemble
   of 12 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models to project changes in
   climatic habitat for the three invasive species by 2100. The combined
   methodologies, predictors, and models produce a robust assessment of
   invasion risk inclusive of many of the approaches typically used
   individually to assess climate change impacts. Current invasion risk is
   widespread in southeastern states for all three species, although
   cogongrass invasion risk is more restricted to the Gulf Coast. Climate
   change is likely to enable all three species to greatly expand their
   ranges. Risk from privet and kudzu expands north into Ohio,
   Pennsylvania, New York, and New England states by 2100. Risk from
   cogongrass expands as far north as Kentucky and Virginia. Heightened
   surveillance and prompt eradication of small pockets of invasion in
   northern states should be a management priority.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1860-1869}},

Abstract = {{The alteration of fresh and marine water cycling is likely to occur in
   coastal ecosystems as climate change causes the global redistribution of
   precipitation while simultaneously driving sea-level rise at a rate of
   2-3 mm yr-1. Here, we examined how precipitation alters the ecological
   effects of ocean water intrusion to coastal dunes on two oceanic
   carbonate islands in the Bahamas. The approach was to compare sites that
   receive high and low annual rainfall and are also characterized by
   seasonal distribution (wet and dry season) of precipitation. The spatial
   and temporal variations in precipitation serve as a proxy for conditions
   of altered precipitation which may occur via climate change. We used the
   natural abundances of stable isotopes to identify water sources (e.g.,
   precipitation, groundwater and ocean water) in the soil-plant continuum
   and modeled the depth of plant water uptake. Results indicated that
   decreased rainfall caused the shallow freshwater table on the dune
   ecosystem to sink and contract towards the inland, the lower freshwater
   head allowed ocean water to penetrate into the deeper soils, while
   shallow soils became exceedingly dry. Plants at the drier site that
   lived nearest to the ocean responded by taking up water from the deeper
   and consistently moist soil layers where ocean water intruded. Towards
   the inland, decreased rainfall caused the water table to sink to a depth
   that precluded both recharge to the upper soil layers and access by
   plants. Consequently, plants captured water in more shallow soils
   recharged by infrequent rainfall events. The results demonstrate dune
   ecosystems on oceanic islands are more susceptible to ocean water
   intrusion when annual precipitation decreases. Periods of diminished
   precipitation caused drought conditions, increased exposure to saline
   marine water and altered water-harvesting strategies. Quantifying
   species tolerances to ocean water intrusion and drought are necessary to
   determine a threshold of community sustainability.}},

Title = {{Cost distance modelling of landscape connectivity and gap-crossing
   ability using radio-tracking data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{603-610}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Landscape connectivity, the ability of species to move between
   different elements of a landscape, has been evaluated mainly by expert
   opinion, proxy data or homing experiments, all of which have major
   limitations. Cost distance modelling can overcome these limitations, but
   the resistance values of different landscape elements are difficult to
   estimate.
   2. Here, we present a novel method combining step selection functions
   with cost distance modelling to assess functional landscape
   connectivity. Instead of relying on movement metrics, the method uses a
   case-control design to assess whether the chosen steps differ from a
   random sample of alternatives of similar lengths. Alternative models of
   landscape connectivity and dispersal behaviour are represented as maps
   of resistance values, and compared using an information-theoretic
   approach to select those hypotheses that maximize the discrepancy
   between chosen steps and random alternatives.
   3. We applied this method to daily locations recorded along the
   dispersal paths of 38 juvenile North Island robins Petroica longipes in
   a fragmented pastoral landscape in New Zealand. We compared models with
   different resistance values for four recognized vegetation types in the
   landscape and assessed gap-crossing behaviour by changing the resistance
   value of pasture as a function of distance to the closest woody
   vegetation.
   4. Model comparison showed that juvenile robins move in decreasing order
   of preference through native forest, plantations and shrubland, and
   showed a marked reluctance for flying over pasture. Under the best
   model, the largest gap crossed was 110 m.
   5. Synthesis and applications. In combination with data on the total
   cost distances travelled by dispersers, cost distance models of
   landscape connectivity can be used to predict distributions of dispersal
   distances in any landscape with similar vegetation types. They can
   therefore predict responses of species to landscape management or
   predict spatial dynamics of populations following reintroduction. Our
   method is potentially applicable to any dispersal data, even with a
   relatively small number of locations recorded in complex landscapes,
   meaning models can be fitted to data that cannot be analysed using
   previous method. Tools are freely available for download to allow
   researchers and wildlife managers to apply our methods to their own
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Mountaintop removal and valley fill (MTR/VF) coal mining has altered the
   landscape of the Central Appalachian region in the USA. Among the
   changes are large-scale topographic recontouring, burial of headwater
   streams, and degradation of downstream water quality. The goals of our
   study were to: 1) compare the structure and function of natural and
   constructed stream channels in forested and MTR/VF catchments across
   ephemeral, intermittent, and perennial flow regimes and 2) assess the
   relationship between leaf litter breakdown and structural measures, such
   as the habitat assessments currently used by regulatory agencies.
   Specific conductance of stream water was, on average, 36 to 57x higher
   at perennial reaches below valley fills than at perennial reaches in
   forested catchments, whereas pH was circumneutral in both catchment
   types. Channel habitat and invertebrate assemblages in litter bags
   differed between forested streams and constructed channels in VF
   catchments. Invertebrate density, diversity, and biomass were typically
   higher in litter bags from forested catchments than from VF catchments.
   No differences in fungal biomass, estimated as ergosterol concentration,
   were detected between litter bags from forested and VF catchments.
   Breakdown of oak (Quercus alba) leaves was slower at perennial and
   intermittent reaches in VF catchments than at perennial and intermittent
   reaches in forested catchments. However, breakdown rates did not differ
   between ephemeral reaches on VFs and in forested catchments. Breakdown
   rates of oak leaves were significantly correlated to conductivity at
   perennial and intermittent reaches and to shredder diversity across all
   reaches, but were not correlated with habitat assessment scores
   currently being used to determine compensatory mitigation. Landuse
   changes associated with MTR/VF have detrimental consequences to
   headwater stream function that are not adequately evaluated using the
   prevalent habitat assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Standardized methods are required to measure ecosystem services in order

Abstract = {{Aim
   To demonstrate that multi-modelling methods have effectively been used
   to combine static species distribution models (SDM), predicting the
   geographical pattern of suitable habitat, with dynamic landscape and
   population models to forecast the impacts of environmental change on
   species' status, an important goal of conservation biogeography.
   Methods
   Three approaches were considered: (1) incorporating models of species
   migration to understand the ability of a species to occupy suitable
   habitat in new locations; (2) linking models of landscape disturbance
   and succession to models of habitat suitability; and (3) fully linking
   models of habitat suitability, habitat dynamics and spatially explicit
   population dynamics.
   Results
   Linking species-environment relationships, landscape dynamics and
   population dynamics in a multi-modelling framework allows the combined
   impacts of climate change (affecting species distribution and vital
   rates) and land cover dynamics (land use change, altered disturbance
   regimes) on species to be predicted. This approach is only feasible if
   the life history parameters and habitat requirements of the species are
   well understood.
   Main conclusions
   Forecasts of the impacts of global change on species may be improved by
   considering multiple causes. A range of methods are available to address
   the interactions of changing habitat suitability, habitat dynamics and

Abstract = {{Aim
   Climate change poses significant threats to biodiversity, including
   impacts on species distributions, abundance and ecological interactions.
   At a landscape scale, these impacts, and biotic responses such as
   adaptation and migration, will be mediated by spatial heterogeneity in
   climate and climate change. We examine several aspects of the geography
   of climate change and their significance for biodiversity conservation.
   Location
   California and Nevada, USA.
   Methods
   Using current climate surfaces (PRISM) and two scenarios of future
   climate (A1b, 2070-2099, warmer-drier and warmer-wetter), we mapped
   disappearing, declining, expanding and novel climates, and the velocity
   and direction of climate change in California and Nevada. We also
   examined fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in protected areas of the San
   Francisco Bay Area in relation to reserve size, topographic complexity
   and distance from the ocean.
   Results
   Under the two climate change scenarios, current climates across most of
   California and Nevada will shrink greatly in extent, and the climates of
   the highest peaks will disappear from this region. Expanding and novel
   climates are projected for the Central Valley. Current temperature
   isoclines are projected to move up to 4.9 km year-1 in flatter regions,
   but substantially slower in mountainous areas because of steep local
   topoclimate gradients. In the San Francisco Bay Area, climate diversity
   within currently protected areas increases with reserve size and
   proximity to the ocean (the latter because of strong coastal climate
   gradients). However, by 2100 of almost 500 protected areas (> 100 ha),
   only eight of the largest are projected to experience temperatures
   within their currently observed range. Topoclimate variability will
   further increase the range of conditions experienced and needs to be
   incorporated in future analyses.
   Main Conclusions
   Spatial heterogeneity in climate, from mesoclimate to topoclimate
   scales, represents an important spatial buffer in response to climate
   change, and merits increased attention in conservation planning.}},

Title = {{Niche partitioning and the effect of interspecific competition on

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Numerous interacting abiotic and biotic factors influence niche use
   and assemblage structure of freshwater fishes, but the strength of each
   factor changes with spatial scale. Few studies have examined the role of
   interspecific competition in structuring stream fish assemblages across
   spatial scales. We used field and laboratory approaches to examine
   microhabitat partitioning and the effect of interspecific competition on
   microhabitat use in two sympatric stream fishes (Galaxias `southern' and
   Galaxias gollumoides) at large (among streams and among sites within
   streams) and small (within artificial stream channels) spatial scales.
   2. Diurnal microhabitat partitioning and interspecific competition at
   large spatial scales were analysed among three sympatry streams (streams
   with allotopic and syntopic sites; three separate catchments) and four
   allopatry streams (streams with only allotopic sites; two separate
   catchments). Electro-fishing was used to sample habitat use of fishes at
   30 random points within each site by quantifying four variables for each
   individual: water velocity, depth, distance to nearest cover and
   substratum size. Habitat availability was then quantified for each site
   by measuring those variables at each of 50 random points. Diet and
   stable isotope partitioning was analysed from syntopic sites only. Diel
   cycles of microhabitat use and interspecific competition at small
   spatial scales were examined by monitoring water velocity use over 48 h
   in artificial stream channels for three treatments: (i) allopatric G.
   `southern' (10 G. `southern'); (ii) allopatric G. gollumoides (10 G.
   gollumoides) and (iii) sympatry (five individuals of each species).
   3. One hundred and ninety-four G. `southern' and 239 G. gollumoides were
   sampled across all seven streams, and habitat availability between the
   two species was similar among all sites. Galaxias `southern' utilised
   faster water velocities than G. gollumoides in both the field and in
   channel experiments. Both species utilised faster water velocities in
   channels at night than during the day. Diet differences were observed
   and were supported by isotopic differences (two of three sites). No
   interspecific differences were observed for the other three microhabitat
   variables in the field, and multivariate habitat selection did not
   differ between species. Interspecific competition had no effect on
   microhabitat use of either species against any variable either in the
   field (large scale) or in channels (small scale).
   4. The results suggest that niche partitioning occurs along a subset of
   microhabitat variables (water velocity use and diet). Interspecific
   competition does not appear to be a major biotic factor controlling
   microhabitat use by these sympatric taxa at any spatial scale. The
   results further suggest that stream fish assemblages are not primarily
   structured by biotic factors, reinforcing other studies de-emphasising
   interspecific competition.}},

Abstract = {{1. The efficacy of leaf-litter decomposition, sediment respiration,
   biofilm biomass, growth, chlorophyll a concentration and the autotrophic
   index (biofilm ash-free dry mass/chlorophyll a) and fungal biomass for
   detecting human-induced change was evaluated using 24 references and 15
   disturbed stream sites located in central Portugal.
   2. Decomposition rates of alder (Alnus glutinosa) and oak (Quercus
   robur) leaves and sediment respiration rates were effective in
   discriminating impairment. Decomposition was negatively correlated with
   abiotic factors, such as ammonium and nitrite concentrations,
   connectivity and alterations in the hydrological regime, and positively
   correlated with nitrate concentration and oxygen concentration. Sediment
   respiration rates were correlated with organic contamination, land use
   and morphological changes.
   3. Growth rates of biofilm, concentration of chlorophyll a and the
   autotrophic index, although 41-73\% higher at disturbed compared to
   reference sites, were not significantly different. These three variables
   were significantly correlated with total organic carbon, oxygen
   concentration, pH, nitrite and the presence of dams. Fungal biomass on
   leaves and biofilm biomass on natural substrata did not differ between
   reference and disturbed sites.
   4. Our findings lend support to the use of functional variables like
   decomposition and sediment respiration in monitoring and when used
   together with structural variables should give a more holistic measure

Abstract = {{We present a new synthesis, based on a suite of complementary
   approaches, of the primary production and carbon sink in forests of the
   25 member states of the European Union (EU-25) during 1990-2005.
   Upscaled terrestrial observations and model-based approaches agree
   within 25\% on the mean net primary production (NPP) of forests, i.e.
   520 +/- 75 g C m-2 yr-1 over a forest area of 1.32 x 106 km2 to 1.55 x
   106 km2 (EU-25). New estimates of the mean long-term carbon forest sink
   (net biome production, NBP) of EU-25 forests amounts 75 +/- 20 g C m-2
   yr-1. The ratio of NBP to NPP is 0.15 +/- 0.05. Estimates of the fate of
   the carbon inputs via NPP in wood harvests, forest fires, losses to
   lakes and rivers and heterotrophic respiration remain uncertain, which
   explains the considerable uncertainty of NBP. Inventory-based
   assessments and assumptions suggest that 29 +/- 15\% of the NBP (i.e.,
   22 g C m-2 yr-1) is sequestered in the forest soil, but large
   uncertainty remains concerning the drivers and future of the soil
   organic carbon. The remaining 71 +/- 15\% of the NBP (i.e., 53 g C m-2
   yr-1) is realized as woody biomass increments. In the EU-25, the
   relatively large forest NBP is thought to be the result of a sustained
   difference between NPP, which increased during the past decades, and
   carbon losses primarily by harvest and heterotrophic respiration, which
   increased less over the same period.}},

Abstract = {{Whitefish, genus Coregonus, show exceptional levels of phenotypic
   diversity with sympatric morphs occurring in numerous postglacial lakes
   in the northern hemisphere. Here, we studied the effects of
   human-induced eutrophication on sympatric whitefish morphs in the Swiss
   lake, Lake Thun. In particular, we addressed the questions whether
   eutrophication (i) induced hybridization between two ecologically
   divergent summer-spawning morphs through a loss of environmental
   heterogeneity, and (ii) induced rapid adaptive morphological changes
   through changes in the food web structure. Genetic analysis based on 11
   microsatellite loci of 282 spawners revealed that the pelagic and the
   benthic morph represent highly distinct gene pools occurring at
   different relative proportions on all seven known spawning sites. Gill
   raker counts, a highly heritable trait, showed nearly discrete
   distributions for the two morphs. Multilocus genotypes characteristic of
   the pelagic morph had more gill rakers than genotypes characteristic of
   benthic morph. Using Bayesian methods, we found indications of recent
   but limited introgressive hybridization. Comparisons with historical
   gill raker data yielded median evolutionary rates of 0.24 haldanes and
   median selection intensities of 0.27 for this trait in both morphs for
   1948-2004 suggesting rapid evolution through directional selection at
   this trait. However, phenotypic plasticity as an alternative explanation
   for this phenotypic change cannot be discarded. We hypothesize that both
   the temporal shifts in mean gill raker counts and the recent
   hybridization reflect responses to changes in the trophic state of the
   lake induced by pollution in the 1960s, which created novel selection
   pressures with respect to feeding niches and spawning site preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Question
   Can spatial analytical techniques be used to extract quantitative
   measurements of vegetation communities from ground-based permanent
   photo-point images?
   Location
   Mount Aspiring National Park, south-western South Island, New Zealand.
   Methods
   Sets of ground-based photographs representing two contrasting vegetation
   types were selected to test two spatial analytical techniques. In the
   grid technique, a grid was superimposed onto the photographs and the
   frequency of species presence in each grid-square was calculated to
   estimate species abundance/cover over the defined area. In the
   object-oriented technique, the photographs were segmented into
   meaningful objects, based on the colour of the pixels and the textural
   patterns of the images, and the area occupied by an object in the image
   was used to derive species abundance/cover over the area.
   Results
   Both techniques allow quick and easy classification of digital elements
   into ecologically relevant categories of vegetation components. The grid
   technique appeared more robust, being quick and efficient, accommodating
   all image types and providing presence/absence matrices for multivariate
   analysis. Fewer classes were identified using the object-oriented
   technique, in particular for the forest interior site and for small
   individual plants such as Astelia spp.
   Conclusions
   Both techniques showed potential for the objective quantitative analysis
   of long-term vegetation monitoring of cover and changes of several
   component species, using repeat ground-based photographs more
   specifically for grassland habitats. However, both rely to various
   degrees on manual classification. Corrective factors and strict
   protocols for taking the photographs are necessary to account for
   variation in view angles and to compute values more representative of
   absolute species abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Rapidly changing land use in Southeast Asia threatens plant diversity,
   and reduces the time we have left to document it. Despite over 200 years
   of scientific plant exploration, many plant species have yet to be
   discovered. Moreover, we still have a very poor understanding of the
   distribution of known taxa in this biogeographically complex region. We
   review the current state of biodiversity exploration, using plants in
   Indonesia as an example. Traditional methods of collecting and
   describing species have provided a solid foundation for our
   understanding of plant biodiversity, but are insufficient for the
   pragmatic task of rapidly discovering and documenting today's
   biodiversity before it is gone, because general collecting expeditions
   tend to be infrequent, and documentation of most new species must await
   taxonomic revisions many years in the future. Solutions to this
   exploration and documentation crisis (i) could use the abundant resource
   of enthusiastic, networked, national biology students, (ii) should
   employ biodiversity informatics tools to efficiently engage both
   specialists and parataxonomists, and (iii) might require adoption of new
   types of alpha-taxonomy, utilizing increasingly low-cost molecular
   methods and high resolution photographs. We describe emerging
   technologies that will facilitate this taxonomic development. We believe
   that a new golden age of biodiversity exploration may be dawning, just
   as biodiversity itself is most threatened, and are hopeful that
   increasing knowledge of biodiversity will be a positive force to slow
   its loss.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem rehabilitation strategies are grounded in the concept that
   coexisting species fit their environments as an outcome of natural
   selection operating over ecological and evolutionary timescales. From
   this perspective, re-creation of historical environmental filters on
   community assembly is a necessary first step to recovering biodiversity
   within degraded ecosystems; however, this approach is often not feasible
   in severely damaged environments where extensive physiochemical changes
   cannot be reversed. Under such circumstances management goals may shift
   from restoring historical conditions to reconstructing entirely new
   ecosystems or replicating natural ecosystems that may be locally novel
   but of regional conservation importance. This latter goal may be
   achieved by introducing to damaged sites species already adapted to
   filters maintaining the degraded state, through targeting assemblages
   from natural ecosystems biophysically analogous to the degraded state,
   here termed ``degraded-state analogue{''} (DSA) ecosystems. This
   hypothesis predicts that, in high-stress sites where recruitment of
   previous inhabitants is strongly microsite-limited, DSA species will be
   primarily propagule-limited; furthermore, communities invaded by DSA
   species should shift in structure to reflect properties associated with
   high-value DSA target ecosystems.
   We tested these predictions by experimentally sowing long-abandoned
   limestone quarry floors with 18 perennial grass and forb species
   characteristic of rare natural limestone pavements called ``alvars.{''}
   Alvar species established successfully under a range of microsite
   conditions manipulated to alter suspected constraints on colonization,
   including nitrogen deficiency, excessive CaCO(3). and competition with
   weeds. Alvar species performed equivalently to seeded weed species known
   to thrive on quarry floors. Resident communities doubled in species
   richness following alvar species addition, supporting 17-20 species/0.18
   m(2) (95\% confidence interval) and providing refuge to regionally
   restricted or threatened species including Iris lacustris Solidago
   ptarmicoides. and Liatris cylindracea. In contrast, maximum-diversity
   reference plots on a pristine alvar supported 20-23 species/0.18m(2).
   Strong propagule limitation but weak microsite constraints on quarry
   colonization by alvar species combined with establishment of
   species-rich communities comparable to natural alvar biodiversity hot
   spots confirms that targeting DSA assemblages in ecosystem
   reconstruction can promote both efficient site colonization and ex situ

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Contradictions between system-specific evidence and broader paradigms to
   explain ecosystem behavior present a challenge for natural resource
   management. In Florida (USA) springs, increasing nitrate (NO3-)
   concentrations have been implicated as the cause of algal overgrowth via
   alleviation of N-limitation. As such, policy and management efforts have
   centered heavily on reduction of nitrogen (N) loads. While the
   N-limitation hypothesis appears well founded on broadly supported
   aquatic eutrophication models, several observations from Florida springs
   are inconsistent with this hypothesis in its present simplified form.
   First, NO3- concentration is not correlated with algal abundance across
   the broad population of springs and is weakly negatively correlated with
   primary productivity. Second, within individual spring runs, algal mats
   are largely confined to the headwater reaches within 250 m of spring
   vents, while elevated NO3- concentrations persist for several kilometers
   or more. Third, historic observations suggest that establishment of
   macroalgal mats often lags behind observed increases in NO3- by more
   than a decade. Fourth, although microcosm experiments indicate high
   thresholds for N-limitation of algae, experiments in situ have
   demonstrated only minimal response to N enrichment. These muted
   responses may reflect large nutrient fluxes in springs, which were
   sufficient to satisfy present demand even at historic concentrations.
   New analyses of existing data indicate that dissolved oxygen (DO) has
   declined dramatically in many Florida springs over the past 30 years,
   and that DO and grazer abundance are better predictors or algal
   abundance in springs than are nutrient concentrations. Although a
   precautionary N-reduction strategy for Florida springs is warranted
   given demonstrable effects or nutrient enrichment in a broad suite of
   aquatic systems worldwide, the DO grazer hypothesis and other potential
   mechanisms merit increased scientific scrutiny. This case study
   illustrates the importance of an adaptive approach that explicitly
   evaluates paradigms as hypotheses and actively seeks alternative
   explanations.}},

Abstract = {{Rural areas are subject to changing and often competing demands. Where
   agricultural production was once paramount, it now competes with other
   ecosystem services such as carbon storage, rural amenity, and wildlife
   habitat. If rural areas are to be managed to produce this broad range of
   goods and services, then more diverse and complex management regimes are
   needed. This paper explores the literature on property rights before
   using a `property rights bundle' approach in the UK uplands to (1)
   examine the distribution of property rights between stakeholders in a
   multi-resource system and (2) evaluate the effect of state intervention
   on the redistribution of property rights and the resulting management
   regimes. Private land owners were found to be the dominant type of
   property rights holder and private property the dominant management
   regime in the uplands of the UK. Government intervention has also
   created private-state regimes for some public goods such as biodiversity
   but common property management is still in its infancy with regards to
   ecosystem services and few stakeholders have claimant rights over
   resources. As a result, many stakeholders are unable to influence
   management to produce the goods that they want. A property rights
   perspective highlights that single management regimes alone are unlikely
   to manage land sustainably for both private and public goods. Instead, a
   complex mix of private, private-state and common property regimes are
   found to be emerging in this multi-resource system. These mixed
   management regimes have the potential to produce sustainable outcomes
   but only if the appropriate management regime is matched to each
   resource, if links are developed between each regime to deal with
   conflict and if mixed management is adaptable enough to cope with new
   and changing demands. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses the poorly explored issue of the control of false
   positive rate (FPR) in the mapping of pair-wise epistatic quantitative
   trait loci (QTL). A nested test framework was developed to (1) allow
   pre-identified QTL to be used directly to detect epistasis in
   one-dimensional genome scans, (2) to detect novel epistatic QTL pairs in
   two-dimensional genome scans and (3) to derive genome-wide thresholds
   through permutation and handle multiple testing. We used large-scale
   simulations to evaluate the performance of both the one-and
   two-dimensional approaches in mapping different forms and levels of
   epistasis and to generate profiles of FPR, power and accuracy to inform
   epistasis mapping studies. We showed that the nested test framework and
   genome-wide thresholds were essential to control FPR at the 5\% level.
   The one-dimensional approach was generally more powerful than the
   two-dimensional approach in detecting QTL-associated epistasis and
   identified nearly all epistatic pairs detected from the two-dimensional
   approach. However, only the two-dimensional approach could detect
   epistatic QTL with weak main effects. Combining the two approaches
   allowed effective mapping of different forms of epistasis, whereas using
   the nested test framework kept the FPR under control. This approach
   provides a good search engine for high-throughput epistasis analyses.

Abstract = {{Question
   Community ecologists are often confronted with multiple possible
   partitions of a single set of records of species composition and/or
   abundances from several sites. Different methods of numerical
   classification produce different results, and the question is which of
   them, and how many clusters, should be selected for interpretation. We
   demonstrate a new method for identifying the optimal partition from a
   series of partitions of the same set of sites, based on number of
   species with high fidelity to clusters in a partition (faithful
   species).
   Methods
   The new method, OptimClass, has two variants. OptimClass 1 searches the
   partition with the maximum number of faithful species across all
   clusters, while OptimClass 2 searches the partition with the maximum
   number of clusters that contain at least a preselected minimum number of
   faithful species. Faithful species are determined based on the P value
   of the Fisher's exact test, as a measure of fidelity. OptimClass was
   tested on three vegetation datasets that varied in species richness and
   internal heterogeneity, using several classification algorithms,
   resemblance measures and cover transformations.
   Results
   Results from both variants of OptimClass depended on the preselected
   threshold P value for faithful species: higher P gave higher probability
   that a partition with more clusters was selected as optimal. Good
   partitions, in terms of OptimClass criteria, involved flexible beta
   clustering, and also ordinal clustering. Good partitions were also
   obtained with TWINSPAN when the required number of clusters was small,
   or UPGMA when the required number of clusters was large. Poor partitions
   usually resulted from classifications that used resemblance measures and
   cover transformations emphasizing differences in species cover; this is
   not unexpected because OptimClass uses a presence/absence-based fidelity
   measure.
   Conclusions
   If the aim of a classification is to obtain clusters rich in faithful
   species, which can be subsequently used as diagnostic species for
   identification of community types, OptimClass is a suitable method for
   simultaneous choice of the optimal classification algorithm and optimal
   number of clusters. It can be computed in the JUICE program.}},

Abstract = {{Ecologists carry a well-stocked toolbox with a great variety of sampling
   methods, statistical analyses and modelling tools, and new methods are
   constantly appearing. Evaluation and optimisation of these methods is
   crucial to guide methodological choices. Simulating error-free data or
   taking high-quality data to qualify methods is common practice. Here, we
   emphasise the methodology of the `virtual ecologist' (VE) approach where
   simulated data and observer models are used to mimic real species and
   how they are `virtually' observed. This virtual data is then subjected
   to statistical analyses and modelling, and the results are evaluated
   against the `true' simulated data. The VE approach is an intuitive and
   powerful evaluation framework that allows a quality assessment of
   sampling protocols, analyses and modelling tools. It works under
   controlled conditions as well as under consideration of confounding
   factors such as animal movement and biased observer behaviour. In this
   review, we promote the approach as a rigorous research tool, and
   demonstrate its capabilities and practical relevance. We explore past
   uses of VE in different ecological research fields, where it mainly has
   been used to test and improve sampling regimes as well as for testing
   and comparing models, for example species distribution models. We
   discuss its benefits as well as potential limitations, and provide some
   practical considerations for designing VE studies. Finally, research
   fields are identified for which the approach could be useful in the
   future. We conclude that VE could foster the integration of theoretical
   and empirical work and stimulate work that goes far beyond sampling
   methods, leading to new questions, theories, and better mechanistic
   understanding of ecological systems.}},

Abstract = {{Recent climate change predictions suggest altered patterns of winter
   precipitation across the Arctic. It has been suggested that the
   presence, timing and quantity of snow all affect microbial activity,
   thus influencing CO2 production in soil. In this study annual and
   seasonal emissions of CO2 were estimated in High-Arctic Adventdalen,
   Svalbard, and sub-Arctic Latnjajaure, Sweden, using a new trace
   gas-based method to track real-time diffusion rates through the snow.
   Summer measurements from snow-free soils were made using a chamber-based
   method. Measurements were obtained from different snow regimes in order
   to evaluate the effect of snow depth on winter CO2 effluxes. Total
   annual emissions of CO2 from the sub-Arctic site (0.662-1.487 kg CO2 m-2
   yr-1) were found to be more than double the emissions from the
   High-Arctic site (0.369-0.591 kg CO2 m-2 yr-1). There were no
   significant differences in winter effluxes between snow regimes or
   vegetation types, indicating that spatial variability in winter soil CO2
   effluxes are not directly linked to snow cover thickness or soil
   temperatures. Total winter emissions (0.004-0.248 kg CO2 m-2) were found
   to be in the lower range of those previously described in the
   literature. Winter emissions varied in their contribution to total
   annual production between 1 and 18\%. Artificial snow drifts shortened
   the snow-free period by 2 weeks and decreased the annual CO2 emission by
   up to 20\%. This study suggests that future shifts in vegetation zones
   may increase soil respiration from Arctic tundra regions.}},

Abstract = {{The largest perturbation on upper trophic levels of many marine
   ecosystems stems from fishing. The reaction of the ecosystem goes beyond
   the trophic levels directly targeted by the fishery. This reaction has
   been described either as a change in slope of the overall size spectrum

   we use a novel size- and trait-based model to explore how marine
   ecosystems might react to perturbations from different types of fishing
   pressure. The model explicitly resolves the whole life history of fish,
   from larvae to adults. The results show that fishing does not change the
   overall slope of the size spectrum, but depletes the largest individuals
   and induces trophic cascades. A trophic cascade can propagate both up
   and down in trophic levels driven by a combination of changes in
   predation mortality and food limitation. The cascade is damped as it
   comes further away from the perturbed trophic level. Fishing on several
   trophic levels leads to a disappearance of the signature of the trophic
   cascade. Differences in fishing patterns among ecosystems might
   influence whether a trophic cascade is observed.}},

Abstract = {{Declining ocean health, increasing human demands on marine ecosystems,
   and a history of management focused on individual activities, species or
   sectors has led to calls for more comprehensive, integrated management
   that considers entire coupled social-ecological systems. This transition
   to ecosystem-based management (EBM) for the oceans will certainly face a
   number of hurdles, and many practitioners struggle with how to move
   forward with EBM. In this paper, we assess whether the necessary science
   exists to support EBM. Specifically, we evaluate the state of the social
   and natural sciences for three research areas that are critical to EBM:
   (1) ecosystem services, (2) cumulative impacts, and (3) ecosystem
   variability and change. For each of the three research areas, we
   describe its importance to EBM and assess existing and emerging
   information and application of this knowledge, focusing on the US West
   Coast. We conclude that available science is not the bottleneck for
   moving forward with comprehensive EBM for this region, although we
   highlight important remaining knowledge gaps, particularly within the
   social sciences. Given imperfect and uncertain knowledge, EBM calls for
   an adaptive management approach, starting with readily available
   information, and continuously adapting as new information emerges. This
   synthesis can serve as a basis for comparison for other regions; it
   provides guidance for organizing information in support of EBM and
   outlines many novel and broadly applicable scientific approaches. (C)

Abstract = {{To preserve populations of endangered bee species, sound knowledge of
   their maximum foraging distance between nest and host plants is crucial.
   Previous investigations predicted maximum foraging distances of 100-200
   m for small bee species and up to 1100 m for very large species based on
   mainly indirect methods. The present study applied a new and direct
   approach to experimentally investigate maximum foraging distances in
   solitary bees. One endangered and two common species of different body
   sizes, all of which restrict pollen foraging to a single plant genus,
   were established in a landscape lacking their specific host plants.
   Females were forced to collect pollen on potted host plants that were
   successively placed in increasing distance from fixed nesting stands.
   The maximum foraging distance recorded for the small Hylaeus
   punctulatissimus was 1100 m, for the medium sized Chelostoma rapunculi
   1275 m and for the large Hoplitis adunca 1400 m, indicating that maximum
   foraging distances at species level have been underestimated. However,
   the capability to use resources on such a large spatial scale applied
   only to a small percentage of individuals as 50\% of the females of H.
   punctulatissimus and H. adunca did not forage at distances longer than
   100-225 m and 300 m, respectively. This finding suggests that a close
   neighbourhood of nesting and foraging habitat within few hundred meters
   is crucial to maintain populations of these species, and that threshold
   distances at which half of the population discontinues foraging are a
   more meaningful parameter for conservation practice than the species
   specific maximum foraging distances. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{60-68}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses effects of trophic complexity on basal species, in
   a Lotka-Volterra model with stochasticity. We use simple food web
   modules, with three trophic levels, and expose every species to random
   environmental stochasticity and analyze (1) the effect of the position
   of strong trophic interactions on temporal fluctuations in basal
   species' abundances and (2) the relationship between fluctuation
   patterns and extinction risk. First, the numerical simulations showed
   that basal species do not simply track the environment, i.e. species
   dynamics do not simply mirror the characteristics of the applied
   environmental stochasticity. Second, the extinction risk of species was
   related to the fluctuation patterns of the species.
   More specifically, we show (i) that despite being forced by random
   stochasticity without temporal autocorrelation (i.e. white noise), there
   is significant temporal autocorrelation in the time series of all basal
   species' abundances (i.e. the spectra of basal species are red-shifted),
   (ii) the degree of temporal autocorrelation in basal species time series
   is affected by food web structure and (iii) the degree of temporal
   autocorrelation tend to be correlated to the extinction risks of basal
   species.
   Our results emphasize the role of food web structure and species
   interactions in modifying the response of species to environmental
   variability. To shed some light on the mechanisms we compare the
   observed pattern in abundances of basal species with analytically
   predicted patterns and show that the change in the predicted pattern due
   to the addition of strong trophic interactions is correlated to the
   extinction risk of the basal species. We conclude that much remain to be
   understood about the mechanisms behind the interaction among
   environmental variability, species interactions, population dynamics and
   vulnerability before we quantitatively can predict, for example, effects
   of climate change on species and ecological communities. Here, however,
   we point out a new possible approach for identifying species that are
   vulnerable to environmental stochasticity by checking the degree of
   temporal autocorrelation in the time series of species. Increased
   autocorrelation in population fluctuations can be an indication of
   increased extinction risk. (C) 2009 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.}},

   contribution of J-NABS to developments in assessment of ecological
   integrity. A total of 225 bioassessment articles were published in
   J-NABS from 1986 to 2007 This total was similar to 1/2 of the number of

   Biology (FWB, another leading freshwater journal used for comparison),

   growing interest in the topic and the delay (similar to 30 y since the
   Clean Water Act) of scientific action in response to water legislation
   Taxonomic composition and multivariate techniques, multimetric indices,
   lotic systems, macroinvertebrates, land use, and overall human impacts
   were major themes in J-NABS bioassessment articles. Progress in
   bioassessment is needed in 3 main areas First, bioassessments done at
   large spatial scales are needed to meet requirements of new
   environmental policies Second, bioassessment should shift from
   consideration of taxon losses to losses of ecological functions Third,
   statistical techniques are needed for predictive assessment of deviation
   in ecological integrity between expected (natural) and observed (natural
   or impacted) conditions. Assessment of functional integrity based on
   multiple traits is a promising area because biological traits represent
   universal biological characteristics that are connected to ecosystem
   functions However, the relationships between ecophysiological traits of
   individuals and ecosystem-scale responses must be properly defined for
   specific types of human impairment, and utility of the approach for

   density, campground size and usage, distance from the core infested
   zone, wood products industry size and type of wood usage, and human
   population density. With the ``insect flight{''} model, probability of
   movement is dependent on EAB abundance in the source cells, the quantity
   of ash in the target cells, and the distances between them. With the
   ``insect-ride{''} model, we modify the value related to ash abundance
   based on factors related to potential human-assisted movements of
   EAB-infested ash wood or just hitchhiking insects. We attempt to show
   the advantage of our model compared to statistical approaches and to
   justify its practical value to field managers working with imperfect
   knowledge. We stress the importance of the road network in distributing
   insects to new geographically dispersed sites in Ohio, where 84\% were
   within 1 km of a major highway.}},

Title = {{A new method for detecting and interpreting biodiversity and ecological
   community thresholds}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-37}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Existing methods for identifying ecological community thresholds are
   designed for univariate indicators or multivariate dimension-reduction
   of community structure. Most are insensitive to responses of individual
   taxa with low occurrence frequencies or highly variable abundances,
   properties of the vast majority of taxa in community data sets. We
   introduce Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) to detect changes in
   taxa distributions along an environmental gradient over space or time,
   and assess synchrony among taxa change points as evidence for community
   thresholds.
   2. TITAN uses indicator species scores to integrate occurrence,
   abundance and directionality of taxa responses. It identifies the
   optimum value of a continuous variable, x, that partitions sample units
   while maximizing taxon-specific scores. Indicator z scores standardize
   original scores relative to the mean and SD of permuted samples along x,
   thereby emphasizing the relative magnitude of change and increasing the
   contributions of taxa with low occurrence frequencies but high
   sensitivity to the gradient. TITAN distinguishes negative (z-) and
   positive (z+) taxa responses and tracks cumulative responses of
   declining {[}sum(z-)] and increasing {[}sum(z+)] taxa in the community.
   Bootstrapping is used to estimate indicator reliability and purity as
   well as uncertainty around the location of individual taxa and community
   change points.
   3. Using two simulated data sets, TITAN correctly identified taxon and
   community thresholds in more than 99\% of 500 unique versions of each
   simulation. In contrast, multivariate change-point analysis did not
   distinguish directional taxa responses, resulting in much wider
   confidence intervals that in one instance failed to capture thresholds
   in 38\% of the iterations.
   4. Retrospective analysis of macroinvertebrate community response to a
   phosphorus gradient supported previous threshold estimates, although
   TITAN produced narrower confidence limits and revealed that several taxa
   declined at lower levels of phosphorus. Re-analysis of macroinvertebrate
   responses to an urbanization gradient illustrated disparate change
   points for declining (0.81-3.3\% urban land) and increasing (6.8-26.6\%)
   taxa, whereas the published threshold estimate (20-30\%) missed the
   declining-taxa threshold because it could not distinguish their
   synchronous decline from the gradual increase in ubiquitous taxa.
   5. Synthesis and applications. By deconstructing communities to assess
   synchrony of taxon-specific change points, TITAN provides a sensitive
   and precise alternative to existing methods for assessing community
   thresholds. TITAN has tremendous potential to inform conservation of
   rare or threatened species, develop species sensitivity models, identify
   reference conditions and to support development of numerical regulatory
   criteria.}},

Abstract = {{1. Certain classes of change in the characteristics of an ecosystem,
   labelled regime shifts, have been observed in marine and freshwater
   ecosystems world-wide. Few tools, however, have been offered to detect
   and identify regime shifts in time-series data.
   2. We use a novel approach based on tools taken from the world of
   statistics, and econometrics to examine the occurrence of a regime shift
   in the predatory zooplankton population of Lake Kinneret, Israel. The
   tools are a free-knot spline mean function estimation method and a
   Markov-switching vector autoregression model.
   3. Our approach detected, with high probability, the occurrence of a
   regime shift in the zooplankton population in the early to mid-1990s.
   This was in-line with expectations based on similar events observed in
   the lake.
   4. The suggested approach is a step forward from existing approaches in
   that it does not require any pre-determent of threshold values but
   rather relies on a hidden underlying stochastic process that yields
   probabilities of regime shifts. Thus, it can therefore be applied
   without introducing any prior biases into the analysis. The approach is,
   therefore, an objective method in detecting the likely occurrence of a
   regime shift.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 100 years, Arctic temperatures have increased at almost
   twice the global average rate. One consequence is the acceleration of
   glacier retreat, exposing new habitats that are colonized by
   microorganisms whose diversity and function are unknown. Here, we
   characterized bacterial diversity along two approximately parallel
   chronosequences in an Arctic glacier forefield that span six time points
   following glacier retreat. We assessed changes in phylotype richness,
   evenness and turnover rate through the analysis of 16S rRNA gene
   sequences recovered from 52 samples taken from surface layers along the
   chronosequences. An average of 4500 sequences was obtained from each
   sample by 454 pyrosequencing. Using parametric methods, it was estimated
   that bacterial phylotype richness was high, and that it increased
   significantly from an average of 4000 (at a threshold of 97\% sequence
   similarity) at locations exposed for 5 years to an average of 7050
   phylotypes per 0.5 g of soil at sites that had been exposed for 150
   years. Phylotype evenness also increased over time, with an evenness of
   0.74 for 150 years since glacier retreat reflecting large proportions of
   rare phylotypes. The bacterial species turnover rate was especially high
   between sites exposed for 5 and 19 years. The level of bacterial
   diversity present in this High Arctic glacier foreland was comparable
   with that found in temperate and tropical soils, raising the question
   whether global patterns of bacterial species diversity parallel that of
   plants and animals, which have been found to form a latitudinal gradient
   and be lower in polar regions compared with the tropics.}},

Abstract = {{There is general agreement in literature that Alpine vegetation belt
   ecotones have shown a trend of upward migration in the last few decades.
   Despite the potential of such shifts as indicators of global change
   effects in mountain ecosystems, there are relatively few works focused
   on their assessment in a systematic and spatially explicit way. In this
   work our aim is to quantify the altitudinal shifts and analyse the
   spatial pattern dynamics of mountain ecotones. We developed a novel
   procedure to delineate the current and former state of three
   characteristic mountain ecotones, which we formalised as forest, tree
   and tundra lines. Our approach is based on the recognition of
   altitudinal extreme outposts identified with ecotone locations at a
   slope scale. The integration of multi-temporal datasets allows the
   identification and quantification of altitudinal advances and retreats
   in the outpost locations for a given period. We tested the method in a
   section of the Italian Alps for the period 1957-2003. Results show a
   general trend of an increase in altitude for the three ecotones, despite
   the occurrence of occasional decreases. We estimate decadal altitude
   increments of 25 m for forest line, 13 m for treeline and 11 m for
   tundra line. We also identified changes in ecotone spatial morphology
   between the two dates, with significant implications in connectivity and
   colonisation dynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{810-819}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Sustainability and welfare assessment is a contemporary theme of major
   scientific and policy relevance, requiring the consideration of multiple
   dimensions and diverse perspectives. The economic approach to
   sustainability and welfare assessment has frequently relied on
   alternatives, or adjustments, to GDP, widely used as an indicator of
   macroeconomic performance.
   Several authors have proposed alternative indicators, such as the ISEW,
   which intend to measure sustainability and economic welfare in a way
   that avoids the limitations of GDP: namely accounting for the value of
   externalities, the distribution of income and natural resources
   depiction. Since Daly and Cobb (1989) there have been proposed
   improvements to the ISEW, however, its aptitude to represent a sound
   alternative to GDP is still the subject of scientific debate.
   This paper presents a new approach to the ISEW (named Modified ISEW),
   including new components and methodological changes for the estimation
   of the index. These have the purpose of avoiding some of the index
   shortcomings and allow for a direct comparison with the GDP, which are
   advantages over previous studies.
   An application is developed for the US case, taking advantage of wide
   data availability and the possibility of comparing the results with
   previous works. The results obtained provide a clearer picture of the
   success or failure of environmental and social policies. namely by
   avoiding the tampering effect resulting from the cumulative accounting
   of environmental externalities. This work also emphasizes the inadequacy
   of GDP as a welfare indicator, as well as the need to develop and adopt
   alternative indicators. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Questions: What are important forest characteristics determining
   colonization of forest patches by forest understorey species?
   Location: Planted forests on land recently reclaimed from the sea, the
   Netherlands.
   Methods: We related the distribution of forest specialist species in the
   understorey of 55 forests in Dutch IJsselmeer polders to the following
   forest characteristics: age, area, connectivity, distance to mainland
   (as a proxy for distance to seed source) and path density. We used
   species of the Fraxino-Ulmetum association for the Netherlands as
   reference for species that could potentially occur in the study area.
   Results: Area and age of the surveyed forests explained a large part of
   the variation in overall species composition and species number of
   forest plant species. The importance of connectivity and distance to the
   mainland of forest habitats became apparent only at a more detailed
   level of dispersal groups and individual species. The importance of
   forest parameters differed between dispersal groups and also between
   individual species. After 60 years, 75\% of the potential pool of
   wind-dispersed species has reached the polders, whereas this was only
   50\% for species lacking specific adaptations to long-distance
   dispersal. However, the average percentage of successful colonizing
   species present per forest was substantially lower, ranging from 15 to
   37\%.
   Conclusions: The data strongly suggest that the colonization process in
   polder forests is still in its initial phase, during which easily
   dispersed species dominate the vegetation. Colonization success of
   common species that lack adaptations to long-distance dispersal is
   affected by spatial configuration of the forests, and most rare species
   that could potentially occur in these forests are still absent.
   Implications for conservation of rare species in fragmented landscapes
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Are canopy gap dynamics responsible for driving the structural
   and compositional changes that have occurred over a 26-year period in a
   mature Quercus forest remnant?
   Location: Dobbs Natural Area, an unlogged 3.6-ha forest preserve in
   west-central Indiana, USA.
   Methods: We analyzed mapped permanent plot data for a site that
   illustrates a trend common in Quercus-dominated forests in eastern North
   America, where recruitment of new stems is dominated by mesophytic,
   shade-tolerant species such as Acer saccharum, rather than Quercus. We
   developed a GIS database from stand census measurements taken in 1974
   and 2000, employing it to conduct tree-by-tree comparisons that allow
   direct determination of ingrowth, mortality and survivorship, and to
   relate the spatial patterns of subcanopy dynamics to canopy gap
   occurrence.
   Results: The re-census shows modest changes in canopy composition, but
   much greater turnover in the subcanopy. Nearly half of all individuals
   originally present died; much of this mortality resulted from a major
   decline in subcanopy Ulmus americana. While overall density remained
   fairly constant, the subcanopy experienced substantial ingrowth of
   shade-tolerant Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, and Tilia americana.
   Canopy gaps, although forming at rates in the upper range of regional
   averages, did not significantly benefit subcanopy populations of Quercus
   spp. or most other taxa with limited shade tolerance.
   Conclusions: Canopy gaps play a minor role in driving the recent
   demographic trends of this stand. The spatial and temporal scales of
   light availability in gaps do not support regeneration of most
   shade-intolerant species. Compositional change parallels a historical
   shift in light regimes.}},

Title = {{The assessment of shear stress and bed stability in stream ecology}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{261-281}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Substratum stability and shear stress exerted by flowing water can
   have a strong influence on the structure of benthic communities. Bed
   stability can be characterised in a variety of ways, e.g. flow
   competence, threshold of particle entrainment, measures of erosion and
   deposition, particle transport distance, abrasion and bedload transport
   rate. This paper reviews methods for the quantification of bed stability
   and shear stress in streams and rivers that are relevant for the
   examination of the relationships between stream biota and bed stability.
   2. The most suitable method for a research project depends mainly on the
   objectives. The targeted group of biota, spatial and temporal scale of
   investigation, as well as hydraulic conditions and substratum
   characteristics at the study site(s) determine the choice of a technique
   for the assessment of bed stability.
   3. Indirect measurement of shear stress can be more accurate than
   calculations based on the DuBoys equation. However, the latter is
   preferred for reach-wide applications within the limits imposed by
   hydraulic conditions. The entrainment of the substratum is most
   effectively assessed using a combination of shear stress and competence
   equations, but the latter require careful parameterisation. At the
   patch-scale, direct measurement of entrainment force is a valid
   alternative.
   4. Morphometric budgeting is the most comprehensive and least invasive
   technique for the assessment of rates of erosion and deposition. The
   transport of substratum particles is efficiently monitored with in situ
   marked or active tracer particles which allow for rapid and non-invasive
   identification and high recovery rate. As the assessment of bedload
   transport rate by formulae can be inaccurate, direct measurement is
   preferred. However, bedload traps interfere with the substratum and
   continuity of measurement with samplers is limited. Thus developments in
   the sector of acoustic and piezoelectric devices offer a potential
   alternative.
   5. The abrasive forces by suspended sediments on stream biota are
   effectively evaluated with artificial blocks that are fixed on the
   stream bed. Descriptive surveys that assess bed stability offer an
   alternative to direct measurement and calculations. They are
   straightforward and non-invasive but can be observer-biased. If single
   methods do not provide useful links with biological data this may be
   improved by the application of a multivariate approach.
   6. Many of the methods assessed have not yet been applied in research on
   benthic communities, but these hydraulic and geomorphologic techniques
   offer considerable potential for the assessment of bed stability in
   stream ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation albedo is a critical component of the Earth's climate system,
   yet efforts to evaluate and improve albedo parameterizations in climate
   models have lagged relative to other aspects of model development. Here,
   we calculated growing season albedos for deciduous and evergreen
   forests, crops, and grasslands based on over 40 site-years of data from
   the AmeriFlux network and compared them with estimates presently used in
   the land surface formulations of a variety of climate models. Generally,
   the albedo estimates used in land surface models agreed well with this
   data compilation. However, a variety of models using fixed seasonal
   estimates of albedo overestimated the growing season albedo of northerly
   evergreen trees. In contrast, climate models that rely on a common
   two-stream albedo submodel provided accurate predictions of boreal
   needle-leaf evergreen albedo but overestimated grassland albedos.
   Inverse analysis showed that parameters of the two-stream model were
   highly correlated. Consistent with recent observations based on remotely
   sensed albedo, the AmeriFlux dataset demonstrated a tight linear
   relationship between canopy albedo and foliage nitrogen concentration
   (for forest vegetation: albedo=0.01+0.071\%N, r2=0.91; forests,
   grassland, and maize: albedo=0.02+0.067\%N, r2=0.80). However, this
   relationship saturated at the higher nitrogen concentrations displayed
   by soybean foliage. We developed similar relationships between a foliar
   parameter used in the two-stream albedo model and foliage nitrogen
   concentration. These nitrogen-based relationships can serve as the basis
   for a new approach to land surface albedo modeling that simplifies
   albedo estimation while providing a link to other important ecosystem

Abstract = {{1. For most ecologists, detection probability (p) is a nuisance variable
   that must be modelled to estimate the state variable of interest (i.e.
   survival, abundance, or occupancy). However, in the realm of invasive
   species control, the rate of detection and removal is the rate-limiting
   step for management of this pervasive environmental problem.
   2. For strategic planning of an eradication (removal of every
   individual), one must identify the least likely individual to be
   removed, and determine the probability of removing it.
   3. To evaluate visual searching as a control tool for populations of the
   invasive brown treesnake Boiga irregularis, we designed a mark-recapture
   study to evaluate detection probability as a function of time, gender,
   size, body condition, recent detection history, residency status,
   searcher team and environmental covariates.
   4. We evaluated these factors using 654 captures resulting from visual
   detections of 117 snakes residing in a 5-ha semi-forested enclosure on
   Guam, fenced to prevent immigration and emigration of snakes but not
   their prey. Visual detection probability was low overall ((p) over cap =
   0 07 per occasion) but reached 0.18 under optimal circumstances.
   5. Our results supported sex-specific differences in detectability that
   were a quadratic function of size, with both small and large females
   having lower detection probabilities than males of those sizes. There
   was strong evidence for individual periodic changes in detectability of
   a few days duration, roughly doubling detection probability (comparing
   peak to non-elevated detections). Snakes in poor body condition had
   estimated mean detection probabilities greater than snakes with high
   body condition. Search teams with high average detection rates exhibited
   detection probabilities about twice that of search teams with low
   average detection rates. Surveys conducted with bright moonlight and
   strong wind gusts exhibited moderately decreased probabilities of
   detecting snakes.
   6.Synthesis and applications. By emphasizing and modelling detection
   probabilities, we now know: (i) that eradication of this species by
   searching is possible, (ii) how much searching effort would be required,
   (iii) under what environmental conditions searching would be most
   efficient, and (iv) several factors that are likely to modulate this
   quantification when searching is applied to new areas. The same approach
   can be use for evaluation of any control technology or population
   monitoring programme.}},

Title = {{Lag-phases in alien plant invasions: separating the facts from the
   artefacts}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{370-378}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Temporal trends in biological invasions are often described by a
   lag-phase of little or no increase in species occurrence followed by an
   increase-phase in which species occurrence rises rapidly. While several
   biological and environmental mechanisms may underlie lag-phases, they
   may also represent statistical artefacts or temporal changes in sampling
   effort. To date, distinguishing the facts from these artefacts has not
   been possible. Here we describe a method for estimating the lag-phase in
   Cumulative records of species occurrence, using a piecewise regression
   model that explicitly differentiates the lag and increase phases. We
   used the von Bertalanffy, logistic, linear and exponential functions to
   model the increase phase, and identified the best-fitting function using
   model selection techniques. We confirmed the accuracy of our method
   using simulated data and then estimated the length of the lag-phase
   (t(lag)), the maximum collection rate (r) and the projected asymptotic
   number of records (K) using herbarium records for 105 weed species in
   New Zealand, while accounting for changes in sampling effort. Nearly all
   the New Zealand weed species had a lag-phase, which averaged around
   20-30 years, with 4\% of species having a lag-phase greater than 40
   years. In more than two thirds of the cases, the accumulation of records
   was best modelled with the decelerating von Bertalanffy function,
   despite the tendency for temporal variation in sampling effort to force
   cumulative herbarium records to follow the sigmoidal shape of a logistic
   curve. A positive correlation between r and K is consistent with the
   assumption that the Final distribution of an alien plant species
   reflects its rate of spread. Seemingly rare but fast-spreading aliens
   may thus become tomorrow's noxious weeds. A positive correlation between
   inflection year and r warns that the weeds that have only begun to
   spread relatively recently may spread faster than previously known
   invaders.}},

   AMAZONIAN: EVALUATION OF SOIL QUALITY INDICATORS}},
Booktitle = {{AMAZON BASIN: PLANT LIFE, WILDLIFE AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Series = {{Environmental Research Advances}},
Year = {{2010}},
Pages = {{1-40}},
Abstract = {{Puerto Ayacucho (PA), the capital of Amazonas State in Venezuela, has
   experienced a rapid population growth during the last decades due to the
   migration of indigenous communities living in the tropical rain forest
   who have settled in the nearby savanna, along the main highway. This
   poses the question of how to feed the growing population given the
   existing restrictions of low-fertility soils, risk of erosion,
   decreasing biodiversity and changes of consumption habits of the
   indigenous population due to transculturation. A variety of agrosystems
   (AS) ranging from the traditional conuco used by the indigenous
   communities to the agroforestry being practiced in the savanna by
   criollos have been identified in the forest-savanna ecotone surrounding
   PA. Those AS were evaluated by using criteria of sustainability; the
   main emphasis pointed to ecological and economical parameters.
   The Traditional Conuco (TC) could be considered economically and
   ecologically sustainable as long as there is no population growth and
   there is enough forest land to open a new ``conuco{''} and allow the old
   one to rest for a period longer than twenty years. Since there is not
   enough forest land available in nearby PA, the TC is unsustainable in
   this area.
   The conuco for Surplus (CS) and the Improved Conuco (IC) are not only
   unable to feed a growing population, but also contribute further than
   the TC to deforestation and associated erosion as it is occurring in the
   adjacent forests of PA. Nonetheless, the worst situation in terms of
   economical and ecological unsustainability is the case of the Conuco in
   Fallow (CF).
   In contrast to the conucos, there is a successful adaptation of
   agroforestry systems (AFS) in sandy savanna ultisols and entisols by
   amelioration of both soil structure and fertility when animal manure is
   used. Nonetheless, the extensive implementation of organic agroforestal
   systems in the area is, at the present time, limited due to the high
   price of animal food. Therefore, government policies addressed to
   achieve sustainable agriculture should consider the possibility of
   stimulating the AFS after identifying the best condition under which the
   indigenous as well as the criollo could adopt alternative AS such AFS
   without cultural or social costs.
   For the different conucos analyzed, although significant changes were
   found for several soil quality indicators, the changes obtained in many
   cases were not so evident, particularly in the case of the conucos in
   fallow; however, enzymatic activities (phosphatase and urease) were
   revealed as a very useful tool for analyzing changes after conuco
   establishment. On the other hand, the use of organic waste as
   alternative soil fertility amendments in nutrient sandy depleted savanna
   soils of Venezuelan Amazonia have resulted in increased organic matter
   and biological and enzymatic activities in soils which, in turn, may be
   related to crop productivity.}},

Title = {{The Misuse of BLUP in Ecology and Evolution}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{175}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{116-125}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) is a method for obtaining point
   estimates of a random effect in a mixed effect model. Over the past
   decade it has been used extensively in ecology and evolutionary biology
   to predict individual breeding values and reaction norms. These
   predictions have been used to infer natural selection, evolutionary
   change, spatial-genetic patterns, individual reaction norms, and
   frailties. In this article we show analytically and through simulation
   and example why BLUP often gives anticonservative and biased estimates
   of evolutionary and ecological parameters. Although some concerns with
   BLUP methodology have been voiced before, the scale and breadth of the
   problems have probably not been widely appreciated. Bias arises because
   BLUPs are often used to estimate effects that are not explicitly
   accounted for in the model used to make the predictions. In these cases,
   predicted breeding values will often say more about phenotypic patterns
   than the genetic patterns of interest. An additional problem is that
   BLUPs are point estimates of quantities that are usually known with
   little certainty. Failure to account for this uncertainty in subsequent
   tests can lead to both bias and extreme anticonservatism. We demonstrate
   that restricted maximum likelihood and Bayesian solutions exist for
   these problems and show how unbiased and powerful tests can be derived
   that adequately quantify uncertainty. Of particular utility is a new
   test for detecting evolutionary change that not only accounts for
   prediction error in breeding values but also accounts for drift. To
   illustrate the problem, we apply these tests to long-term data on the
   Soay sheep (Ovis aries) and the great tit (Parus major) and show that
   previously reported temporal trends in breeding values are not
   supported.}},

Abstract = {{New tools, such as intensive measurements, together with advanced

   Pyhajarvi, a large (155 km(2)) lake in southwest Finland. Pyhajarvi is

   use. The ecological state of Pyhajarvi has been closely monitored for
   decades, particularly since eutrophication became a major concern in the
   late 1980s. Two relatively new research methods were used to assess the
   spatial water quality of Pyhajarvi: (i) transect measurements from a
   moving boat; and (ii) remote sensing data based estimates. First, a
   flow-through method from a moving boat was successfully used to collect
   high resolution transect water quality data from the lake over six field
   campaigns. The method is relatively accurate but costly, and its use is
   mostly limited to special campaigns and intensive research, but not for
   long-term monitoring. Second, remote sensing methods were used to
   retrieve water quality information which was found consistent with the
   surface measurements from the boat. The estimation of parameters such as
   turbidity and humic substance concentration is possible with simple
   algorithms when using remote sensing (MERIS) data. The quantitative
   estimation of water quality by the methods used here requires concurrent

   further developed utilizing frequent on-line water quality and weather

Abstract = {{Populations can respond to environmental change over tens or hundreds of
   generations by shifts in phenotype that can be the result of a sustained
   physiological response, evolutionary (genetic) change, shifts in
   community composition, or some combination of these factors. Microbes
   evolve on human timescales, and evolution may contribute to marine
   phytoplankton responses to global change over the coming decades.
   However, it is still unknown whether evolutionary responses are likely
   to contribute significantly to phenotypic change in marine microbial
   communities under high pCO(2) regimes or other aspects of global change.
   Recent work by Muller et al. (2010) highlights that long-term responses
   of marine microbes to global change must be empirically measured and the
   underlying cause of changes in phenotype explained. Here, I briefly
   discuss how tools from experimental microbial evolution may be used to
   detect and measure evolutionary responses in marine phytoplankton grown
   in high CO2 environments and other environments of interest. I outline
   why the particular biology of marine microbes makes conventional
   experimental evolution challenging right now and make a case that marine
   microbes are good candidates for the development of new model systems in
   experimental evolution. I suggest that `black box' frameworks that focus
   on partitioning phenotypic change, such as the Price equation, may be
   useful in cases where direct measurements of evolutionary responses
   alone are difficult, and that such approaches could be used to test
   hypotheses about the underlying causes of phenotypic shifts in marine

Abstract = {{Comprehensive and standardized biodiversity monitoring schemes are
   needed to build scientifically sound decision-making tools for
   biodiversity conservation. Based on a thorough review of published
   literature, we propose a novel biodiversity monitoring framework to
   unify conservation theory and practice. The framework is built on the
   inter-connection among different types of indicators, and on the
   systematic articulation of their relationships into seven indicator
   approaches. Semi-natural grasslands and shrublands in Europe, which
   still lack a common biodiversity monitoring scheme, are used as a model
   for the framework. Different biotic indicators have been widely used to
   estimate the state of biodiversity, but we integrate these with
   biodiversity drivers, i.e. factors driving changes in biodiversity, to
   track biodiversity response to environmental changes. Precise
   information on biodiversity drivers (e.g. past and present management or
   disturbance regimes, environmental conditions, landscape patterns) has
   an effective indicator value, but this is often not taken into account
   in monitoring schemes. Our framework can be used to detect gaps in
   available data, translate indicator systems into practical conservation,
   identify combined sets of indicators to monitor biodiversity in target
   habitats, and recognize most suitable surrogates when information for
   some indicators is missing. We also take into account the effect of
   regional species pools in order to consider large-scale historical and
   biogeographical processes. We propose general guidelines to create
   validate and launch biodiversity monitoring frameworks for target
   habitats in the light of current examples of biodiversity conservation
   schemes (e.g. Natura 2000 in Europe). (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier

Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{While research continues on the causes, consequences, and rates of
   deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics, there is little
   agreement about what exactly is being lost, what we want back, and to
   whom the `we' refers. Particularly unsettling is that many analyses and
   well-intended actions are implemented in fogs of ambiguity surrounding
   definitions of the term `forest'-a problem that is not solely semantic;
   with development of markets for biomass carbon, vegetation
   classification exercises take on new relevance. For example, according
   to the basic implementation guidelines of the Kyoto Protocol, closed
   canopy natural forest could be replaced by monoclonal plantations of
   genetically engineered exotic tree species and no deforestation would
   have occurred. Following these same guidelines, carbon credits for
   afforestation could be available for planting trees in species-rich
   savannas; these new plantations would count towards a country moving
   towards the `forest transition,' the point at which there is no net
   `forest' loss. Such obvious conflicts between biodiversity conservation
   and carbon sequestration might be avoided if `forest' was clearly
   defined and if other vegetation types and other ecosystem values were
   explicitly recognized. While acknowledging that no one approach to
   vegetation classification is likely to satisfy all users at all scales,
   we present an approach that recognizes the importance of species
   composition, reflects the utility of land-cover characteristics that are
   identifiable via remote sensing, and acknowledges that many sorts of
   forest degradation do not reduce carbon stocks (e. g., defaunation) or
   canopy cover (e. g., over-harvesting of understory nontimber forest
   products).}},

Abstract = {{Policy makers often find their leeway restricted when it comes to
   shaping sustainable urban planning practice. Within each professional
   sector, there are limited opportunities for creative exploration in the
   cross-fire between minimum state regulations and relentless pressure
   from private developers. In face of the environmental challenges society
   is up against, a more extensive focus on the potential repertoire of
   design methods, solutions and experiences is needed.
   Broset is a 35 hectare site located 4 kilometers outside the center of
   Trondheim. Despite this moderate distance to the center, the area's
   character is of suburban nature. Broset has been chosen as a location
   for a new neighborhood that combines low energy demand with a socially
   sustainable living environment {[}1]. Sustainability is defined in a
   holistic way, including low energy demand and healthy materials, as well
   as social and economic issues. According to existing regulations
   approximately 1050-1750 housing can be constructed at Broset. Designing
   a settlement that enables people to lower their carbon-footprint is not
   only a matter of technology, material and energy use, but also includes
   lifestyle, housing patterns, and transport.
   The development of the Broset area also forms a major component of the
   participation of Trondheim city in the Norwegian Cities of the Future
   project, a strategic government-run program with focus on land use and
   transportation, energy use in buildings, consumption and waste, and
   climate change {[}2].
   This paper describes experiences from the capacity building activities

Abstract = {{At the interfaces of our mostly stationary architecture and surrounding
   nature we need to make constructions adaptable to ambient changes.
   Adaptability as a structural response to changing climate conditions,
   such as the intensity and direction of sun radiation, can be realised
   with deployable systems. These systems are often based on the
   combination of stiff compression members and soft tension members
   connected with hinges and rollers. Deployable systems in nature are
   often based on flexibility. This can be observed especially in plant
   movements. New construction materials such as fibre-reinforced polymers
   (FRP) can combine high tensile strength with low bending stiffness,
   allowing large elastic deformations. This may enable a completely new
   interpretation of convertible structures which work on reversible
   deformation, here referred to as elastic or pliable structures. In a
   current research project the kinematics for such systems are derived
   from certain applicable plant movements.
   This paper will focus on the biomimetic workflow used to develop elastic
   kinetic structures based on such movements. The abstraction and
   optimisation methods will be described from an engineering point of
   view, focusing on the technical approaches of converting the conceptual
   results of a first level abstraction into higher level abstractions and
   finally to physical design.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To project the distribution of three major forest types in the
   northeastern USA in response to expected climate change.
   Location The New England region of the United States.
   Methods We modelled the potential distribution of boreal conifer,
   northern deciduous hardwood and mixed oak-hickory forests using the
   process-based BIOME4 vegetation model parameterized for regional forests
   under historic and projected future climate conditions. Projections of
   future climate were derived from three general circulation models forced
   by three global warming scenarios that span the range of likely
   anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
   Results Annual temperature in New England is projected to increase by
   2.2-3.3 degrees C by 2041-70 and by 3.0-5.2 degrees C by 2071-99 with
   corresponding increases in precipitation of 4.7-9.5\% and 6.4-11.4\%,
   respectively. We project that regional warming will result in the loss
   of 71-100\% of boreal conifer forest in New England by the late 21st
   century. The range of mixed oak-hickory forests will shift northward by
   1.0-2.1 latitudinal degrees (c. 100-200 km) and will increase in area by
   149-431\% by the end of the 21st century. Northern deciduous hardwoods
   are expected to decrease in area by 26\% and move upslope by 76 m on
   average. The upslope movement of the northern deciduous hardwoods and
   the increase in oak-hickory forests coincide with an approximate 556 m
   upslope retreat of the boreal conifer forest by 2071-99. In our
   simulations, rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations reduce the losses of
   boreal conifer forest in New England from expected losses based on
   climatic change alone.
   Main conclusion Projected climate warming in the 21st century is likely
   to cause the extensive loss of boreal conifer forests, reduce the extent
   of northern hardwood deciduous forests, and result in large increases of
   mixed oak-hickory forest in New England.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{170-186}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aim The aim of this study was to determine the number of successful
   establishments of the invasive Argentine ant outside native range and to
   see whether introduced supercolonies have resulted from single or
   multiple introductions. We also compared the genetic diversity of native
   versus introduced supercolonies to assess the size of the propagules
   (i.e. the number of founding individuals) at the origin of the
   introduced supercolonies.
   Location Global.
   Methods We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers and microsatellite
   loci to study 39 supercolonies of the Argentine ant Linepithema humile
   covering both the native (n = 25) and introduced range (n = 14).
   Results Data from three mitochondrial genes and 13 nuclear
   microsatellites suggest that the introduced supercolonies studied
   originated from at least seven founding events out of the native area in
   Argentina (primary introductions). The distribution of mtDNA haplotypes
   also suggests that supercolonies in the introduced range each derive
   from a single source supercolony and that one of these source
   supercolonies has been particularly successful, being the basis of many
   introduced populations spread across the world. Comparison of the
   genetic diversity of supercolonies based on the five most diverse loci
   also revealed that native and introduced supercolonies have greatly
   overlapping ranges of diversity, although the genetic diversity is on
   average less in introduced than in native supercolonies.
   Main conclusions Both primary introductions (from the native range) and
   secondary introductions (from sites with established invasive
   supercolonies) were important in the global expansion of the Argentine
   ant. In combination with the similar social organization of colonies in
   the native and introduced range, this indicates that invasiveness did
   not evolve recently as a unique and historically contingent event (e.g.
   reduction of genetic diversity) in this species. Rather, native L.
   humile supercolonies have characteristics that make them pre-adapted to
   invade new - and in particular disturbed - habitats when given the
   opportunity. These results have important implications with regard to
   possible strategies to be used to control invasive ants.}},

Title = {{Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration in Russian and Swedish Model Forest
   Initiatives: Adaptive Governance Toward Sustainable Forest Management?}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Building the adaptive capacity of interlinked social and ecological
   systems is assumed to improve implementation of sustainable forest
   management (SFM) policies. One mechanism is collaborative learning by
   continuous evaluation, communication, and transdisciplinary knowledge
   production. The Model Forest (MF) concept, developed in Canada, is
   intended to encourage all dimensions of sustainable development through
   collaboration among stakeholders of forest resources in a geographical
   area. Because the MF approach encompasses both social and ecological
   systems, it can be seen as a process aimed at improving adaptive
   capacity to deal with uncertainty and change. We analyzed
   multi-stakeholder approaches used in four MF initiatives representing
   social-ecological systems with different governance legacies and
   economic histories in the northwest of the Russian Federation (Komi MF
   and Pskov MF) and in Sweden (Vilhelmina MF and the Foundation Safsen
   Forests in the Bergslagen region). To describe the motivations behind
   development of the initiative and the governance systems, we used
   qualitative open-ended interviews and analyzed reports and official
   documents. The initial driving forces for establishing new local
   governance arrangements were different in all four cases. All MFs were
   characterized by multilevel and multi-sector collaboration. However, the
   distribution of power among stakeholders ranged from clearly top down in
   the Russian Federation to largely bottom up in Sweden. All MF
   initiatives shared three main challenges: (a) to develop governance
   arrangements that include representative actors and stakeholders, (b) to
   combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to governance, and (c) to
   coordinate different sectors' modes of landscape governance. We conclude
   that, in principle, the MF concept is a promising approach to
   multi-stakeholder collaboration. However, to understand the local and
   regional dimensions of sustainability, and the level of adaptability of
   such multi-stakeholder collaboration initiatives, empirical studies of
   outcomes are needed. To assess the adaptive capacity, the states and
   trends of economic, ecological, social, and cultural dimensions in
   actual landscapes need to be linked to how the multistakeholder
   collaboration develops and performs over the long term.}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The role played by policy entrepreneurs in preparing, initiating, and
   implementing water policy change in Spain over the last two decades is
   examined in an effort to understand how transitions in water management
   occur. The main questions considered are whether policy entrepreneurs
   can influence water policy change, and which strategies they actually
   adopt to promote change. John Kingdon's multiple streams framework was
   used to assess the ways in which policy entrepreneurs succeed in
   challenging the dominant agenda, mobilizing alternative policy ideas,
   and making use of multiple venues for initiating policy change. The data
   set comprises secondary documentation and interviews with state and
   non-state actors involved in Spanish water management. The main findings
   are that policy entrepreneurs from certain social, scientific, and
   political organizations have indeed played a central role in fracturing
   the traditional and long-standing approach and decision making process
   to water management as well as in opening new avenues for policy change.
   The main implication is that accounts of water management transitions
   should place greater emphasis on the role of agency in bringing about

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{This paper makes both a theoretical and empirical contribution to a
   better understanding of how specific forms of network governance play a
   crucial role in enhancing sustainable development in rural areas.
   Drawing on the literature on social capital and social networks, I argue
   that a region has to achieve a certain level of cohesion in the network
   structure among actors from different societal sectors and governmental
   levels to strengthen rural sustainable development. However, to sustain
   positive regional development in the longer term, network structures
   also need to guarantee fragmentation and flexibility by including actors
   with varying views and interests. Empirically, the paper looks at the
   new policy of regional nature parks in Switzerland. The policy provides
   a good test case for the theoretical argument, because it aims at taking
   a cooperative and network-oriented approach to enhance rural sustainable
   development. Two case studies demonstrate that regional park projects
   have in fact strengthened the vertical cohesion between government
   levels. Remaining fragmentation at the local level could be a hindering
   factor while further establishing a park project in the region. In the
   longer term, however, it could guarantee the necessary flexibility to
   adapt to new ecological and socioeconomic developments that cannot be
   directly influenced by a region itself.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{People living in landscapes of high conservation value are trapped
   between their dependence on natural resources to meet their development
   aspirations and the international pressure to conserve those resources.
   Although it is increasingly recognized that the conservation of some
   natural resources cannot happen without providing alternative livelihood
   solutions for local communities dependent on them, global experiences
   illustrate that the successful integration of conservation and
   development continues to be elusive. We adapted the approach based on
   ``participatory vulnerability assessments{''} developed for climate
   change research and applied it to changes occurring in a conservation
   and development context. As a case study, we focused on a biodiversity
   hotspot in Southwest Cameroon that was recently designated a national
   park. We have shown that local communities believe their livelihood
   options will be reduced by the creation of the national park.
   Compensation measures such as ongoing community development plans are
   not yet impacting local livelihoods. Their success will only be
   measurable in the long term, whereas the restriction in access to the
   national park is already in effect. Meanwhile, new roads, and attractive
   prices for cash crops including cocoa, have created the opportunity for
   alternative sources of income that could have substantial impacts on
   smallholders as well as for conservation. The aim of this work was to
   identify risks and opportunities associated with conservation and
   development as a first step in improving decision making. Project
   activities are not implemented in isolation from the global context and
   are therefore not the only drivers of adaptation for local communities.
   One of our main findings is that new external stimuli, such as markets,
   may be highly influential, potentially undermining conservation and
   development efforts if not addressed in a properly designed adaptive
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Since the adoption of dramatic national water policy reforms in 1992,
   Mexico's water governance paradigm has had time to mature. This article
   analyzes Mexico's experience with water policy transition, based on
   research in irrigation districts and river basin councils in the
   northwestern state of Sonora. I examine the trajectory of the water
   policy transition using the policy sciences framework set forth in the
   introductory article. The article argues that the transition to a ``new
   culture of water{''} focused on the three principles of efficiency,
   decentralization, and sustainability has only minimally fulfilled its
   goal of establishing a new state- citizen relationship around water
   policy. Multiple and conflicting agendas are represented in the water
   policy, and a coherent governance strategy that is sustained over time
   and place has not been achieved. In particular, legal modifications to
   the national water law that emphasize integrated watershed planning and
   local participation were approved in 2004 but have never been formally
   implemented. Political fragmentation and changing of parties in power
   has contributed to the challenge of working towards a more democratic,

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{310-319}},
Abstract = {{Differences are emerging in decentralization of forest and community
   management in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa. This paper draws on
   case studies in each country to examine five aspects of their
   decentralization experience, namely forest tenure, new organizational
   structures, accountability and livelihood outcomes. Tenure arrangements
   developed as a result of decentralization are important for communities,
   as these determine the nature of access sanctioned by the state and
   security of the arrangements. The transfer of power to new organizations
   is proving to be a challenge. Experiences across the three case studies
   show that new committees were formed for these forestry initiatives by
   outside agencies and attempts were made to make them relevant to the way
   local communities managed forests. One of the main tenets of
   decentralization revolves around accountability of community
   representatives to their constituents rather than to the state. Although
   moves have been made to promote the accountability of community
   representatives, these have produced mixed results in Zimbabwe,
   Mozambique and South Africa. Only after changes in the approach taken by
   the state in Zimbabwe did community representatives become more
   accountable. In Mozambique, because of the special arrangements around
   the specific case, greater authority was given to community
   representatives, whereas, in South Africa, the state retained authority
   over representatives. Decentralization may bring benefits and improve
   communities' livelihoods from forestry activities, however much more
   still needs to be done by states in order for forests to take
   communities out of poverty.}},

Abstract = {{The Tampa Bay region faces projected stress from climate change,

   that is valued (economically, aesthetically and culturally) in its

   development of open land, and other stresses, redressing past damage to
   Bay habitats and protecting them in the future will remain the greatest
   challenge for managers in this region. Maintaining water quality gains
   of recent decades and sustaining ecological services requires careful
   thought and planning to compensate for these stressors. Approaches
   piloted during this study will be applicable to many urbanized
   estuaries, particularly along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coastline, because
   they face similar stresses.
   Regional and local planners, managers, and decision-makers, like those
   in the Tampa region, require new or modified ways to address questions
   regarding the production, delivery, and consumption of ecosystem
   services under various projected future scenarios of climate change and
   urban development. Approaches that we are developing collaboratively
   must address human well-being endpoints (the focus of ecosystem
   services) as well as more traditional measures of ecosystem integrity,
   sustainability, and productivity. Predictive estimates of ecosystem
   services value require 1) Alternative future scenarios, especially
   population growth and effects from climate change 2) Models translating
   environmental conditions set by these scenarios into ecosystem services
   production and their sustainability at different scales from local
   neighborhoods to watershed and larger and 3) An approach to visualize
   and link model outputs to a common currency for prioritization and
   valuation. Collectively, these comprise tools that can be used to make
   well-informed, thoughtful, and publically transparent decisions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Natural biogeochemical processes and diverse communities of aquatic
   biota regulate freshwater quantity and quality in ways that are not
   sufficiently acknowledged nor appreciated by the water resources
   management community. The establishment and enforcement of environmental
   flow requirements offer promising means to improve and care for these
   critical environmental services. This Special Issue provides new
   insights and novel techniques to determine, protect and restore
   ecologically and socially sustainable flow regimes, and thereby help
   achieve the water-related goals of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.
   2. Whilst alteration of flow, sediment, organic matter and thermal
   regimes interact to reduce biological diversity and the ecological
   integrity of freshwater ecosystems - and thereby degrade the properties
   and ecological services most valued by humans - environmental flows'
   left in rivers, or restored to developed rivers, will sustain many
   ecological and societal values. The success of river protection and
   rehabilitation / restoration depends upon understanding and accurately
   modelling relationships between hydrological patterns, fluvial
   disturbance and ecological responses in rivers and flood-plains.
   3. This Special Issue presents new analytical and modelling approaches
   to support the development of hydro-ecological models and environmental
   flow standards at multiple spatial scales - applicable to all rivers in
   any economic and societal setting. Examples include the new framework
   Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration (ELOHA) founded on
   hydrological classification and gradient analysis; ecological trait
   analysis; Bayesian hierarchical modelling; Bayesian Decision Networks;
   and Integrated Basin Flow Assessment (IBFA).
   4. Advances in the allocation of flood flows along the River Murray in
   Australia, an Ecosystems Function Model (HEC-EFM) for the Bill Williams
   River restoration programme in Arizona ( U. S. A), the European Water
   Framework Directive, and improved management of hydroelectric dams
   demonstrate the potential for significant ecological recovery following
   partial restoration of natural river flow regimes. 5. Based on
   contributions to this Special Issue, the action agenda of the 2007
   Brisbane Declaration on environmental flows and the wider literature, we
   propose an invigorated global research programme to construct and
   calibrate hydro-ecological models and to quantify the ecological goods
   and services provided by rivers in contrasting hydro-climatic settings
   across the globe. A major challenge will be to find acceptable ways to
   manage rivers for multiple uses. Climate change intensifies the urgency.
   Environmental flows help to preserve the innate resilience of aquatic

Title = {{Can biological invertebrate traits resolve effects of multiple stressors
   on running water ecosystems?}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{80-119}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Accurately assessing the effects of multiple human-caused stressors
   on freshwater (and other) ecosystems is an essential step in the
   development of efficient decision support tools for environmental
   managers. Our objective is to review potentials and limitations of the
   use of biological traits as indicators (BTIs) of multiple stressor
   effects on running water (i.e. lotic) ecosystems.
   2. Pioneers in ecology provided mechanistic explanations for responses
   of alternative biological traits to a given stressor and for the action
   of habitat harshness as a trait filter. These ideas were subsequently
   integrated in theoretical ecological constructs (e.g. Habitat Templet
   Concept) that form the basis of the BTI approach.
   3. To resolve the effects of multiple stressors on running waters
   requires multiple traits of a biologically diverse group of organisms
   such as lotic invertebrates. To meet this goal, however, recently
   created databases on the biological traits of lotic invertebrates must
   be expanded and unified.
   4. Addressing the technical implementation of the BTI approach, we
   illustrate that anticipated problems with phylogenetic trait syndromes
   are seemingly less serious in reality and that presence-absence data of
   genera and few sample replicates are sufficient for accurate trait
   descriptions of invertebrate communities.
   5. Current trends in politics demand that biomonitoring tools be
   effective at large scales, i.e. large-scale trait patterns of natural
   communities (i.e. at reference conditions) should be relatively stable.
   The trait composition of natural invertebrate communities is relatively
   stable at the scale of Europe and North America because trait filters of
   natural lotic habitats act similarly across large biogeographical units.
   6. The mechanistic actions of stressors on the biological traits of
   invertebrates should facilitate a priori predictions, but the complexity
   of potential trait responses makes such predictions sometimes difficult.
   7. To illustrate potentials and limitations of BTIs to identify a given
   stressor acting exclusively (or primarily), we examine the (i) use of
   functional feeding groups to indicate the action of various stressors
   and (ii) trait responses to an indirectly acting stressor (discharge
   variation) and to a more directly acting stressor (near-bottom flow). If
   the excessive use of specific traits for the indication of too many
   different stressors is avoided and a given stressor acts directly on
   traits as a priori predicted, reliable interpretations of trait
   responses can be achieved.
   8. To illustrate how BTIs can identify individual stressors acting in
   combination, we examine three cases of multiple stressors: (i) heavy
   metal pollution in combination with cargo-ship traffic; (ii)
   eutrophication and fine sediment deposits associated with land use; and
   (iii) various stressors associated with climate change in combination
   with salinity. If the number of the assessed traits is sufficiently
   great and the action of each individual among the multiple stressors is
   not too weak, multiple traits can potentially resolve the effects of
   multiple stressors.
   9. Thematic implications: if the expansion and unification of existing
   trait databases can be achieved, the rapidly growing knowledge about
   biological trait responses of lotic invertebrates to individual and
   multiple stressors should enable the identification of management
   priorities focused on: (i) individually acting stressors (manage
   stressor A at site X prior to stressor B at site Y); (ii) multiple
   stressors acting in different combinations at different sites (manage
   stressors A \& B at site X prior to stressors C \& D at site Y); and
   (iii) individual stressors acting in combination (manage stressor A

Title = {{Rethinking the role of ecological research in the sustainable management

Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{1. Despite the dramatic growth in the understanding of freshwater
   ecosystems in recent decades, many analyses indicate that the magnitude,
   complexity and urgency of freshwater environmental problems are
   increasing rather than decreasing. This pattern serves as a sobering
   reminder that ecological science is necessary but not sufficient for
   addressing a wide range of sustainability challenges and suggests the
   need for alternative strategies that can increase the effectiveness of
   science in environmental problem solving.
   2. One key step in efforts to link knowledge with action more
   effectively is to use a conceptual model that examines factors leading
   to mismatches between the demand for science to achieve various societal
   goals and the supply of scientific information by researchers. Some
   common examples of supply and demand mismatches include instances where
   scientific information is provided but not needed, is needed but not
   provided, is not sufficiently trusted or reliable or conflicts with
   user's values or interests.
   3. Recent work in sustainability science and related fields suggests
   that such mismatches can be reduced by more careful attention to the
   design of interdisciplinary research programmes and stakeholder
   partnerships. For example, research should be salient to the concerns of
   stakeholders. Research also needs to be independent and objective, so
   that it is credible to stakeholders. Moreover, researchers should work
   with stakeholders in ways that foster legitimate decision-making
   processes. We show how such design criteria can help in identifying and
   overcoming potential obstacles which limit the influence of ecological
   research on decision making.
   4. These strategies are illustrated by a collaborative programme
   designed to promote the sustainable management of vernal pools in the
   northeastern U.S.A. These unique ecosystems are vulnerable to multiple
   stressors associated with urbanisation, forest management and climate
   change. An interdisciplinary team of researchers with a wide array of
   expertise (e.g., ecology, economics, communication, institutional
   governance, regional planning and forestry) has established a long-term
   partnership with multiple levels of government, the private sector,
   conservation organisations and citizens. Using a variety of approaches
   for linking knowledge with action, this programme has helped produce new
   land use regulations and management practices designed to balance
   economic development and vernal pool protection.
   5. Thematic implications: freshwater ecosystems are increasingly
   impaired by multiple stressors that are usually the product of complex
   interactions between socioeconomic and biophysical factors. Thus, an
   understanding of the biophysical causes and consequences of such
   impairment will rarely be sufficient for achieving sustainable
   management policies and practices. Rather, we need a more integrative
   and action-oriented approach that explicitly acknowledges the strong
   coupling between natural and human systems and focuses on reciprocal
   interactions between knowledge-generating and decision-making processes.
   We believe that the emerging field of sustainability science holds
   considerable promise for strengthening connections between knowledge and
   action.}},

Abstract = {{Water, that is often the main limiting factor of plant growth, is also
   the main factor directly or indirectly responsible for soil and land
   degradation processes. These processes affect the conservation of the
   increasingly scarce soil and water resources, because they are strongly
   linked to unfavorable changes in the hydrological behavior affecting
   soil water balance and soil moisture regime. They are related to soil
   and climate characteristics, but inappropriate land use and soil and
   water management are the main factors responsible of those processes.
   The previewed effects of global climate changes would mainly affect
   hydrological processes in the land surface mostly related to the soil
   water balance. Soil water management, both under dry-land and irrigated
   conditions, may affect more the soil hydrological processes than the
   previewed climate changes, or may increase the influence of those
   changes on soil degradation processes. In any case it is important to
   include the effects of climate change in the performance of current or
   planned water management systems. Weak knowledge of the hydrological
   processes involved, generally associated to the inadequacy of methods
   for assessing and monitoring such processes, including the use of
   pedo-transfer functions, has usually hampered the adoption of adequate
   integral soil and water management policies for prediction and
   prevention of soil and water degradation of soil and water resources in
   situ and related effects like surface and groundwater contamination,
   droughts, flooding, landslides, sedimentation, etc. To avoid these
   failures there would be required non empirical modeling approaches,
   mainly based on soil hydrological processes together with rainfall
   records, under different scenarios of changing climate, soil properties,
   topography, and land use and water management. Simulation models based
   on hydrological processes allow to integrate and to convert the measured
   or estimated soil, climate and management parameters into predicted soil
   water balances and soil moisture regimes for each particular
   combination, actual or previewed, of them. Those models must allow to
   incorporate potentially significant and highly uncertain information
   about potential climate change. Such approach has been applied to the
   evaluation of the effects on the soil water balance and soil moisture
   regime, associated to new land and crop management systems, and to the
   previewed climate changes, in dry-land and irrigated vineyards for
   quality wine production in NE Spain. The generated information has been
   used in planning strategies for land use, and in the selection of the
   soil and water management practices, based on probabilities of success,
   levels of risk and long term sustainability. Special attention is given
   to the water use efficiency, under the semiarid Mediterranean climate,
   with low and very variable and erratic rainfall, and with scarce
   availability of water for irrigation, in relation to the production,
   both in quantity and quality of grapevines and wine. The management
   strategies may be evaluated against different scenarios of changing
   climate conditions, taking decisions after assigning probabilities to
   each scenario and weighting the results.}},

Abstract = {{Diatoms are ideal bio-indicators of water ecosystem health and can be
   classified into one of the trophic state indexes (TSI) according to the
   nutrient level. Thus, the diatoms can be used to indicate the
   relationship between the organisms and the environmental parameters. In
   order to find the correct diatom-indicator connection, we can use a
   certain classification algorithm directly from measure data. This
   process of diatom classification can be significantly improved using
   information technology, especially data mining tools. In this direction,
   this paper work present several classification models with the novel
   method called aggregation trees based on evenly sigmoid shaped
   membership function (MF). Earlier, numerous statistical approaches have
   been used for this purpose, which provide very useful data inside
   information, but they are limited to interpretation. Further improvement
   is made by using decision trees, which increases interpretability, but
   remains not resistant to over fitting and robustness on data change. The
   proposed method in this paper synthesizes these advantages, in terms of
   interpretability, resistance of over-fitting and high classification
   accuracy compared with classical classification algorithms. This is
   confirmed by the experimental evaluation. Based on these evaluation
   results, one model for each TSI is presented and discussed. From
   ecological point of view, the described method improves the water
   quality and sustaining bio diversity understandings of this ecosystem.
   The method added new ecological knowledge about the ecological
   indicators for certain diatoms, which have been recently discovered. (C)

Volume = {{79}},

Abstract = {{1. Estimating variation in demographic rates, such as survival and
   fecundity, is important for testing life-history theory and identifying
   conservation and management goals.
   2. We used 16 years (1993-2008) of mark-recapture data to estimate
   age-specific survival and breeding probabilities of the little brown
   myotis Myotis lucifugus LeConte in southern New Hampshire, USA. Using
   Kendall \& Nichols' (1995) full-likelihood approach of the robust design
   to account for temporary emigration, we tested whether survival and
   breeding propensity is influenced by regional weather patterns and
   timing of reproduction.
   3. Our results demonstrate that adult female survival of M. lucifugus
   ranged from 0.63 (95\% CL = 0.56, 0.68) to 0.90 (95\% CL = 0.77, 0.94),
   and was highest in wet years with high cumulative summer precipitation.
   First-year survival {[}range: 0.23 (95\% CL = 0.14, 0.35) to 0.46 (95\%
   CL = 0.34, 0.57)] was considerably lower than adult survival and
   depended on pup date of birth, such that young born earlier in the
   summer (c. late May) had a significantly higher probability of surviving
   their first year than young born later in the summer (c. mid-July).
   Similarly, the probability of young females returning to the maternity
   colony to breed in the summer following their birth year was higher for
   individuals born earlier in the summer {[}range: 0.23 (95\% CL = 0.08,
   0.50) to 0.53 (95\% CL = 0.30, 0.75)].
   4. The positive influence of early parturition on 1st-year survival and
   breeding propensity demonstrates significant fitness benefits to
   reproductive timing in this temperate insectivorous bat.
   5. Climatic factors can have important consequences for population
   dynamics of temperate bats, which may be negatively affected by summer
   drying patterns associated with global climate change.
   6. Understanding long-term demographic trends will be important in the
   face of a novel disease phenomenon (White-Nose Syndrome) that is
   associated with massive mortalities in hibernating bat species,
   including M. lucifugus, in the northeastern United States.}},

Booktitle = {{LONG-TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH: BETWEEN THEORY AND APPLICATION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Pages = {{179-187}},
Abstract = {{Long-term changes of freshwater ecosystems are mainly caused by
   immissions from drainage basin and atmosphere (nutrients, acid
   substances, etc.) and by changing climatic conditions. Freshwater
   ecosystems often react in non-linear ways to these external forces.
   Beyond a certain threshold, gradual shifts may cause catastrophic
   switches to another state. The way back to the previous state rarely
   corresponds to the past changes because of memory effects of the system.
   Long-term studies are necessary, but they do not allow for a simple
   extrapolation of past observations into the future.
   Freshwater systems are also influenced by rare events like invasion of
   new species, spates or droughts. Effects of perturbations should be
   studied until the system establishes a new equilibrium.
   The analysis of long-term processes needs sound knowledge about natural
   oscillations or gradual changes of the baseline. Monitoring programmes
   of German lakes and reservoirs rarely last longer than 30 years. They
   usually started after serious environmental problems had emerged; they
   do not cover periods without human impacts (baseline conditions).
   Therefore, long-term monitoring should be accompanied and extended by
   palaeolimnological approaches.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{413}},
Pages = {{267-276}},
Abstract = {{A major challenge to ecologists is identifying factors that make a
   system susceptible to regime shifts or state transitions. Theory and
   modelling have suggested a number of indicators to warn of approaching
   tipping points, but empirical tests of their validity are few. We tested
   2 indicators, change to a key species and increased temporal
   variability, in a harbour, a system type rarely studied for regime
   shifts and alternate states. Long-term monitoring over 20 yr on a number
   of intertidal sandflats allowed us to document change and determine
   potential contributing factors. We detected decreasing abundance in the
   key species and increased temporal variability ( flickering) of
   community composition before a trophic and functional change to an
   alternate community type. Detection of these indicators occurred despite
   cyclic patterns in community and population dynamics and a relatively
   fast and permanent change of one external condition ( nutrients). We
   provide evidence that this shift was the product of a relatively small
   change in management of sewage disposal, combined with climate dynamics
   and mediated through changes in a key species, a tubeworm that provides
   biogenic habitat structure, stabilises sediment and affects dispersal
   and recruitment. These factors all interacted to escalate the effect of
   the relatively small changes in nutrients across a tipping point.}},

Abstract = {{Study of the dynamics in marine fish larvae is notoriously difficult,

   determined from counting daily increments on otoliths of larvae. The
   hatchdate frequency distribution determined from sampling a population
   of larvae depends on factors influencing birth and death processes, i.e.
   spawning times and survival rates. Using a nonlinear and partly
   parametric statistical model, temperature, strong winds, and the age
   frequency of spawning adults were found to strongly influence
   hatchdates. Moreover, the interaction of both a climate regime shift and

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{401}},
Pages = {{269-277}},
Abstract = {{Niche variation is a widespread phenomenon that has important
   implications for ecological interactions and conservation biology, but
   few studies have quantified the trophic niche width (TNW) and its
   within- and between-individual components. We used stable isotopes of
   body feathers to investigate (1) seasonal isotopic niche changes of 4
   southern procellariiforms and, (2) the level to which individuals are
   specialised relative to their population within each season. (1) delta
   C-13 and delta N-15 values of chicks and adults indicated a well-defined
   trophic segregation within the seabird assemblage during both the
   breeding and poorly known moulting (inter-nesting) periods, and they
   underlined marked species-specific seasonal changes. One species
   (light-mantled sooty albatross) remained within the Southern Ocean both
   during breeding and body feather moult, while the 3 others migrated
   either to oceanic subtropical waters (wandering and sooty albatrosses)
   or high isotopic marine areas (e.g. productive neritic waters;
   white-chinned petrel) during the moulting period. (2) Isotopic variances
   and TNW were generally low, indicating that birds belong to isotopic
   specialist populations within a given period. Variances and TNW were
   larger for white-chinned petrel chicks and light-mantled sooty albatross
   adults, respectively, indicating isotopic generalist populations and
   revealing 2 new foraging behaviours. Individual white-chinned petrel
   chicks segregated by their feather isotopic signatures, thus indicating
   individual/pair specialisation of parent birds during the chick-rearing
   period. The light-mantled sooty albatross population included mostly
   isotopic generalist individuals during the moulting period, with
   individuals using different habitats and diets. The study highlights the
   utility of feather isotopic signature for determining TNW and points out
   the necessity to develop such new approaches to better depict niche
   variations at both population and individual levels.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is one of the greatest challenges to sustainable
   development. Results from many individual studies show significant
   variation in response to climate change and human activities. Given the
   scope and variability of these trends, global patterns may be much more
   important than individual studies in assessing, the effects of global
   change. There is a need to synthesize quantitatively, existing results
   on ecosystems and their responses to global change, in order to reach a
   general consensus or summarize the differences. Meta-analysis provides
   such a quantitative synthetic method, in that it statistically
   integrates results from individual studies to find common trends and
   differences: so called fingerprints of change. Only a small number of
   studies to date have performed a formal statistical meta-analysis of
   species' responses or have synthesized independent studies to reveal
   emergent and globally coherent patterns of ecological changes in
   physical and in biological systems in the phenology and distribution of
   plants and animals. There are very few reports available on the use of
   meta-analysis to examine global climate change in Australia. The
   unequivocal conclusion across the global syntheses, to date, is that
   twentieth-century anthropogenic global warming has already impacted on
   the Earth's biota. This chapter reviews the general methodology of

Title = {{THE ROLE OF LAKE SHORE SAND DEPOSITS AS BANK OF CILIATE, ROTIFER AND

Journal = {{POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{The experiment, with the use of sand deposit from hygroarenal (shore
   sand beach wetted by lake waves) of the beach of eutrophic Lake
   Mikolajskie (Masurian Lakeland, Poland), was performed in order to test
   the hypothesis that shore sand deposit is the bank of resting forms of
   ciliate, rotifer and crustacean species. The experiment was conducted
   over a 38 days period in March-April 2004. Frozen sand taken in winter
   was exposed in aquariums filled with pre-filtered (GF/C) lake water in
   stable temperature (20 degrees C), oxygen saturation and 12:12
   light/dark conditions. Samples (three replicates) were taken each day. A
   total number of 44 ciliate, 59 rotifer and 9 crustacean taxa were
   identified during the studied period. Resting forms of different species
   and/ or taxonomic groups developed in different time and it may be the
   result of different strategies in colonization of new habitats.
   Organisms forming resting cysts such as ciliates (11 species) and
   bdelloid rotifers appeared after the first day of the incubation whereas
   organisms hatching from resting eggs (monogonont rotifers and crustacea)
   were observed from the 2nd-3rd day of the experiment. The numbers of all
   the studied groups of organisms increased gradually and then strongly
   decreased indicating probably nutrient and/or organic matter limitation.
   The highest numbers of ciliates (731 ind, cm(-2) of sand) was found on
   the 5th day, rotifers (987 ind. 100 cm(-2)) on the 23(rd) day,
   cladocerans (60 ind. 100 cm(-2)) on the 21(st) day and copepods (30 ind.
   100 cm(-2)) on the 33(rd) day of the experiment. The results of this
   study suggests that shore sand deposits being the temporal refugium for
   the small-bodied invertebrates transported here with the wave action may
   also play an important role as the transfer for their further dispersal
   in addition to postulated ways of expansions such as wind, rain, animals
   and surface runoff.}},

Abstract = {{Although the study of adaptation is central to biology, two types of
   adaptation are recognized in the biological field: physiological
   adaptation (accommodation or acclimation; an individual organism's
   phenotype is adjusted to its environment) and evolutionary-biological
   adaptation (adaptation is shaped by natural selection acting on genetic
   variation). The history of the former concept dates to the late
   nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and has more recently been
   systemized in the twenty-first century. Approaches to the understanding
   of phenotypic plasticity and learning behavior have only recently been
   developed, based on cellular-histological and behavioral-neurobiological
   techniques as well as traditional molecular biology. New developments of
   the former concepts in phenotypic plasticity are discussed in bacterial
   persistence, wing di-/polymorphism with transgenerational effects,
   polyphenism in social insects, and defense traits for predator
   avoidance, including molecular biology analyses. We also discuss new
   studies on the concept of genetic accommodation resulting in evolution
   of phenotypic plasticity through a transgenerational change in the
   reaction norm based on a threshold model. Learning behavior can also be
   understood as physiological phenotypic plasticity, associating with the
   brain-nervous system, and it drives the accelerated evolutionary change
   in behavioral response (the Baldwin effect) with memory stock.
   Furthermore, choice behaviors are widely seen in decision-making of
   animal foragers. Incorporating flexible phenotypic plasticity and
   learning behavior into modeling can drastically change dynamical
   behavior of the system. Unification of biological sciences will be
   facilitated and integrated, such as behavioral ecology and behavioral
   neurobiology in the area of learning, and evolutionary ecology and
   molecular developmental biology in the theme of phenotypic plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe a new method of graphically presenting

   aims to provide people with an interest in rangelands (stakeholders)

   condition as time or T-marks along gradients or continuums. The ends of
   these continuums are reference points, which are values for indicators
   defining highly functional to very dysfunctional rangeland systems. The
   T-marks for an indicator along its continuum are also coded as to how
   changes relate to combinations of recent seasonal conditions and
   longer-term management effects. Codes are based on a two-way matrix
   combining `seasonal quality' (e. g. rainfall in a specified period
   relative to the long-term record) and expected responses from land
   management (i.e. increase, decrease or no change relative to that
   predicted from seasonal quality). Monitoring data available in the

   illustrate the use of coded T-mark continuums. We show succinctly how

Title = {{A review of sampling designs for the measurement of soil organic carbon
   in Australian grazing lands}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{227-246}},
Abstract = {{The accurate measurement of the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock in
   Australian grazing lands is important due to the major role that SOC
   plays in soil productivity and the potential influence of soil C cycling
   on Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. However, the current sampling
   methodologies for SOC stock are varied and potentially conflicting. It
   was the objective of this paper to review the nature of, and reasons
   for, SOCvariability; the sampling methodologies commonly used; and to
   identify knowledge gaps for SOC measurement in grazing lands. Soil C
   consists of a range of biological materials, in various SOC pools such
   as dissolved organic C, micro- and meso-fauna (microbial biomass),
   fungal hyphae and fresh plant residues in or on the soil (particulate
   organic C, light-fraction C), the products of decomposition (humus, slow
   pool C) and complexed organic C, and char and phytoliths (inert, passive
   or resistant C); and soil inorganic C (carbonates and bicarbonates).
   Microbial biomass and particulate or light-fraction organic C are most
   sensitive to management or land-use change; resistant organicCand soil
   carbonates are least sensitive. TheSOCpresent at any location is
   influenced by a series of complex interactions between plant growth,
   climate, soil type or parent material, topography and site management.
   Because of this, SOCstock andSOCpools are highly variable on both
   spatial and temporal scales. This creates a challenge for efficient
   sampling. Sampling methods are predominantly based on design-based
   (classical) statistical techniques, crucial to which is a randomised
   sampling pattern that negates bias. Alternatively a model-based
   (geostatistical) analysis can be used, which does not require
   randomisation. Each approach is equally valid to characterise SOC in the
   rangelands. However, given that SOC reporting in the rangelands will
   almost certainly rely on average values for some aggregated scale (such
   as a paddock or property), wecontend that the design-based approach
   might be preferred. Wealso challenge soil surveyors and their sponsors
   to realise that: (i) paired sites are the most efficient way of
   detecting a temporal change inSOCstock, but destructive sampling and
   cumulative measurement errors decrease our ability to detect change;
   (ii) due to (i), an efficient sampling scheme to estimate baseline
   status is not likely to be an efficient sampling scheme to estimate
   temporal change; (iii) samples should be collected as widely as possible
   within the area of interest; (iv) replicate of laboratory analyses is a
   critical step in being able to characterise temporal change. Sampling
   requirements for SOC stock in Australian grazing lands are yet to be
   explicitly quantified and an examination of a range of these ecosystems
   is required in order to assess the sampling densities and techniques
   necessary to detect specified changes in SOC stock and SOC pools. An
   examination of techniques that can help reduce sampling requirements
   (such as measurement of the SOC fractions that are most sensitive to
   management changes and/ or measurement at specific times of the
   year-preferably before rapid plant growth-to decrease temporal
   variability), and new technologies for in situ SOC measurement is also
   required.}},

Abstract = {{The states of Rondonia and Mato Grosso in Brazil together make up the
   world's largest agricultural frontier. Between 2001 and 2004,
   deforestation, to provide land for highly mechanized agriculture in this
   area, reached unprecedented rates. The environmental consequences of
   this include increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from above and
   below ground sources. In this area where agriculture is a relatively new
   activity, land use and management practices change rapidly as farmers
   react to market pressures but also use trial and error to increase
   productivity/reduce losses. Farmers routinely make use of the latest
   technologies making agricultural expansion very different from
   historical examples. The fact that systems are in a state of flux has
   implications for sustainability and the ability of scientists to produce
   local and national GHG inventories and project future GHG emissions and
   carbon stock changes. Such projections are necessary to assess the full
   environmental impacts of such large scale native vegetation loss and to
   inform policy makers accordingly.
   A pilot study of farmer interviews around the town of Sinop, Mato
   Grosso, found that land management methods have varied over time, with a
   recent trend emerging to move from monoculture systems to integrated
   crop/livestock systems. The interviews also revealed that management
   practices employed by the small (<500 ha) farms differed markedly from
   those employed by medium (>500 ha) and large (>10,000 ha) farms. Wider
   studies carried out in the neighbouring state of Rondonia have shown
   soil C stocks and GHG emissions to be highly dependent on agricultural
   management. We discuss the implications of rapidly changing management
   practices in the agricultural frontier region of Mato Grosso and
   Rondonia on past regional estimates of C stocks and GHG fluxes and
   future projections. The future outlook is discussed in the context of
   possibility of REDD being included in a successor to the Kyoto Protocol.}},

   experiment}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{604-611}},
Abstract = {{Context. Prey switching by invasive carnivorans to changing food supply
   could severely impact on endemic prey of conservation importance, but
   experimental evidence for prey switching in carnivorans is rare. Stoats
   (Mustela erminea) were introduced to New Zealand and now threaten
   survival of many native birds, reptiles and invertebrates.
   Aim. Our primary objective was to see whether abundant food caused
   stoats inhabiting an alpine grassland site to alter the rate at which
   they preyed upon weta (Orthoptera : Hemiandrus sp.), hares (Lepus
   europeus), birds and mice (Mus musculus).
   Methods. We used dead rabbits as supplemental food in a
   before-after-control-impact experiment. Stoat scats were collected from
   a treatment and non-treatment site before and following food
   supplementation. Percentage frequency occurrence of the different prey
   types was assessed for the two sites during each experimental phase.
   Conclusions. Stoats ate fewer ground weta and hares, the two most
   abundant prey types, when supplemental food was added. In contrast,
   consumption of mice remained relatively stable at both sites throughout
   the experiment, and the consumption of birds declined at both sites.
   Implications. Our experiment suggests that stoats may continue to eat
   scarce endemic prey at similar per capita rates even when alternative
   prey are available. However, endemic prey that are locally or regionally
   abundant may be indirectly impacted by fluctuations in alternative prey.}},

Volume = {{220}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{3546-3554}},
Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{Phenomenological approaches to model species migration are usually based
   on kernel-based methods. These methods require a good knowledge of the
   dispersal agent behaviour for a given species. They also calculate the
   location of individuals independently to each other (except the mother
   plant) and then suppress some of them according to additional
   interactions such as competition, facilitation and recruitment. In this
   paper, we propose to use a new phenomenological method, the Gibbs
   method, to model tree species migration at large scale. The Gibbs method
   handles the location of adult individuals in terms of pairwise
   interactions described by a potential function. This function summarizes
   the set of known and unknown factors determining the spatial
   distribution of the individuals (or cohorts). The principle of the Gibbs
   method is to minimize the sum of all pairwise interactions, also called
   the cost function, in order to optimize the spatial point pattern
   according to the chosen potential function.
   We compared dispersal models based on the non-homogeneous Gibbs method
   to several models based on kernel methods, and in detail with a
   leptokurtic kernel-based model. An elasticity test of the Gibbs-based
   dispersal model showed a strong dependence among the parameters and the
   key role of the potential of interaction in the dispersion obtained. We
   found important differences in the resulting patterns of migration
   between Gibbs-based and kernel-based models: Gibbs-based model generated
   more random point patterns, leading to more diversified migration
   pathways than kernel-based model. Finally, a semi-realistic application
   to paleo-landscapes showed that the Gibbs-based model was able to
   simulate the migration pathways of Fagus sylvatica during the Holocene
   more realistically than kernel-based models. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Fire regimes result from reciprocal interactions between vegetation and
   fire that may be further affected by other disturbances, including
   climate, landform, and terrain. In this paper, we describe fire and fuel
   extensions for the forest landscape simulation model, LANDIS-II, that
   allow dynamic interactions among fire, vegetation, climate, and
   landscape structure, and incorporate realistic fire characteristics
   (shapes, distributions, and effects) that can vary within and between
   fire events. We demonstrate the capabilities of the new extensions using
   two case study examples with very different ecosystem characteristics: a
   boreal forest system from central Labrador, Canada, and a mixed conifer
   system from the Sierra Nevada Mountains (California, USA). In Labrador,
   comparison between the more complex dynamic fire extension and a classic
   fire simulator based on a simple fire size distribution showed little
   difference in terms of mean fire rotation and potential severity, but
   cumulative burn patterns created by the dynamic fire extension were more
   heterogeneous due to feedback between fuel types and fire behavior.
   Simulations in the Sierra Nevada indicated that burn patterns were
   responsive to topographic features, fuel types, and an extreme weather
   scenario, although the magnitude of responses depended on elevation. In
   both study areas, simulated fire size and resulting fire rotation
   intervals were moderately sensitive to parameters controlling the
   curvilinear response between fire spread and weather, as well as to the
   assumptions underlying the correlation between weather conditions and
   fire duration. Potential fire severity was more variable within the
   Sierra Nevada landscape and also was more sensitive to the correlation
   between weather conditions and fire duration. The fire modeling approach
   described here should be applicable to questions related to climate
   change and disturbance interactions, particularly within locations
   characterized by steep topography, where temporally or spatially dynamic
   vegetation significantly influences spread rates, where fire severity is
   variable, and where multiple disturbance types of varying severities are
   common. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystems can alternate suddenly between contrasting persistent states
   due to internal processes or external drivers. It is important to
   understand the mechanisms by which these shifts occur, especially in
   exploited ecosystems. There have been several abrupt marine ecosystem
   shifts attributed either to fishing, recent climate change or a
   combination of these two drivers. We show that temperature has been an
   important driver of the trophodynamics of the North Sea, a heavily
   fished marine ecosystem, for nearly 50 years and that a recent
   pronounced change in temperature established a new ecosystem dynamic
   regime through a series of internal mechanisms. Using an end-to-end
   ecosystem approach that included primary producers, primary, secondary
   and tertiary consumers, and detritivores, we found that temperature
   modified the relationships among species through nonlinearities in the
   ecosystem involving ecological thresholds and trophic amplifications.
   Trophic amplification provides an alternative mechanism to positive
   feedback to drive an ecosystem towards a new dynamic regime, which in
   this case favours jellyfish in the plankton and decapods and
   detritivores in the benthos. Although overfishing is often held
   responsible for marine ecosystem degeneration, temperature can clearly
   bring about similar effects. Our results are relevant to ecosystem-based
   fisheries management (EBFM), seen as the way forward to manage exploited
   marine ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental flows were released to the Macquarie Marshes (similar to
   210,000 ha) in north-west NSW of Australia between October and December
   2005, inundating an estimated 24,600 ha of floodplain area. According to
   the flood pulse concept, the marsh floodplains would have stored large
   amounts of nutrients and carbon during dry antecedent conditions, which
   would be released into the overlaying flood water. Field studies were
   conducted in mid-December 2005 at two sites, one on open floodplain
   woodland with a sparse canopy of River Red Gum and ground cover
   dominated by saltbushes and the other on open floodplain with black
   roly-poly. At each site, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   planktonic bacteria and phytoplankton were monitored daily for a 6-day
   period from the overlaying water of a floodplain inundated by the
   environmental water release. Those in mesocosms deployed in situ,
   containing marsh floodplain sediments that had been inundated
   artificially, were also monitored. The mesocosm results from both the
   sites showed that release of nitrogen was rapid, attaining mean
   concentrations of total nitrogen of 3.7-14.8 mg l(-1), followed by more
   gradual increases in total phosphorus (mean concentrations 0.6-0.8 mg
   l(-1)) and DOC (26.1-50.2 mg l(-1)) within the 6-day experiment;
   planktonic microbial communities developed concomitantly with the
   increasing concentrations of nutrients and DOC, attaining mean densities
   of (6.0-6.9) x 10(6) cells ml(-1) of planktonic bacteria and (80.7-81.4)
   x 10(3) cells ml(-1) of phytoplankton; and for each site the overall
   measured condition of the mesocosm tended to approach that of the
   Marshes, over the course of the 6-day experiment. The present study
   (both observational and experimental) demonstrates that the floodplain
   sediments in the Marshes, which have been exposed to dry antecedent
   conditions, release nutrients and carbon to the overlaying flood water
   following inundation. These resources are thought to have been stored
   during the dry antecedent phase in accord with the flood pulse concept.
   Based on the mesocosm experiment, the released nutrients and carbon are
   in turn most likely to be used by microbial components, such as bacteria
   and algae, which develop within days of inundation of the floodplain
   sediments. Thus, environmental flow release provides potential for
   floodplains to attain a series of ecological responses including initial
   release of inorganic nutrients and dissolved organic matter and increase
   in planktonic bacteria and phytoplankton.}},

Abstract = {{In the United States, stream restoration is an increasing part of
   environmental and land management programs, particularly under the
   auspices of compensatory mitigation regulations. Markets and regulations
   surrounding stream mitigation are beginning to mirror those of the
   well-established wetland mitigation industry. Recent studies have shown
   that wetland mitigation programs commonly shift wetlands across space
   from urban to rural areas, thereby changing the functional
   characteristics and benefits of wetlands in the landscape. However, it
   is not yet known if stream mitigation mirrors this behavior, and if so,
   what effects this may have on landscape-scale ecological and
   hydrological processes. This project addresses three primary research
   questions. (1) What are the spatial relationships between stream and
   wetland impact and compensation sites as a result of regulations
   requiring stream and wetland mitigation in the State of North Carolina?
   (2) How do stream impacts come about due to the actions of different
   types of developers, and how do the characteristics of impacts sites
   compare with compensation sites? (3) To what extent does stream
   compensation relocate high-quality streams within the river network, and
   how does this affect localized (intrawatershed) loss or gain of aquatic
   resources? Using geospatial data collected from the North Carolina
   Division of Water Quality and the Army Corps of Engineers' Wilmington
   District, we analyzed the behavior of the North Carolina Ecosystem
   Enhancement Program in providing stream and wetland mitigation for the
   State of North Carolina. Our results suggest that this program provides
   mitigation (1) in different ways for different types of permittees; (2)
   at great distances (both Euclidean and within the stream network) from
   original impacts; (3) in significantly different places than impacts
   within watersheds; and (4) in many cases, in different watersheds from
   original impacts. Our analysis also reveals problems with regulator data
   collection, storage, and quality control. These results have significant
   implications given new federal requirements for ecological consistency
   within mitigation programs. Our results also indicate some of the
   landscape-scale implications of using market-based approaches to
   ecological restoration in general.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of sexual dimorphism has long been attributed to sexual
   selection, specifically as it would drive repeated gains of elaborate
   male traits. In contrast to this pattern, New World oriole species all
   exhibit elaborate male plumage, and the repeated gains of sexual
   dichromatism observed in the genus are due to losses of female
   elaboration. Interestingly, most sexually dichromatic orioles belong to
   migratory or temperate-breeding clades. Using character scoring and
   ancestral state reconstructions from two recent studies in Icterus, we
   tested a hypothesis of correlated evolution between migration and sexual
   dichromatism. We employed two discrete phylogenetic comparative
   approaches: the concentrated changes test and Pagel's discrete
   likelihood test. Our results show that the evolution of these traits is
   significantly correlated (CCT: uncorrected P < 0.05; ML: LRT = 12.470, P
   < 0.005). Indeed, our best model of character evolution suggests that
   gains of sexual dichromatism are 23 times more likely to occur in
   migratory taxa. This study demonstrates that a life-history trait with
   no direct relationship with sexual selection has a strong influence on
   the evolution of sexual dichromatism. We recommend that researchers
   further investigate the role of selection on elaborate female traits in
   the evolution of sexual dimorphism.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Applying Keeling plot techniques to derive delta 13C of respiratory
   input in a closed non-equilibrated chamber can lead to large errors
   because steady-state diffusion rules are violated in a non-steady-state
   environment. To avoid these errors, respiratory delta 13C can be derived
   using equilibrated closed chambers.
   2. We introduce a new method to obtain stem respired CO2 delta 13C
   (delta(st-r)) with closed equilibrated stem chambers (E-SC). We present
   a theoretical model describing the equilibration process, test the model
   against field data and find excellent agreement. The method is further
   tested by comparing it with closed non-equilibrated stem chambers
   (NE-SC); we found no difference between these methods.
   3. Our theoretical model to describe CO2 diffusion from the respiratory
   pool into the chamber and the equation to derive the delta 13C of the
   efflux are general. They could be applied to other ecosystem components
   (e.g. soils).
   4. Our method is easy to implement, cost effective, minimizes sources of
   error and allows for rigorous leak detection. One major limitation is
   its inability to detect rapid change; the equilibration process requires
   15 +/- 2 h. A second limitation is that it cannot be used for species
   that produce abundant pitch at sites of stem wounding (e.g. Pseudotsuga

Title = {{New multivariate tests for phylogenetic signal and trait correlations
   applied to ecophysiological phenotypes of nine Manglietia species}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1059-1069}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Phylogenetic signal - the similarity in trait values among
   phylogenetically related species - is pervasive for most types of traits
   in most organisms. Traits can often be categorized a priori into groups
   based on the level of biological organization, functional relations,
   developmental origins, or genetic underpinnings. Traits within such
   groups are often expected to be correlated and hence show similar levels
   of phylogenetic signal.
   2. We developed multivariate statistical methods to test for
   phylogenetic signal in groups of traits while also incorporating
   estimates of trait measurement error (including within-species
   variation) that can obscure phylogenetic signal. Simultaneously, these
   methods produce estimates of correlations between traits that are
   corrected for phylogenetic relationships among species.
   3. We applied these methods to data for 13 morphological and
   physiological traits gathered in a common-garden study of nine species
   of Manglietia (Magnoliaceae). The 13 traits fell into four groups: three
   traits involved photosynthesis {[}maximum net photosynthesis (A(max)),
   light saturation point (LSP), light compensation point]; three described
   leaf morphology (thickness of leaves, palisade tissue, sponge tissue);
   four related to plant growth (basal stem diameter, crown volume, leaf
   area, relative growth rate); and three measured thermal tolerance
   {[}critical temperature (T-ch), peak temperature (T-max), temperature of
   half-inactivation (T-50)]. We also constructed a molecular phylogeny for
   these species from 219 AFLP markers via maximum likelihood estimation
   under the assumption of sequential binary changes in DNA sequences.
   4. Of the 13 traits, only two photosynthesis traits (Amax and LSP)
   exhibited statistically detectable phylogenetic signal (P < 0.05) when
   analysed separately, whether using previously published univariate tests
   or our new univariate tests that incorporate measurement error. In
   contrast, multivariate analyses of the four trait groups, estimating
   simultaneously the phylogenetic signal for all traits and the
   correlations between traits, revealed a statistically significant
   phylogenetic signal for two of the four groups (photosynthesis and plant
   growth), comprising seven traits in total.
   5. Our results demonstrate that even when the number of species in a
   comparative study is small, resulting in low power for univariate tests,
   phylogenetic signal can nonetheless be detected with multivariate tests
   that incorporate measurement error. Furthermore, our simulations show
   that the joint estimation of phylogenetic signal and trait correlations
   can lead to better (less biased and more precise) estimates of both.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{P> Recent advances in occupancy estimation that adjust for imperfect
   detection have provided substantial improvements over traditional
   approaches and are receiving considerable use in applied ecology. To
   estimate and adjust for detectability, occupancy modelling requires
   multiple surveys at a site and requires the assumption of `closure'
   between surveys, i.e. no changes in occupancy between surveys.
   Violations of this assumption could bias parameter estimates; however,
   little work has assessed model sensitivity to violations of this
   assumption or how commonly such violations occur in nature.
   We apply a modelling procedure that can test for closure to two avian
   point-count data sets in Montana and New Hampshire, USA, that exemplify
   time-scales at which closure is often assumed. These data sets
   illustrate different sampling designs that allow testing for closure but
   are currently rarely employed in field investigations. Using a
   simulation study, we then evaluate the sensitivity of parameter
   estimates to changes in site occupancy and evaluate a power analysis
   developed for sampling designs that is aimed at limiting the likelihood
   of closure.
   Application of our approach to point-count data indicates that habitats
   may frequently be open to changes in site occupancy at time-scales
   typical of many occupancy investigations, with 71\% and 100\% of species
   investigated in Montana and New Hampshire respectively, showing
   violation of closure across time periods of 3 weeks and 8 days
   respectively.
   Simulations suggest that models assuming closure are sensitive to
   changes in occupancy. Power analyses further suggest that the modelling
   procedure we apply can effectively test for closure.
   Synthesis and applications. Our demonstration that sites may be open to
   changes in site occupancy over time-scales typical of many occupancy
   investigations, combined with the sensitivity of models to violations of
   the closure assumption, highlights the importance of properly addressing
   the closure assumption in both sampling designs and analysis.
   Furthermore, inappropriately applying closed models could have negative
   consequences when monitoring rare or declining species for conservation
   and management decisions, because violations of closure typically lead
   to overestimates of the probability of occurrence.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1219-1228}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{P>1. To ensure the successful detection, control and eradication of
   invasive plant species, we need information that can identify areas
   prone to invasions and criteria that can point out which particular
   populations may become foci of further spread. Specifically, our work
   aimed to develop statistical models that identify hotspots of invasive
   plant species and evaluate the conditions that give rise to successful
   populations of invasive species.
   2. We combined extensive data sets on invasive species richness and on
   species per cent ground cover, together with climate, local habitat and
   land cover data. We then estimated invasive species richness as a
   function of those environmental variables by developing a spatially
   explicit generalized linear model within a hierarchical Bayesian
   framework. In a second analysis, we used an ordinal logistic regression
   model to quantify invasive species abundance as a function of the same
   set of predictor variables.
   3. Our results show which locations in the studied region, north-eastern
   USA, are prone to plant species invasions given the combination of
   climatic and land cover conditions particular to the sites. Predictions
   were also generated under a range of climate scenarios forecasted for
   the region, which pointed out at an increase in invasive species
   incidence under the most moderate forecast. Predicted abundance for some
   of the most common invasive plant species, Berberis thumbergii,
   Celastrus orbiculatus, Euonymus alata, Elaeagnus umbellata and Rosa
   multiflora, allowed us to identify the specific conditions that promote
   successful population growth of these species, populations that could
   become foci of further spread.
   4.Synthesis and applications. Reliable predictions of plants' invasive
   potential are crucial for the successful implementation of control and
   eradication management plans. By following a multivariate approach the
   parameters estimated in this study can now be used on targeted locations
   to evaluate the risk of invasions given the local climate and landscape
   structure; they can also be applied under different climate scenarios
   and changing landscapes providing an array of possible outcomes. In
   addition, this modelling approach can be easily used in other regions
   and for other species.}},

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2251-2263}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   To determine whether different abundances of introduced species of
   Cinchona (Rubiaceae) affect species composition and facilitate species
   richness in managed tropical forests, to test whether any facilitative
   effects on understorey species depend on forest type, and to investigate
   whether facilitative effects can be attributed to the `substitutive
   facilitation model'.
   Location
   Makawao Forest Reserve on Maui, Hawai'i, USA.
   Methods
   Cinchona species (Cinchona pubescens and Cinchona calisaya) were mapped
   within various forest types. In three forest types (ageing Eucalyptus
   and Pinus plantations, and near-natural Acacia koa forests), we analysed
   environmental parameters (e.g. canopy cover, litter cover, pH value and
   soil depth) and the species composition of Cinchona-invaded and
   non-invaded plots; data were compared based on Cinchona cover and forest
   types. Habitat modelling for several endemic species and tree ferns was
   carried out to test whether Cinchona cover is an important variable for
   the probability of occurrence of these endemics.
   Results
   Cinchona species have naturalized mainly in Eucalyptus and Pinus
   plantations and Acacia koa forests and here add an additional shrub
   layer. In contrast to other studies, we revealed facilitative effects of
   Cinchona on native species within all forest types. Species richness is
   about 20\% higher in invaded plots than in non-invaded plots, and these
   show a nearly 50\% higher proportion of endemic species, including tree
   ferns. The proportion of endemics even increases with increasing
   Cinchona cover. For several endemics, Cinchona is found to be an
   important variable for the probability of occurrence, and the removal of
   Cinchona cover as an explanatory variable lowers the model fit. In
   addition to Cinchona, variables delineating vegetation structure and
   light availability have a strong effect on the model fit.
   Main conclusions
   In the structurally simplified Hawaiian forests studied, Cinchona
   facilitated endemic species in accordance with the `substitutive
   facilitation model'. This contrasts with the results of an earlier study
   in the naturally treeless Galapagos highlands, which revealed a sharp
   decrease in the abundance of endemics under Cinchona canopy. These
   results illustrate that, through the same structural change (addition of
   a vegetation layer), an invasive species may exert divergent effects
   across different ecosystem types. The facilitation of endemic
   understorey species by invasive tree species in managed forests leads to
   a dilemma in conservation but also to new perspectives for ecosystem
   restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   To reconstruct the last c. 7000 years of vegetation and climate change
   in an unusual region of modern Great Plains grassland and scarp woodland
   in south-east Colorado (USA), and to determine the late Holocene
   biogeography of Colorado pinon (Pinus edulis) at its easternmost extent,
   using a series of radiocarbon-dated packrat (Neotoma sp.) middens.
   Location
   The West Carrizo Canyon drains the Chaquaqua Plateau, a plateau that
   projects into the western extent of the southern Great Plains grasslands
   in south-eastern Colorado, USA. Elevations of the study sites are 1448
   to 1525 m a.s.l. Today the plateau is mostly Juniperus scopulorum-P.
   edulis woodland.
   Methods
   Plant macrofossils and pollen assemblages were analysed from 11
   14C-dated packrat middens. Ages ranged from 5990 yr bp (6839 cal. yr bp)
   to 280 yr bp (485 cal. yr bp).
   Results
   The results presented here provide information on the establishment and
   expansion of Juniperus-P. edulis woodland at its eastern limits. The
   analysis of both plant macrofossils and pollen from the 11 middens
   documents changes in plant communities over the last 7000 years, and the
   establishment of P. edulis at its easternmost limit. Though very minor
   amounts of P. edulis pollen occur as early as the middle Holocene, plant
   macrofossils were only recovered in middens dating after c. 480 cal. yr
   bp.
   Main conclusions
   Originally, midden research suggested a late glacial refuge to the
   north-east of the Carrizo Canyon site, and a middle Holocene expansion
   of P. edulis. Results reported here are consistent with a late Holocene
   expansion, here at its eastern limits, but noted elsewhere at its
   northern and north-eastern limits. In general, this late Holocene
   expansion is consistent with pollen data from sediments in Colorado and
   New Mexico, and suggests that P. edulis is still expanding its range at
   its present extremes. This has implications for further extension of its
   range due to changing climatic conditions in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Stable H isotope ratios (D/H, expressed as delta D) hold promise as an
   additional tool for elucidating food sources for consumers in aquatic
   ecosystems. We tested the applicability of delta D as a food source
   tracer in streams of New Brunswick, Canada. First, we analyzed delta D
   and delta(13)C in biofilm and terrestrial leaves and compared
   signal-to-noise ratios (variability within sources vs variability
   between sources) between the 2 elements. Signal-to-noise ratios were
   roughly similar, and 23 of the 31 sites had isotopically distinct food
   sources based on delta D compared to 20 of 31 based on delta(13)C.
   Second, we used mixing models to estimate \% aquatic H and \% aquatic C
   for benthic invertebrates at a subset of sites. of 16 samples, only 1
   had delta(13)C that was outside the range of the 2 food sources
   (yielding \% aquatic C > 100\%), but 12 of the 16 samples had delta D
   outside the range of the food sources, a result suggesting confounding
   effects of water and lipids on total body H content. Last, we analyzed
   delta D in laboratory-reared consumers (brook trout and water striders)
   and in their diet before and after lipid extraction to estimate
   diet-tissue fractionation. Large differences between consumer and diet
   were apparent before lipid extraction, but no significant differences
   were found after lipid extraction. All of these measures indicate that
   delta D could serve as a complementary, but not alternative, isotopic
   method for estimating food sources for consumers in streams. Further
   laboratory trials are needed to explore the influence of lipids on delta
   D values.}},

Abstract = {{Knowing what an animal is doing where and when is Crucial for
   Understanding habitat use as well as for detecting deviations from the
   norm, e.g. the animal's responses to disturbances or predators. While an
   animal's position can quite easily be assigned using VHF- or
   GPS-telemetry, determining its behaviour from a distance is still
   limited. A new generation of GPS-collars, equipped with a dual-axis
   acceleration sensor allows insights into the animal activity by
   continuously (5-minute intervals) delivering x- and y-values on a scale
   from 0 to 255. However, until now it has not been possible to tell which
   activity values can be attributed to which kind of behaviour. Therefore,
   the overall aim of our study was to find a method to distinguish
   different behavioural categories from these activity values. We used
   four captive red deer Cervus elaphus (one male and three females) and
   equipped them with GPS- while simultaneously observing their behaviour.
   Values for different behavioural categories were compared statistically
   using ANOVA with `individual' as random effect and Tukey's follow-up
   test. Threshold values between the categories were determined by
   recursive partitioning and were assured by 5,000 bootstraps. White the
   difference between feeding and slow locomotion was significant in the x-
   but not in the y-values, each of these two categories differed
   significantly from resting and fast locomotion. Specific thresholds were
   established between the three categories resting, feeding with slow
   locomotion and fast locomotion. Subsequent comparison of the behaviour
   determined by these threshold values with observed behaviour revealed a
   high percentage of-correctly assigned behaviour (93\%). Taken together,
   this preliminary Study demonstrates the potential of dual-axis
   acceleration sensors in GPS-collars for estimating the activity of
   wild-living red deer. However, further observations of activity on more
   individuals of each age and sex class should be performed to take into
   account inter-individual variability and to improve the predictive power
   of the threshold values.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem components interact in complex ways and change over time due
   to a variety of both internal and external influences (climate change,
   season cycles, human impacts). Such processes need to be modeled
   dynamically using appropriate statistical methods for assessing change
   in network structure. Here we use visualizations and statistical models
   of network dynamics to understand seasonal changes in the trophic
   network model described by Baird and Ulanowicz {[}Baird, D., Ulanowicz,
   R.E., 1989. Seasonal dynamics of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. Ecol.
   Monogr. 501 (59), 329-364] for the Chesapeake Bay (USA). Visualizations
   of carbon flow networks were created for each season by using a network
   graphic analysis tool (NETDRAW). The structural relations of the pelagic
   and benthic compartments (nodes) in each seasonal network were displayed
   in a two-dimensional space using spring-embedder analyses with nodes
   color-coded for habitat associations (benthic or pelagic). The most
   complex network was summer, when pelagic species such as sea nettles,
   larval fishes, and carnivorous fishes immigrate into Chesapeake Bay and
   consume prey largely from the plankton and to some extent the benthos.
   Winter was the simplest of the seasonal networks, and exhibited the
   highest ascendency, with fewest nodes present and with most of the flows
   shifting to the benthic bacteria and sediment POC compartments. This
   shift in system complexity corresponds with a shift from a pelagic- to
   benthic-dominated system over the seasonal cycle, suggesting that winter
   is a mostly closed system, relying on internal cycling rather than
   external input. Network visualization tools are useful in assessing
   temporal and spatial changes in food web networks, which can be explored
   for patterns that can be tested using statistical approaches. A
   simulation-based continuous-time Markov Chain model called SIENA was
   used to determine the dynamic structural changes in the trophic network
   across phases of the annual cycle in a statistical as opposed to a
   visual assessment. There was a significant decrease in outdegree (prey
   nodes with reduced link density) and an increase in the number of
   transitive triples (a triad in which i chooses j and h, and j also
   chooses h, mostly connected via the non-living detritus nodes in
   position i), suggesting the Chesapeake Bay is a simpler, but
   structurally more efficient, ecosystem in the winter than in the summer.
   As in the visual analysis, this shift in system complexity corresponds
   with a shift from a pelagic to a more benthic-dominated system from
   summer to winter. Both the SIENA model and the visualization in NETDRAW
   support the conclusions of Baird and Ulanowicz {[}Baird, D., Ulanowicz,
   R.E., 1989. Seasonal dynamics of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. Ecol.
   Monogr. 501 (59),329-364] that there was an increase in the Chesapeake
   Bay ecosystem's ascendancy in the winter. We explain such reduced
   complexity in winter as a system response to lowered temperature and
   decreased solar energy input, which causes a decline in the production
   of new carbon, forcing nodes to go extinct; this causes a change in the
   structure of the system, making it simpler and more efficient than in
   summer. It appears that the seasonal dynamics of the trophic structure
   of Chesapeake Bay can be modeled effectively using the SIENA statistical
   model for network change. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two issues in ecological network theory are: (1) how to construct an
   ecological network model and (2) how do entire networks (as opposed to
   individual species) adapt to changing conditions? We present a novel
   method for constructing an ecological network model for the food web of
   southeastern Lake Michigan (USA) and we identify changes in key system
   properties that are large relative to their uncertainty as this
   ecological network adapts from one time point to a second time point in
   response to multiple perturbations. To construct our food web for
   southeastern Lake Michigan, we followed the list of seven
   recommendations outlined in Cohen et al. {[}Cohen, J.E.,et al., 1993.
   Improving food webs. Ecology 74, 252-258] for improving food webs. We
   explored two inter-related extensions of hierarchical system theory with
   our food web; the first one was that subsystems react to perturbations
   independently in the short-term and the second one was that a system's
   properties change at a slower rate than its subsystems' properties. We
   used Shannon's equations to provide quantitative versions of the basic
   food web properties: number of prey, number of predators, number of
   feeding links, and connectance (or density). We then compared these
   properties between the two time-periods by developing distributions of
   each property for each time period that took uncertainty about the
   property into account. We compared these distributions, and concluded
   that non-overlapping distributions indicated changes in these properties
   that were large relative to their uncertainty. Two subsystems were
   identified within our food web system structure (p < 0.001). One
   subsystem had more non-overlapping distributions in food web properties
   between Time 1 and Time 2 than the other subsystem. The overall system
   had all overlapping distributions in food web properties between Time I
   and Time 2. These results supported both extensions of hierarchical
   systems theory. Interestingly, the subsystem with more non-overlapping
   distributions in food web properties was the subsystem that contained
   primarily benthic taxa, contrary to expectations that the identified
   major perturbations (lower phosphorous inputs and invasive species)
   would more greatly affect the subsystem containing primarily pelagic
   taxa. Future food-web research should employ rigorous statistical
   analysis and incorporate uncertainty in food web properties for a better
   understanding of how ecological networks adapt. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

   structure and function. Yet, few contemporary approaches can assess the
   effects of exotic species invasion at such an inclusive level. Our
   research presents one of the first attempts to examine the effects of an
   exotic species at the ecosystem level in a quantifiable manner. We used
   ecological network analysis (ENA) and a social network analysis (SNA)
   method called cohesion analysis to examine the effect of zebra mussel
   (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion on the Oneida Lake, New York, USA, food
   web. We used ENA to quantify ecosystem function through an analysis of
   food web carbon transfer that explicitly incorporated flow over all food
   web paths (direct and indirect). The cohesion analysis assessed
   ecosystem structure through an organization of food web members into
   subgroups of strongly interacting predators and prey. Our analysis
   detected effects of zebra mussel invasion throughout the entire Oneida
   Lake food web, including changes in trophic flow efficiency (i.e.,
   carbon flow among trophic levels) and alterations of food web
   organization (i.e., paths of carbon flow) and ecosystem activity (i.e.,
   total carbon flow). ENA indicated that zebra mussels altered food web
   function by shunting carbon from pelagic to benthic pathways, increasing
   dissipative flow loss, and decreasing ecosystem activity. SNA revealed
   the strength of zebra mussel perturbation as evidenced by a
   reorganization of food web subgroup structure, with a decrease in
   importance of pelagic pathways, a concomitant rise of benthic pathways,
   and a reorganization of interactions between top predator fish.
   Together, these analyses allowed for a holistic understanding of the
   effects of zebra mussel invasion on the Oneida Lake food web. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{It is a current challenge to better understand the relative importance
   of species in ecosystems, and the network perspective is able to offer
   quantitative tools for this. It is plausible to assume, in general, that
   well-linked species, being key interactors, are also more important for
   the community. Recently a number of methods have been suggested for
   quantifying the network position of species in ecological networks (like
   the topological importance metric, TI). Most of them are based on node
   centrality indices and it may happen that the two most important species
   in a food web have very similar interaction structure and they can
   essentially replace each other if one becomes extinct. For conservation
   considerations it is a challenge to identify species that are richly
   connected and, at the same time, have a relatively unique and
   irreplaceable interaction pattern. We present a new method and
   illustrate our approach by using the Kuosheng Bay trophic network in
   Taiwan. The new method is based on the interaction matrix, where the
   strength of the interaction between nodes i and j depends only on
   topology. By defining a threshold separating weak and strong
   interactors, we define the effective range of interactions for each
   graph node. If the overlaps between pairs of these ranges are
   quantified, we gain a metric expressing how unique is the interaction
   pattern of a focal node (TO). The combination of centrality (TI) and
   uniqueness (TO) is called topological functionality (TF). We compare the
   nodal importance rank provided by this metric to others based on a
   variety of centrality measures. The main conclusion is that shrimps seem
   to have the most unique interaction pattern despite that their
   structural importance has been underestimated by all conventional
   centrality indices. Also, our network analysis suggests that fisheries
   disturb the ecosystem in a more critical network position than the
   impingement by the local power plant. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The simultaneous accounting of effects of natural and anthropogenic
   changes within a common framework calls for the development of new
   comprehensive tools capable of integrating biological processes that
   span a huge range of scales, from viruses to fishes, in addition to
   their interactions with physical-chemical environmental properties, i.e.
   End-to-End models.
   Here we propose an approach to model integration in which two models are
   not coupled by using the output of first model as a forcing of the
   second model and vice versa, but an approach in which the two models
   work separately and the output of one model is used to constrain the
   trajectory of the other, as in Data Assimilation methodology. This
   methodology is employed for integrating the biogeochemical processes as
   described in a coupled transport-biogeochemical model into an Ecopath
   with Ecosim food web model, using the Lagoon of Venice as a case study.
   The integrated End-to-End model reproduces the multi-annual time
   dynamics of the lower trophic levels as obtained by the biogeochemical
   model and, when run in a 2D grid, produces steady state distributions of
   high trophic level groups that agree with observed gradients. The
   research highlights the important contribution of higher trophic level
   dynamic to the flows related to organic non-living pools as well as the
   great influence inorganic nutrients in shaping the time-space patterns
   of higher trophic level organisms, thereby confirming the importance of
   pursuing an integrated End-to-End approach to marine ecosystem study.
   We argue that modular approach to End-to-End modelling is efficient but
   that model closure terms should be modified before integration. The
   quasi-modular approach proposed here meets these requirements while
   maintaining the advantages of using existing models. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Although predator-prey cycles can be easily predicted with mathematical
   models it is only since recently that oscillations observed in a
   chemostat predator-prey (rotifer-algal) experiment offer an interesting
   workbench for testing model soundness. These new observations have
   highlighted the limitations of the conventional modelling approach in
   correctly reproducing some unexpected characteristics of the cycles.
   Simulations are improved when changes in algal community structure,
   resulting from natural selection operating on an assemblage of algal
   clones differing in competitive ability and defence against rotifer
   predation, is considered in multi-prey models. This approach, however,
   leads to extra complexity in terms of state variables and parameters. We
   show here that multi-prey models with one predator can be effectively
   approximated with a simpler (only a few differential equations) model
   derived in the context of adaptive dynamics and obtained with a
   moment-based approximation. The moment-based approximation has been
   already discussed in the literature but mostly in a theoretical context,
   therefore we focus on the strength of this approach in downscaling model
   complexity by relating it to the chemostat predator-prey experiment.
   Being based on mechanistic concepts, our modelling framework can be
   applied to any community of competing species for which a trade-off
   between competitive ability and resistance to predators can be
   appropriately defined. We suggest that this approach can be of great
   benefit for reducing complexity in biogeochemical modelling studies at
   the basin or global ocean scale. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent developments in ecological statistics have reached behavioral
   ecology, and an increasing number of studies now apply analytical tools
   that incorporate alternatives to the conventional null hypothesis
   testing based on significance levels. However, these approaches continue
   to receive mixed support in our field. Because our statistical choices
   can influence research design and the interpretation of data, there is a
   compelling case for reaching consensus on statistical philosophy and
   practice. Here, we provide a brief overview of the recently proposed
   approaches and open an online forum for future discussion
   (https://bestat.ecoinformatics.org). From the perspective of practicing
   behavioral ecologists relying on either correlative or experimental
   data, we review the most relevant features of information theoretic
   approaches, Bayesian inference, and effect size statistics. We also
   discuss concerns about data quality, missing data, and repeatability. We
   emphasize the necessity of moving away from a heavy reliance on
   statistical significance while focusing attention on biological
   relevance and effect sizes, with the recognition that uncertainty is an
   inherent feature of biological data. Furthermore, we point to the
   importance of integrating previous knowledge in the current analysis,
   for which novel approaches offer a variety of tools. We note, however,
   that the drawbacks and benefits of these approaches have yet to be
   carefully examined in association with behavioral data. Therefore, we
   encourage a philosophical change in the interpretation of statistical
   outcomes, whereas we still retain a pluralistic perspective for making
   objective statistical choices given the uncertainties around different
   approaches in behavioral ecology. We provide recommendations on how
   these concepts could be made apparent in the presentation of statistical
   outputs in scientific papers.}},

Abstract = {{Most plant and animal populations have substantial interannual
   variability in survival, growth rate, and fecundity. They also exhibit
   substantial variability among individuals in traits such as size, age,
   condition, and disease status that have large impacts on individual
   fates and consequently on the future of the population. We present here
   methods for constructing and analyzing a stochastic integral projection
   model (IPM) incorporating both of these forms of variability,
   illustrated through a case study of the monocarpic thistle Carlina
   vulgaris. We show how model construction can exploit the close
   correspondence between stochastic IPMs and statistical analysis of
   trait-fate relationships in a ``mixed{''} or ``hierarchical{''} models
   framework. This correspondence means that IPMs can be parameterized
   straightforwardly from data using established statistical techniques and
   software (vs. the largely ad hoc methods for stochastic matrix models),
   properly accounting for sampling error and between-year sample size
   variation and with vastly fewer parameters than a conventional
   stochastic matrix model. We show that the many tools available for
   analyzing stochastic matrix models (such as stochastic growth rate,
   lambda(S), small variance approximations, elasticity/sensitivity
   analysis, and life table response experiment {[}LTRE] analysis) can be
   used for IPMs, and we give computational formulas for
   elasticity/sensitivity analyses. We develop evolutionary analyses based
   on the connection between growth rate sensitivity and selection
   gradients and present a new method using techniques from functional data
   analysis to study the evolution of function-valued traits such as
   size-dependent flowering probability. For Carlina we found consistent
   selection against variability in both state-specific transition rates
   and the fitted functions describing state dependence in demographic
   rates. For most of the regression parameters de. ning the IPM there was
   also selection against temporal variance; however, in some cases the
   effects of nonlinear averaging were big enough to favor increased
   temporal variation. The LTRE analysis identified year-to-year variation
   in survival as the dominant factor in population growth variability.
   Evolutionary analysis of flowering strategy showed that the entire
   functional relationship between plant size and flowering probability is
   at or near an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) shaped by the
   size-specific trade-off between the benefit (fecundity) and cost
   (mortality) of flowering in a temporally varying environment.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the recognition of the importance of seasonal forcing in nature,
   remarkably few studies have theoretically explored periodically forced
   community dynamics. Here we employ a novel approach called
   ``successional state dynamics'' (SSD) to model a seasonally forced
   predator-prey system. We first generated analytical predictions of the
   effects of altered seasonality on species persistence and the timing of
   community state transitions. We then parameterized the model using a
   zooplankton-phytoplankton system and tested quantitative predictions
   using controlled experiments. In the majority of cases, timing of
   zooplankton and algal population peaks matched model predictions.
   Decreases in growing-period length delayed algal blooms, consequently
   delaying peaks in zooplankton abundance. Predictions of increased
   probability of predator extinction at low growing-period lengths were
   also upheld experimentally. Our results highlight the utility of the SSD
   modeling approach as a framework for predicting the effects of altered
   seasonality on the structure and dynamics of multitrophic communities.}},

Abstract = {{Climate warming is expected to shift bioclimatic zones and plant species
   distribution. Yet, few studies have explored whether seedling
   establishment is a possible bottleneck for future migration and
   population resilience. We test how warming affects the early stages of
   seedling establishment in 10 plant species in subarctic tundra. To zoom
   into the life phases where the effects of warming actually take place,
   we used a novel approach of breaking down the whole-season warming
   effect into full factorial combination of early-, mid-, and late-season
   warming periods. Seeds were sown in containers placed under field
   conditions in subarctic heath and were exposed to 3 degrees C elevation
   of surface temperature and 30\% addition of summer precipitation
   relative to ambient. Heating was achieved with Free Air Temperature
   Increase systems. Whole-season heating reduced germination and
   establishment, significantly in four out of 10 species. The whole-season
   warming effect originated from additive effects of individual periods,
   although some of the periods had disproportionally stronger influence.
   Early-germinating species were susceptible to warming; the critical
   phases were early summer for germination and mid summer for seedling
   survival. Graminoids, which emerged later, were less susceptible
   although some negative effects during late summer were observed. Some
   species with intermediate germination time were affected by all periods
   of warming. Addition of water generally could not mitigate the negative
   effects of whole-season heating, but at individual species level both
   strengthening and amelioration of these negative effects were observed.
   We conclude that summer warming is likely to constrain seedling
   recruitment in open micro sites, which is a common seed regeneration
   niche in tundra ecosystem. Importantly, we described both significant
   temporal and species-specific variation in the sensitivity of seedling
   establishment to warming which needs to be taken into consideration when
   modelling population dynamics and vegetation transitions in a warmer
   climate.}},

Abstract = {{Over the period from 1994 to 2007, air and water temperatures in the
   Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) increased while rainfall and
   river flows declined. Data on the occurrence of stream macroinvertebrate
   families in bioassessment samples collected in NSW during this period
   were examined to see whether a biological response to these climatic and
   hydrological trends could be discerned. Multiple logistic regression was
   used to test for long-term trends in the probability of detection of
   individual macroinvertebrate families within the samples, taking account
   of the latitude, longitude, altitude, hydraulic habitat, time of year
   and subsampling method associated with each sample. Of the 124 families
   and family groups tested, 33 had statistically significant increasing
   trends, 37 had significantly declining trends and 54 had no significant
   trend; however, many of the last group were seldom collected and their
   trend estimates had wide confidence limits. Significant relationships
   were found between the thermophily and rheophily of the families and the
   estimated strength and direction of their long-term trends, with
   families that favour colder waters and faster-flowing habitats more
   likely to have declined. Although many families showed trends of
   increasing detection within samples, such trends do not necessarily
   equate to increasing prevalence in the environment because the extent of
   wetted habitat has probably declined, especially flowing habitat. In
   addition, because of likely intrafamilial trait diversity, increasing or
   apparently increasing families may include species in decline. Many
   freshwater macroinvertebrate species in NSW may be threatened by
   anthropogenic climate change, exacerbated by water withdrawals. The
   thermal tolerances, rheophily and other pertinent traits of individual
   species need to be determined to identify those most at risk.}},

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1223-1236}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The increasing availability of spatial micro data offers new potential
   for understanding the micro foundations of urban spatial dynamics.
   However, because urban systems are complex, induction alone is
   insufficient. Nonlinearities and path dependence imply that
   qualitatively new dynamics can emerge due to stochastic shocks or
   threshold effects. Given the policy needs for managing urban growth and
   decline and the growing desire for sustainable urban forms, models must
   be able not only to explain empirical regularities, but also
   characterize system-level dynamics and assess the plausible range of
   outcomes under alternative scenarios. Towards this end, we discuss a
   comprehensive modeling approach that is comprised of bottom-up and
   top-down models in which both inductive and deductive approaches are
   used to describe and explain urban spatial dynamics. We propose that
   this comprehensive modeling approach consists of three iterative tasks:
   (1) identify empirical regularities in the spatial pattern dynamics of
   key meso and macro variables; (2) explain these regularities with
   process-based micro models that link individual behavior to the
   emergence of meso and macro dynamics; and (3) determine the systems
   dynamical equations that characterize the relationships between micro
   processes and meso and macro pattern dynamics. Along the way, we also
   clarify types of complexity (input and output) and discuss dimensions of
   complexity (spatial, temporal, and behavioral). While no one to date has
   achieved this kind of comprehensive modeling, meaningful progress has
   been made in characterizing and explaining urban spatial dynamics. We
   highlight examples of this work from the recent literature and conclude
   with a discussion of key challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing global temperatures as a result of climate change are widely
   considered inevitable for Australia. Despite this, the specific effects
   of climate change on Australian agriculture are little studied and the
   effects on agricultural pests and diseases are virtually unknown. In
   this paper we consider the impact of climate change on the Asiatic
   citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama {[}Hemiptera: Psyllidae]); one
   of two known vectors of huanglongbing (citrus greening); a debilitating
   disease which is caused in Asia by a phloem-limited bacterium
   `Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (alpha-Proteobacteria). D. citri
   does not occur in Australia, but if introduced would pose a major threat
   to the viability of the Australian citrus industry and to native Citrus
   species. This paper presents an approach developed to understand how
   climate change may influence the behaviour, distribution and breeding
   potential of D. citri. Here we developed and describe an initial dynamic
   point model of D. citri biology in relation to its citrus host and
   applied it to a scenario of increasing temperatures, as indicators of
   climate change, on a continental scale. A comparison between model
   outputs for the three time frames considered (1990,2030 and 2070)
   confirms that increasing temperatures projected under climate change
   will affect the timing and duration of new citrus growth (flush)
   necessary for psyllid development throughout Australia. Flushing will
   start progressively earlier as the temperature increases and be of
   shorter duration. There will also be a gradual southward expansion of
   shorter durations of the occurrence of flush. Increasing temperatures
   will impact on D. citri both directly through alteration of its
   temperature dependant development cycle and indirectly through the
   impact on the host flushing cycle. For the whole of Australia, a
   comparison between model outputs for the three scenarios considered
   indicates the seasonality of D. citri development will change to match
   changes in citrus flush initiation. Results indicate that the risk of
   establishment by D. citri is projected to decrease under increasing
   temperatures, mainly due to shortened intervals when it can feed on new
   leaf flushes of the host. However, the spatially heterogeneous results
   also suggest that regions located on the southern coastline of Australia
   could become more suitable for D. citri than projected under current
   temperatures. These results confirm the value of a linked host-pest
   approach as based on D. citri climatic requirements alone the model
   would have accounted only for shorter development periods and predicted
   an increased risk of potential distribution. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Statistical theories of animal movement have often been based on models
   of random walks, where movements take place in discrete steps and occur
   at discrete times. The multiplicity of distributions required in these
   approaches to describe animal movement (i.e., the distributions of
   angles, discrete steps, and times) have effects that cannot be simply
   disentangled, and hence they cannot be unambiguously determined. Here we
   present a mathematical formulation of continuous animal movements. In
   this new framework, it is shown that a single time-dependent distance
   statistic, the mean square displacement, which may be directly measured
   or mathematically modeled, is a central determinant of such random walks
   and encapsulates key information about the statistical properties of
   animal movements. The model and methodology presented here not only
   allow the determination of what were previously viewed as independent
   aspects of animal movements, such as the distribution of angular changes
   in direction, but also, because of the new emphasis on the mean square
   displacement, they may open up a new set of questions concerning animal
   movement and related phenomena. The results established in this work are
   directly applied to the foraging behavior of Pharaoh's ants, and very
   close agreement is found between observation and theory.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenically-induced climate change is one of the most important
   global threats to biodiversity. Understanding its impact on the
   distribution of exotic plant species is critical for developing
   effective adaptation and management strategies. However, there is
   insufficient information currently available on the biodiversity at risk
   from 1) exotic plant invasions, 2) climate change, and 3) the
   interaction between these two major threats, to develop such strategies.
   We use ecological niche models as a first step to identify zones inside
   and outside Australian protected areas that may be most at risk from
   invasions of three species of Hieracium (hawkweeds) under current and
   future (2030 and 2070) climate scenarios, should current control and
   eradication methods fail. These perennial herbs are native to Europe and
   invasive to New Zealand and North America. Naturalised in Australia,
   hawkweeds threaten native tussock grasslands and the grazing industry,
   and have been placed on the National Alert List. Using eight ecological
   niche models currently available in the software package BIOMOD, we
   found that these species have yet to realize the extent of their
   climatic distribution under present day climate in Australia. As climate
   change accelerates, the climatic range of hawkweeds was projected to
   contract overall. However, much of the Australian Alps, which contain
   large contiguous tracts of reserves and many endemic species, will
   continue to retain climatically suitable areas for hawkweeds through to
   2070. These results emphasise the need for ongoing monitoring as well as

Abstract = {{Papilio swallowtail butterflies exhibit a remarkable diversity of
   Batesian mimicry, manifested in several sex-limited and polymorphic
   types. There is little understanding of how this diversity is
   distributed within Papilio, and how different mimicry types have evolved
   in relation to each other. To answer these questions, I present a
   graphical model that connects various mimicry types by hypothetical
   character state changes within a phylogenetic framework. A maximum
   likelihood analysis of evolution of mimicry types on the Papilio
   phylogeny showed that sexually monomorphic mimicry and female-limited
   mimicry have evolved repeatedly but predominantly independently in
   different clades. However, transitions between these mimicry types are
   rarely observed. The frequency distribution of character state changes
   was skewed in favor of the evolution of mimicry, whereas many
   theoretically plausible character state changes, especially evolutionary
   loss of mimicry, were not evident. I discuss these findings in relation
   to studying the tempo of evolutionary change, loss of traits, and
   directionality and connectivity among character states. The pathway
   approach and phylogenetic patterns of mimicry demonstrated in Papilio
   are useful to test novel hypotheses regarding the diversity and

Abstract = {{Today, many seabird species nest in port areas, which are also necessary
   for human economic activity. In this paper, we evaluate, using a
   metapopulation model, the possibilities for creating alternative
   breeding sites for the Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) in the
   Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt estuary. We explore 22 scenarios that differ with
   respect to (1) loss of breeding habitat in port areas, (2) location and
   size of newly created habitat, and (3) coexistence of old and new
   habitat. Results indicate that loss of port area habitats results in a
   serious 41\% decline in the breeding population. When the loss in ports
   is compensated for within the ports, the decline was negligible.
   Fourteen scenarios result in an increase of the Common Tern
   metapopulation. In these, extra breeding habitat is created outside the
   ports in fish-rich waters, resulting in a potential metapopulation
   increase of 25\%. However, the period of overlap between lost and newly
   created habitat strongly affects the results. A gap between the removal
   of old and the creation of new breeding areas might cause a drop in the
   metapopulation level of 30\%. The population recovery from this drop
   might take more than 100 years due to slow recolonization. Our results
   suggest that conservation of seabird species should be evaluated on a
   metapopulation scale and that the creation of new habitat may help to
   compensate for habitat loss in other areas. Furthermore, the results
   indicate that overlap between the existence of old and newly created
   breeding habitats is crucial for the success of compensation efforts.
   However, new locations should be carefully selected, because not only is
   the suitability of the breeding grounds important, but ample fish
   availability nearby is also key.}},

Abstract = {{Female song is much more prevalent in tropical than in temperate
   songbirds but, we know surprisingly little about the evolutionary

   life-history characters: social mating system, nesting pattern, and
   migratory behavior. Reconstructions using both parsimony and maximum

   this clade and that tropical ancestors with frequent female song almost
   invariably were monogamous, had dispersed nest sites, and were
   nonmigratory. Losses of female song were not consistently associated
   with changes in any single life-history characteristic across the
   family, but rather appear to have occurred for different reasons in
   different lineages, including the evolution of migration in the oriole
   genus (Icterus), the evolution of brood parasitism in the cowbirds
   (Molothrus), and the evolution of polygynous, colonial breeding in the
   oropendolas (Psarocolius, Gymnostinops) and caciques (Cacicus). These

Abstract = {{Aim
   Artificial water points are often used in protected savanna ecosystems
   to maintain populations of large herbivores. However, these
   interventions lead to increased ranging and foraging pressure and can
   negatively impact important habitats and species. This study
   investigated the influence of artificial water provision on the foraging
   and movement paths of an African elephant population and modelled the
   impact of changing water availability on sensitive habitat types.
   Location
   Tembe Elephant Park (TEP), KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
   Methods
   We mapped and classified 414 km of elephant movement and foraging paths
   in a 300-km(2) fenced protected area. The data were analysed to
   determine the relationship between path size, distribution and distance
   to water. We also used a logistic modelling approach to explore the
   predicted effects of removing artificial water points on path
   distribution.
   Results
   Elephant paths were unevenly distributed throughout the habitats of TEP
   and the most established and heavily used paths were found closest to
   water. We also discovered a number of elephant `rest areas' along the
   paths, which were distinct clearings that tended to be close to water
   and in sand forest habitat. Our model predicted that the removal of
   artificial water points would reduce the area crossed by elephant paths
   by 79\%, leading to an 89\% reduction in the presence of elephant paths
   in sand forest.
   Main conclusions
   Our study provides further evidence that manipulating surface water
   availability can be a useful tool for managing large herbivore impacts
   on vegetation and acts as the basis for further research on the
   trade-offs between conservation objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   Non-indigenous species pose a significant threat to the environment and
   to global economies. Predictive and preventative measures are widely
   considered more effective in curtailing invasions than are eradication
   or control measures. Of key importance in the prediction of regional
   invasion risk are the environmental conditions that enable successful
   establishment.
   Location
   We surveyed native and non-indigenous sessile invertebrate diversity in
   each of two commercial (600-1500 vessels per year) and two recreational
   estuaries (seven to nine marinas) in New South Wales, Australia.
   Methods
   A nested hierarchical design was employed to investigate variation in
   sessile invertebrate diversity at the scales of site (1-3 km apart) and
   estuary (40-180 km apart). Settlement plates (15 x 15 cm) were used to
   sample invertebrates and background heavy metal loads were assessed
   using bioaccumulation in experimentally deployed oysters. Other
   physico-chemical variables were monitored monthly. Manipulative
   experiments were used to test the direct effects of exposure to copper
   and tributyltin (TBT) antifouling paints on sessile invertebrates.
   Results
   Native and non-indigenous species richness differed at various spatial
   scales, but showed no consistent difference between commercial and
   recreational estuaries. Instead, individual species distributions were
   strongly related to metal contamination, temperature, turbidity and pH.
   In experimental studies, several species (mostly invaders) were more
   abundant on plates exposed to copper and/or TBT antifouling paints. We
   found higher levels of copper (and in some instances TBT) in
   recreational marinas than in commercial harbours.
   Main conclusions
   Our results demonstrate the importance of metal pollution and
   physico-chemical variables in the establishment of invaders in new
   regions. We have identified several native Australian species that have
   been exported overseas and suggested mechanisms contributing to their
   transport and establishment. Combining physico-chemical information
   about donor and recipient regions with species tolerances could go some
   way to predicting where future invasions may occur.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   The exotic annual cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is fast replacing
   sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) communities throughout the Great Basin
   Desert and nearby regions in the Western United States, impacting native
   plant communities and altering fire regimes, which contributes to the
   long-term persistence of this weedy species. The effect of this
   conversion on native faunal communities remains largely unexamined. We
   assess the impact of conversion from native perennial to exotic annual
   plant communities on desert rodent communities.
   Location
   Wyoming big sagebrush shrublands and nearby sites previously converted
   to cheatgrass-dominated annual grasslands in the Great Basin Desert,
   Utah, USA.
   Methods
   At two sites in Tooele County, Utah, USA, we investigated with Sherman
   live trapping whether intact sagebrush vegetation and nearby converted
   Bromus tectorum-dominated vegetation differed in rodent abundance,
   diversity and community composition.
   Results
   Rodent abundance and species richness were considerably greater in
   sagebrush plots than in cheatgrass-dominated plots. Nine species were
   captured in sagebrush plots; five of these were also trapped in
   cheatgrass plots, all at lower abundances than in the sagebrush. In
   contrast, cheatgrass-dominated plots had no species that were not found
   in sagebrush. In addition, the site that had been converted to
   cheatgrass longer had lower abundances of rodents than the site more
   recently converted to cheatgrass-dominated plots. Despite large
   differences in abundances and species richness, Simpson's D diversity
   and Shannon-Wiener diversity and Brillouin evenness indices did not
   differ between sagebrush and cheatgrass-dominated plots.
   Main conclusions
   This survey of rodent communities in native sagebrush and in converted
   cheatgrass-dominated vegetation suggests that the abundances and
   community composition of rodents may be shifting, potentially at the
   larger spatial scale of the entire Great Basin, where cheatgrass
   continues to invade and dominate more landscape at a rapid rate.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, definitions and measures of complexity with regard to
   biological communities are briefly considered. A new topological
   approach that considers the community's complexity in terms of groups of
   species coherently varied in space or time is proposed. For a given set
   of samples, the number of such groups is related to the minimal number M
   of axes necessary to represent the original configuration of the data
   set. I interpret this ``minimal dimensionality of structure{''} as the
   number of independent factors of structural variability and its
   normalized value M/M(MAX) as a measure of the organizational complexity
   of a community. The M value can be estimated as the number of
   significant axes obtained by ordination procedures. The percentage of
   total variance explained by these axes, T, is used as measure of
   structural rigidity. This approach is applied to data on the
   multi-scaled spatial distribution of marine benthic ciliates and
   macrofauna. Both the M and the T values obtained by principal component
   analysis show significant scale-dependence with an evident threshold at
   some critical area, with values of zero below this threshold, then
   increasing sharply as the area extends beyond the threshold. The
   critical scale of community organization ranges from hundreds of meters

Abstract = {{Northern boreal forest reserves that display no signs of modern forest
   exploitation are often regarded as pristine and are frequently used as
   ecological reference areas for conservation and restoration. However,
   the long-term effects of human utilization of such forests are rarely
   investigated. Therefore, using both paleoecological and archaeological
   methods, we analyzed temporal and spatial gradients of long-term human
   impact in a large old-growth forest reserve in the far north of Sweden,
   comparing vegetational changes during the last millennium at three sites
   with different land use histories. Large parts of the forest displayed
   no visible signs of past human land use, and in an area with no
   recognized history of human land use the vegetation composition appears
   to have been relatively stable throughout the studied period. However,
   at two locations effects of previous land use could be distinguished
   extending at least four centuries back in time. Long-term, but
   low-intensity, human land use, including cultivation, reindeer herding
   and tree cutting, has clearly generated an open forest structure with
   altered species composition in the field layer at settlement sites and
   in the surrounding forest. Our analysis shows that past human land use
   created a persistent legacy that is still visible in the present forest
   ecosystem. This study highlights the necessity for ecologists to
   incorporate a historical approach to discern underlying factors that
   have caused vegetational changes, including past human activity. It also
   indicates that the intensity and spatial distribution of human land use
   within the landscape matrices of any forests should be assessed before
   using them as ecological references. The nomenclature of vascular plants

Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Question: How does the ability to improve foraging skills by learning,
   and to transfer that learned knowledge, affect the development of
   intra-population foraging specializations?
   Features of the model: We use both a state-dependent life-history model
   implemented by stochastic dynamic programming (SDPM) and an
   individual-based model (IBM) to capture the dynamic nature of
   behavioural preferences in feeding. Variables in the SDPM include energy
   reserves, skill levels, energy and handling time per single prey item,
   metabolic rate, the rates at which skills are learned and forgotten, the
   effect of skills on handling time, and the relationship between energy
   reserves and fitness. Additional variables in the IBM include the
   probability of successful weaning, the logistic dynamics of the prey
   species with stochastic recruitment, the intensity of top-down control
   of prey by predators, the mean and variance in skill levels of new
   recruits, and the extent to which learned information can be transmitted
   via matrilineal social learning.
   Key range of variables: We explore the effects of approaching the time
   horizon in the SDPM, changing the extent to which skills can improve
   with experience, increasing the rates of learning or forgetting of
   skills, changing whether the learning curve is constant, accelerating
   ('J'-shaped) or decelerating ('r'-shaped), changing both mean and
   maximum possible energy reserves, changing metabolic costs of foraging,
   and changing the rate of encounter with prey.
   Conclusions: The model results show that the following factors increase
   the degree of prey specialization observed in a predator population: (1)
   Experience handling a prey type can substantially improve foraging
   skills for that prey. (2) There is limited ability to retain complex
   learned skills for multiple prey types. (3) The learning curve for
   acquiring new foraging skills is accelerating, or J-shaped. (4) The
   metabolic costs of foraging are high relative to available energy
   reserves. (5) Offspring can learn foraging skills from their mothers
   (matrilineal social learning). (6) Food abundance is limited, such that
   average individual energy reserves are low Additionally, the following
   factors increase the likelihood of alternative specializations
   co-occurring in a predator population: (1) The predator exerts effective
   top-down control of prey abundance, resulting in frequency-dependent
   dynamics. (2) There is stochastic variation in prey population dynamics,
   but this variation is neither too extreme in magnitude nor too `slow'
   with respect to the time required for an individual forager to learn new
   foraging skills. For a given predator population, we deduce that the
   degree of specialization will be highest for those prey types requifing
   complex capture or handling skills, while prey species that are both
   profitable and easy to capture and handle will be included in the diet
   of all individuals. Frequency-dependent benefits of selecting
   alternative prey types, combined with the ability of foragers to improve
   their foraging skills by learning, and transmit learned skills to
   offspring, can result in behaviourally mediated foraging specialization,
   and also lead to the co-existence of alternative specializations. The
   extent of such specialization is predicted to be a variable trait,
   increasing in locations or years when intra-specific competition is high
   relative to inter-specific competition.}},

Abstract = {{Like many arid and semiarid regions, the Great Basin of the western
   United States is undergoing major ecological, social, and economic
   changes that are having widespread detrimental effects on the structure,

   expansion of invasive species. Cumulative effects include vegetation
   type conversions, loss of watershed functioning, loss of native species,
   and diminished economic potential. The diversity and magnitude of issues
   require consensus on priority issues, and new and innovative research

Abstract = {{Most ecologists believe that climate change poses a significant threat
   to the persistence of native species. However, in some areas climate
   change may reduce or eliminate non-native invasive species, creating
   opportunities for restoration. If invasive species are no longer suited

   may not be viable either. If neither invasive nor native species are
   climatically viable, a type of ``transformative{''} restoration will be
   required, involving the translocation of novel species that can survive
   and reproduce under new climate conditions. Here, we illustrate one
   approach for restoration planning by using bioclimatic envelope modeling
   to identify restoration opportunities in the western United States,
   where the invasive plant cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is no longer
   climatically viable under 2100 conditions projected by the Geophysical
   Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL2.1) coupled atmosphere-ocean general

Abstract = {{Is complexity growth the result of a continuous process or a sudden
   breakthrough? An increased energy density rate is the effect or the
   cause of a complexity leap? Should we approach complexity change by the
   perspective of components behaviour or system's space geometry? In this
   work we address some of the questions regarding the theoretical approach
   to complexity change. For this purpose a case study drawn by the
   productive structure and the transport system is considered. We would
   like here to propose an example in which the system structure is
   reshaped in a more energy intensive fashion as to increase the
   components' interactions due to a symmetry rupture in the space. Flows
   throughout the system are thereby incremented in a discontinuous way by
   a complexity leap. In the case study, we analyze how the productive
   system evolved its structure, between 1970s and 1990s, to increase
   interactions among its parts and thus further develop the transport
   sub-system. A two-stage shift has been considered: the fordian and the
   post-fordian productive structure. The second structure, given the same
   amount of parts, has been shown to increase the degree of freedom (path
   length and path diversity) of the system. The underlying evolutionary
   pattern is then analyzed. This evolutionary pattern relies on the
   hypothesis that thermodynamic evolutionary systems are characterized by
   an ever growing influx of energy driven into the system by
   self-catalytic processes that must find their way through the
   constraints of the system. The system initially disposes of the energy
   by expanding, in extent and in the number of components, up to
   saturation due to inner or outer constraints. The two counteractive
   forces, constraints and growing energy flux, expose the system to new
   gradients. Every new (spatial) gradient upon the system represents a
   symmetry rupture in the components' space. By exploring a new gradient,
   the system imposes further restrictions on its components and increases
   its overall degree of freedom. The counteractive effects of
   reduction/increase of degree of freedom concern two different
   hierarchical levels and occur at two different space and time scales.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a theoretical model of withdrawing resources based
   on Odum's energy systems diagrams. According to the theory of a general
   pulsing principle, withdrawing resources changes in time shifting from
   the initial phases of growth and maturity to the phases of descent and
   low energy restoration. A simulation was performed in order to
   hypothesize potential future trends of withdrawing renewable and
   non-renewable resources and to show some aspects of their
   sustainability-unsustainability, respectively. According to Odum's
   theory, after the rapid growth of the last century, our civilization is
   living in a climax transition phase and it is now approaching a descent
   phase. A ``way down{''} will be necessary due to the exhaustion of
   non-renewable and to the limited use of renewable resources. An
   integrated ``renew-non-renew{''} model was developed by Odum to show how
   a ``business as usual{''} trend will bring us to a drastic transition to
   a world that uses scarce renewable resources. Nevertheless, a different
   choice is possible, based on Daly's concept of quasi-sustainability that
   can inspire a new model. The latter argued that the exploitation of a
   non-renewable resource must be paired with a compensating investment in
   a renewable substitute. Our model shows that we can use non-renewable
   resources better to considerably improve our capacity of capturing
   renewable resources in the future. We present this as a necessary
   condition to address a sustainable environmental policy. (C) 2009

   province from 2001 to 2006. The triple rice-cropped areas in Soc Trang
   province also expanded concentrically from 2001 to 2003, but some of
   these new triple rice-cropped areas returned to double rice cropping
   after 2004. interviews with farmers and ancillary hydrological
   monitoring data suggested that changes in the water environment and
   transmission of information about new farming systems are closely
   connected with the annual expansion of triple rice-cropped areas in both
   provinces. The availability of salt-free irrigation water in the dry
   season may have led some pioneering farmers to attempt full-scale
   dry-season cropping. Furthermore, successful dry-season harvests and
   recent increases in the price of rice might have encouraged neighboring
   farmers to follow suit. Based on MODIS time-series imagery with field
   interviews at land-use change hotspots, the spatial structure of coastal
   farming systems and their recent changes were revealed from a
   macroscopic view point. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although long-lived tree species experience considerable environmental
   variation over their life spans, their geographical distributions
   reflect sensitivity mainly to mean monthly climatic conditions. We
   introduce an approach that incorporates a physiologically based growth
   model to illustrate how a half-dozen tree species differ in their
   responses to monthly variation in four climatic-related variables: water
   availability, deviations from an optimum temperature, atmospheric
   humidity deficits, and the frequency frost. Rather than use climatic
   data directly to correlate with a species' distribution, we assess the
   relative constraints of each of the four variables as they affect
   predicted monthly photosynthesis for Douglas-fir, the most widely
   distributed species in the region. We apply an automated regression-tree
   analysis to create a suite of rules, which differentially rank the
   relative importance of the four climatic modifiers for each species, and
   provide a basis for predicting a species' presence or absence on 3737
   distributed U.S. Forest Services' Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)
   field survey plots. Results of this generalized rule-based approach were
   encouraging, with weighted accuracy, which combines the prediction of
   both presence and absence on FIA survey plots, averaging 87\%. A wider
   sampling of climatic conditions throughout the full range of a species'

Abstract = {{Like other regions of the northern hemisphere, the northeastern United
   States has experienced a general increase in regional temperatures over
   the past 20 years. Quantifying the ecological implications of these
   changing temperatures has been severely constrained by a lack of
   multispecies distributional data by which to compare long-term changes.
   We used the New York State Breeding Bird Atlas, a statewide survey of
   5332 25 km(2) blocks surveyed in 1980-1985 and 2000-2005, to test
   several predictions that the birds of New York State are responding to
   climate change. Our objective was to use an information-theoretic
   approach to analyze changes in three geographic range characteristics,
   the center of occurrence, range boundaries, and states of occurrence to
   address several predictions that the birds of New York State are moving
   polewards and up in elevation. As expected, we found all bird species
   (n=129) included in this analysis showed an average northward range
   shift in their mean latitude of 3.58 km {[}Prob(H(a vertical
   bar)data)=0.87)]. Past studies have found that northern range boundaries
   are more likely to be influenced by climatic factors than southern range
   boundaries. Consequently, we predicted that northward shifts would be
   more evident in northern as opposed to southern range boundaries. We
   found, however, that the southern range boundaries of northerly birds
   moved northward by 11.4 km {[}n=43, Prob(H(a vertical bar)data)=0.92],
   but this pattern was less evident in northern range boundaries of
   southerly birds. In addition, we found that bird species demonstrated a
   general shift downhill in their mean elevation, but demonstrated little
   change in their elevational boundaries. The repeated pattern of a
   predicted northward shift in bird ranges in various geographic regions
   of the world provides compelling evidence that climate change is driving
   range shifts.}},

Abstract = {{The famous Polynesian voyages characterized an intensive network of
   cultural exchange and colonization that was particularly active from ad
   1000 to 1450. But, why would large groups of people leave their
   homelands to voyage into the unknown? Oceanic voyages are risky, albeit
   less so today than in the past. Landfalls were not guaranteed
   improvements over ports of departure. Taking the Cook Islands as an
   example, we ask whether harmful algal blooms that result in ciguatera
   fish poisoning in humans prompted past and present emigration pulses of
   peoples from within Polynesia. We take a multipronged approach to
   examine our hypothesis, involving: (1) archaeological evidence, (2)
   ciguatera fish poisoning reports since the 1940s, and (3) climate and
   temperature oscillations using palaeodatasets. The archaeological
   records of fish bones and hooks show abrupt changes in fishing practices
   in post-ad 1450 records. Sudden dietary shifts are not linked to
   overfishing, but may be a sign of ciguatera fish poisoning and
   adjustment of fishing preference. While fishes form the staple diet of
   Polynesians, such poisoning renders fishes unusable. We show that
   ciguatera fish poisoning events coincide with Pacific Decadal
   Oscillations and suggest that the celebrated Polynesian voyages across
   the Pacific Ocean may not have been random episodes of discovery to
   colonize new lands, but rather voyages of necessity. A modern analogue
   (in the 1990s) was the shift towards processed foods in the Cook Islands
   during ciguatera fish poisoning events, and mass emigration of islanders
   to New Zealand and Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Questions
   The relationship between fire, aridity and seed banks is poorly
   understood in plant community ecology. We tested whether there was a
   close correspondence between the seed bank and standing vegetation
   composition with time-since-fire in a desert. We also examined whether
   longer-lived species showed seed limitation relative to more ephemeral
   species, as this could influence grass-woody ratios in a major biome.
   Location
   Dune hummock grasslands/shrublands of central Australia.
   Methods
   The effects of time-since-fire on floristic and functional group
   composition were examined by comparing plots unburned since 1984 against
   plots that had been burned in 2002. Three methods were used to quantify
   seed abundances: a germination trial using heat and smoke application, a
   flotation method, and a sieving method.
   Results
   Seed bank densities were very low (< 3000 m(-2)). Species similarity
   between the seed bank and standing vegetation was high at sites recently
   burned (0.86) and low in sites long-since burned (0.52). The relative
   abundance of ephemeral species in the seed bank peaked in recently
   burned plots, but the relative abundance of seeds of woody species did
   not match the pattern of abundance in the standing vegetation.
   Remarkably, the dominant perennial grasses and woody species were either
   absent from the seed bank or present at extremely low abundances.
   Discussion
   Differences in the relative abundance of ephemeral species between
   standing vegetation and seed bank relate to the post-fire succession
   process. The small soil pool of seed from woody species may be explained
   by allocation to belowground carbohydrate storage over seed production.
   Field observations suggest, however, that production of strongly dormant
   seed can be prolific and that high levels of seed predation make this
   system strongly seed-limited. The discovery of this seed bank syndrome
   indicates that shifts in grass-woody ratios can be driven by the
   juxtaposition of unpredictable seed rain and fire events in these desert
   dunes. However, estimates of grass-woody ratios due to changing fire
   regimes will be difficult to predict.}},

Abstract = {{Questions
   What are the feedbacks among the seed bank, parent vegetation, and
   landscape structure that control plant species turnover in space and
   time in a tidal freshwater marsh? How can these feedbacks be used to
   better understand marsh community dynamics and to establish restoration
   practices that seek to restore vegetation diversity of this important
   and widely distributed ecosystem?
   Location
   Potomac River, Virginia, United States (15 km south of Washington, DC).
   Methods
   We sampled the seed bank and standing vegetation in a tidal freshwater
   marsh and explored similarities between seed bank and vegetation
   composition through space and time. We then investigated marsh surface
   elevation, distance to nearest tidal channels, and life history of
   component species as potential explanations for the observed vegetation
   patterns.
   Results
   The composition of individual plots changed considerably from year to
   year; however, the composition at broader spatial (whole marsh) and
   temporal (4 years) scales was relatively stable. Species composition of
   the seed bank was dissimilar to both the previous and current year's
   standing vegetation, and similarity to standing vegetation was
   particularly low in plots dominated by annual species. Landscape
   structure and life history characteristics of individual species best
   explained the spatiotemporal variability in marsh vegetation.
   Conclusions
   Restoration designs should be landscape-dependent and explicitly
   incorporate spatially structured elements such as elevation gradients to
   maximize community diversity in reconstructed tidal freshwater marshes.
   Optimal designs include areas of high seed input, areas of high species
   turnover, as well as other areas of greater stability.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of the spatial as well as the temporal structure of

   recreation (i.e. the landscape turnover rate), the minimum amount of
   potential habitat, its spatial configuration as well as the
   environmental conditions determining habitat quality are crucial factors
   for species occurrence. We analysed species responses to environmental
   parameters and to the spatio-temporal configuration of urban brownfield
   habitats in a multi-species approach (37 plant and 43 insect species).
   Species presence/absence data and soil parameters, site age, vegetation
   structure and landscape context were recorded by random stratified
   sampling at 133 study plots in industrial areas in the city of Bremen
   (Germany). Based on the field data, we predicted species occurrences by
   species distribution models using a multi-model inference approach.
   Predicted species communities were driven by successional age both at
   the scale of a single building lot and at the landscape scale. Minimum
   average succession time of brownfield habitats required to support all
   and especially regionally rare species depended on the proportion of
   available open space; the larger the potential habitat area the faster
   the acceptable turnover. Most plant, grasshopper, and leafhopper species
   modelled could be maintained at an intermediate turnover rate (mean age
   of 10-15 years) and a proportion of open sites of at least 40\%. Our
   modelling approach provides the opportunity of inferring optimal
   spatio-temporal landscape configurations for urban conservation
   management from patch scale species-environment relationships. The

Abstract = {{Small changes in environmental conditions can unexpectedly tip an
   ecosystem from one community type to another, and these often

   freshwater lakes and ponds, coral reefs, and kelp forests. A commonly
   accepted explanation is that these ecosystems contain multiple stable

   proven elusive. Here we present a novel approach and show that mussel
   beds and rockweed stands are multiple stable states on intertidal shores
   in the Gulf of Maine, USA. Using broad-scale observational data and
   long-term data from experimental clearings, we show that the removal of
   rockweed by winter ice scour can tip persistent rockweed stands to
   mussel beds. The observational data were analyzed with Anderson's
   discriminant analysis of principal coordinates, which provided an
   objective function to separate mussel beds from rockweed stands. The
   function was then applied to 55 experimental plots, which had been
   established in rockweed stands in 1996. Based on 2005 data, all
   uncleared controls and all but one of the small clearings were
   classified as rockweed stands; 37\% of the large clearings were
   classified as mussel beds. Our results address the establishment of
   mussels versus rockweeds and complement rather than refute the current
   paradigm that mussel beds and rockweed stands, once established, are
   maintained by site-specific differences in strong consumer control.}},

Abstract = {{The pace and magnitude of biodiversity loss has led to wide recognition
   that efforts to conserve individual species must be complemented by
   assessment and planning at community and ecosystem levels. Emerging
   protocols for assessing the conservation status of communities include
   as central criteria the current extent, historical reduction and
   contemporary rate of decline in geographic distribution. Estimation of
   these parameters is confronted by methodological challenges, data
   limitations and uncertainties that may vary from case to case. We
   describe an approach to these issues comprising five steps: (1)
   classification of the community using an analysis of data from
   systematic ground surveys; (2) mapping to produce a contemporary
   baseline distribution (1980s); (3) interpolation to produce a historical
   distribution (pre-European settlement); (4) interpretation of satellite
   imagery to update the distribution (various dates up to 2004) and (5)
   assessment of change in extent over historical and contemporary time
   scales incorporating plausible bounds of uncertainty around best
   estimates. The bounds can be based on areas for which image
   interpretation produces uncertain diagnosis of clearing and differences
   between credible alternative base maps of the same area. We demonstrated
   the approach using a case study of Coolibah-Black Box Woodland, a
   declining semi-arid woodland community in Australia and found that 61\%
   (plausible range 50-67\%) of the woodland community had been cleared
   since European settlement and that during 1998-2004 the community
   continued to decline on average by 135.3(+/- 21.7) km(2) each year, or
   1.7(+/- 0.3)\% of each previous year's distribution, apparently
   accelerating in recent years. Strengths of the approach include the use
   of biological data (cf. remote sensing) to distinguish the target
   assemblage from others, the use of historical and contemporary base
   lines to examine change over different time scales, and the use of
   bounded estimates to incorporate uncertainty into the assessment. Crown

Abstract = {{Aim To evaluate a suite of species distribution models for their utility

   Location The Rattlesnake Creek Terrane (RCT) of the Shasta-Trinity
   National Forest in the northern California Coast Range of the United

   Methods We used occurrence records from 25 years of US Forest Service
   botanical surveys, environmental and remotely sensed climate data to
   model the distributions of the target species across the RCT. The models
   included generalized linear models (GLM), artificial neural networks
   (ANN), random forests (RF) and maximum entropy (ME). From the results we
   generated predictive maps that were used to identify areas of high
   probability occurrence. We made field visits to the top-ranked sites to
   search for new populations of the target species.
   Results Random forests gave the best results according to area under the
   curve and Kappa statistics, although ME was in close agreement. While
   GLM and ANN also gave good results, they were less restrictive and more
   varied than RF and ME. Cross-model correlations were the highest for
   species with the most records and declined with record numbers. Model
   assessment using a separate dataset confirmed that RF provided the best
   predictions of appropriate habitat. Use of RF output to prioritize
   search areas resulted in the discovery of 16 new populations of the

   Main conclusions Species distribution models, such as RF and ME, which
   use presence data and information about the background matrix where

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal variation in primary productivity is known to have strong
   and far-reaching effects on herbivore ecology, but this relationship is
   often studied indirectly at broad scales, in part due to the difficulty
   in measuring selection for green biomass by individual animals. In
   aquatic systems, the concentration of chlorophyll in herbivore feces has
   been used as a direct measure of the consumption of photosynthetic
   primary production, but this method has not been applied to terrestrial
   systems. We measured chlorophyll concentration in feces from elk (Cervus
   elaphus) experiencing large fluctuations in primary production in the
   winter to spring transition over three years. We compared temporal
   trends in fecal chlorophyll with trends in fecal nitrogen, grass
   chlorophyll, grass digestible nitrogen, and landscape-level primary
   productivity (as described by the normalized difference vegetation index
   or NDVI). We also directly examined the relationship between fecal
   chlorophyll and NDVI. Temporal trends in fecal chlorophyll were strong
   and well described by piecewise regression (adjusted coefficient of
   determination, r(a)(2) = 0.881-0.888), showing uniformly low
   concentrations throughout winter followed by an abrupt, rapid increase
   beginning on different Julian days (88, 91, or 110) each year. Changes
   in fecal chlorophyll closely matched the temporal trend in the
   chlorophyll and digestible nitrogen concentration of forage grasses
   collected directly from elk feeding sites. Fecal chlorophyll also
   tracked broad temporal patterns in fecal nitrogen and NDVI, but
   discrepancies between the indexes may highlight preferences or
   constraints on selectivity for green biomass in elk. Spatially and
   temporally matched NDVI and fecal chlorophyll estimates were
   uncorrelated until NDVI reached approximately half its seasonal range.
   Combined, these data describe important patterns in selection for
   nutritious, green biomass in a temperate herbivore that would be
   difficult to study without data on fecal chlorophyll. Fecal chlorophyll
   produced novel and precise descriptions of (and detected large
   interannual differences in) winter length, severity, and the rate of
   spring green-up, as they were experienced by a large, grazing herbivore.
   Measuring fecal chlorophyll provides a noninvasive, inexpensive, and
   direct approach to describe an important aspect of foraging ecology in
   terrestrial herbivores and may be particularly powerful for studying
   climate effects in seasonal environments.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main functions of exploratory behaviour is to gain
   information about the environment. The adaptive value of such behaviour
   should vary with ecological conditions influencing the diversity and
   stability of resources, as well as with the costs associated with
   gathering information. Consequently, predictions can be made about
   environmental factors influencing the evolution of exploration. We used
   comparative methods, combining a field experiment with literature data,
   to study correlated evolution between explorative behaviour and ecology
   among 13 species of Darwin's finches. Controlling for phylogenetic
   influences, we found that exploration (measured as the proportion of
   individuals responding in the experiment) increased with diet diversity
   and the amount of fruit in diet, consistent with theories stating that
   exploration aimed at finding new food types should be more beneficial
   for generalists than for specialists. However, our study is the first to
   demonstrate a correlation between neophilia and food diversity. Contrary
   to our prediction, species with a high percentage of concealed food in
   their diet were less explorative. A possible explanation for this novel
   finding is that in our study system concealed food may be a stable
   resource, and species using such resources should be less dependent on
   the discovery of new food types.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation to a sudden extreme change in environment, beyond the usual

   linear functions of the environment. Reaction norm elevation and slope
   (plasticity) vary among genotypes. Initially, in the average background
   environment, the character is canalized with minimum genetic and
   phenotypic variance, and no correlation between reaction norm elevation
   and slope. The optimal plasticity is proportional to the predictability
   of environmental fluctuations over time lag tau. During the first
   generation in the new environment the mean fitness suddenly drops and
   the mean phenotype jumps towards the new optimum phenotype by
   plasticity. Subsequent adaptation occurs in two phases. Rapid evolution
   of increased plasticity allows the mean phenotype to closely approach

Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{961-971}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Although the contribution of community members to functional diversity
   is a key question of conservation ecology, its measurement and
   interpretation are rather problematic. In this paper, we suggest a novel
   method for decomposing functional diversity. To do this we consider
   functional units (i.e. species or a group of species with identical
   traits) as the functional building blocks of communities. Then we
   propose the use of a recently developed measure of functional diversity
   (called modified functional attribute diversity or MFAD) and suggest
   additive decomposition of MFAD into functional values contributed by the
   functional units. We point out that functional values are related to
   changes in MFAD if the functional unit is removed from the community.
   This property of decomposition allows the quantification of the
   contribution of community members to functional diversity. By studying
   artificial and actual communities we compare the performance of our new
   method with other recently developed contribution measures, which are
   based on dendrograms and ordinations. Both theoretical considerations
   and analyses of artificial and actual data sets suggest that the
   proposed method of calculating functional values expresses more
   explicitly the contribution of community members to functional diversity
   and hereby can be used as a simple, yet efficient method for searching

   the contribution of community members to functional diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Fastloc GPS (FGPS) is a variant of Global Positioning System (GPS)
   technology that offers important new utility for investigating
   fine-scale movements of marine animals like green turtles that surface
   too briefly for effective use of standard GPS. I report here on the
   accuracy and efficiency of this novel technology, compare it with two
   alternative methods, namely boat-based ultrasonic tracking and Argos
   Platform Transmitter Terminals (PTTs), and provide new data on the
   vagility and habitat selection of green turtles in shallow coastal
   foraging habitat. I used a combined FGPS receiver and P-IT transmitter
   (Sirtrack, Havelock North, New Zealand) mounted together with an
   ultrasonic transmitter and time-depth recorder in a tether-attached
   housing that allowed automatic detachment and subsequent retrieval of
   the equipment without the requirement to recapture turtles. With this
   equipment I conducted short deployments (4.5 to 16.8 d) on 3 free-living
   adult-size green turtles in coastal foraging habitat in Queensland,
   Australia. In addition, stationary tests in air and afloat were
   conducted at the same site. FGPS location error (mean +/- SD) increased
   as the number of satellites used in each computation decreased, from 26
   m +/- 19.2 (8 satellites) to 172 m +/- 317.5 (4 satellites). During live
   tracking the frequency of FGPS locations greatly exceeded Argos PTT,
   such that screened data comprised about 50 times more FGPS locations
   despite a much tighter screening threshold for FGPS (250 m) than for
   Argos PTT (1000 m). FGPS locations showed the three study turtles used
   modest short-term activity ranges with Minimum Convex Polygon area mean
   +/- SD 662 ha +/- 293.9. They all remained within <4.7 km of their
   capture-release locations and favoured shallow water, with 86\% of
   locations at charted depths <= 3 m and the deepest location at 5.9 m.
   Fine-scale movements of each turtle varied from day to day with respect
   to tortuosity and areas traversed. Statistically significant day-night
   differences were evident in average rates of movement (greater by day)
   and in habitat selection, where diurnal locations had greater seagrass
   density while nocturnal locations featured deeper bathymetry. Individual
   turtles revisited some of their centres of activity (identified from
   50\% fixed kernel utilisation distributions) on multiple occasions but
   none of the study turtles travelled consistently between the same
   day-night pair of sites as has been reported elsewhere. Such disparity
   and the day-to-day variation in movements revealed by these short-term
   findings highlight the need for detailed tracking over longer periods at
   multiple locations. Fastloc GPS technology proved an effective new tool
   for this area of research. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of the structure and function of urban metabolic systems is an

   utility analysis to analyze the basic network structure of the urban
   metabolic system and the complex ecological relationships within the
   system, providing a new way to perform such research. Using four Chinese
   cities as examples, we developed an ecological network model of the
   urban metabolic system. By using network pathway analysis, we studied
   the changing relationships between metabolic length and the number of
   metabolic pathways, and between metabolic length and reachability. Based
   on the distribution of the number of metabolic pathways, we describe the
   basic structure and intercompartment relationships of the system. By
   using the sign distribution in the network utility matrix, we determined
   the ecological relationships and degree of mutualism between the
   compartments of the system. The basic components of the system consisted
   of the internal environment, the external environment, and the
   agricultural, industrial, and domestic sectors. With increasing
   metabolic length, the ecological relationships among the components of
   the system became more diverse, and the numbers of metabolic paths and
   their reachability improved. Although the basic network structure of the
   four cities was identical, the mutualism index differed. Beijing's
   mutualism index was superior to that of Shanghai, and much higher than
   those of Tianjin and Chongqing. By analyzing the structure and function
   of the urban metabolic system, we provide suggestions for optimizing the
   structure and adjusting the relationships, and propose methods for the

Abstract = {{Birds in which both sexes produce complex songs are thought to be more
   common in the tropics than in temperate areas, where typically only

   the New World blackbirds (Icteridae), a family with both temperate and
   tropical representatives. We provide strong evidence that members of
   this group have moved repeatedly from tropical to temperate breeding
   ranges and, furthermore, that these range shifts were associated with
   losses of female song more often than expected by chance. This
   historical perspective suggests that male-biased song production in many
   temperate species is the result not of sexual selection for complex song
   in males but of selection against such songs in females. Our results
   provide new insights into the differences we see today between tropical

Abstract = {{The C-13/C-12 ratio in pedogenic carbonate (i.e., CaCO3 formed in soil)
   is a significant tool for investigating C-4 biomes of the past. However,
   the paleoecological meaning of delta C-13 values in pedogenic carbonate
   can change with the scale at which one considers the data. We describe
   studies of modern soils, fossil soils, and vegetation change in the
   Chihuahuan Desert of North America and elsewhere that reveal four scales
   important for paleoecologic interpretations. (1) At the broadest scale,
   the biome scale ( hundreds to millions of km(2)), an isotopic record
   interpreted as C-3 vegetation replacing C-4 grasslands may indicate
   invading C-3 woody shrubs instead of expanding C-3 forests (a common
   interpretation). ( 2) At the landscape scale (several tens of m(2) to
   hundreds of km(2)), the accuracy of scaling up paleoclimatic
   interpretations to a regional level is affected by the landform
   containing the isotopic record. (3) At the soil-profile scale (cm(2) to
   m(2)), soil profiles with multiple generations of carbonate mixed
   together have a lower-resolution paleoecologic record than soil profiles
   repeatedly buried. (4) At the rhizosphere scale (mu m(2) to cm(2)),
   carbonate formed on roots lack the 14-17 parts per thousand enrichment
   observed at broader scales, revealing different fractionation processes
   at different scales. A multi-scale approach in dealing with delta C-13

   interpretations and understanding of soil-geomorphic-climatic

Abstract = {{Lagoons are highly productive coastal features that provide a range of
   natural services that society values. Their setting within the coastal
   landscape leaves them especially vulnerable to profound physical,
   ecological, and associated societal disturbance from global climate
   change. Expected shifts in physical and ecological characteristics range
   from changes in flushing regime, freshwater inputs, and water chemistry
   to complete inundation and loss and the concomitant loss of natural and
   human communities. Therefore, managing coastal lagoons in the context of
   global climate change is critical. Although management approaches will
   vary depending on local conditions and cultural norms, all management
   scenarios will need to be nimble and to make full use of the spectrum of
   values through which society views these unique ecosystems. We propose
   that this spectrum includes pragmatic, scholarly, aesthetic, and tacit
   categories of value. Pragmatic values such as fishery or tourism revenue
   are most easily quantified and are therefore more likely to be
   considered in management strategies. In contrast, tacit values such as a
   sense of place are more difficult to quantify and therefore more likely
   to be left out of explicit management justifications. However, tacit
   values are the most influential to stakeholder involvement because they
   both derive from and shape individual experiences and beliefs. Tacit
   values underpin all categories of social values that we describe and can
   be expected to have a strong influence over human behavior. The
   articulation and inclusion of the full spectrum of values, especially
   tacit values, will facilitate and support nimble adaptive management of
   coastal lagoon ecosystems in the context of global climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Paying landowners to conserve forests is a promising new strategy to
   protect biodiversity and ecosystem services. However to succeed with
   this approach, programme managers need reliable monitoring data to make
   informed payment decisions. This includes withholding payment from
   landowners who do not meet conservation objectives. The monitoring
   method used for the Monarch Butterfly Conservation Fund compared aerial
   photographs and conducted field sampling to identify forest changes. The
   comparison of aerial photographs showed that 161 hectares of forest were
   degraded in the central core zone of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere
   Reserve in Mexico between 2001 and 2003. As a result, payment was
   withheld from one of 13 landowners. Analysis of high resolution (0.6 m)
   digital aerial photographs did not detect finer scale changes, despite
   obtaining an average pixel resolution 1000 times greater than Landsat
   satellite imagery. This suggests that current payment for ecosystem
   services programmes are underestimating environmental change and
   overpaying non-compliant participants. In addition, selecting a decision
   rule to enforce payment conditionality raised new questions about how
   much ecosystem degradation should be permitted before withholding
   payment. Sound decisions about withholding payment cannot be developed
   until the marginal value of ecosystem services is better understood.

Abstract = {{In the era of post-genomic research two new disciplines, Systems and

   Synthetic biology on the other hand uses mathematical models to design
   novel biological `circuits' (synthetic networks) able to perform
   specific tasks (for example, periodic expression of a gene of interest),
   or able to change the behavior of a biological process in a desired way

Abstract = {{Macroalgae are a major benthic component of coral reefs and their
   dynamics influence the resilience of coral reefs to disturbance.
   However, the relative importance of physical and ecological processes in
   driving macroalgal dynamics is poorly understood. Here we develop a
   Bayesian belief network (BBN) model to integrate many of these processes
   and predict the growth of coral reef macroalgae. Bayesian belief
   networks use probabilistic relationships rather than deterministic rules
   to quantify the cause and effect assumptions. The model was developed
   using both new empirical data and quantified relationships elicited from
   previous studies. We demonstrate the efficacy of the BBN to predict the
   dynamics of a common Caribbean macroalgal genus Dictyota. Predictions of
   the model have an average accuracy of 55\% (implying that 55\% of the
   predicted categories of Dictyota cover were assigned to the correct
   class). Sensitivity analysis suggested that macroalgal dynamics were
   primarily driven by top-down processes of grazing rather than bottom-up
   nutrification. BBNs provide a useful framework for modelling complex
   systems, identifying gaps in our scientific understanding and
   communicating the complexities of the associated uncertainties in an
   explicit manner to stakeholders. We anticipate that accuracies will
   improve as new data are added to the model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

   management decision making. In addition, the use of broad-spectrum
   insecticides can damage the populations of natural enemies, reducing the
   cost-effectiveness of insecticide investment if unaccounted for in
   treatment decisions.
   The existing literature on modeling of biological control of insect
   pests has generally focused on simulations of the population dynamics of
   pest and natural enemy species and the processes underlying pest
   control. But agriculture is a managed ecosystem where predator-prey
   relationships are heavily influenced by human managers. In modeling
   managerial choices, this study develops an intra-seasonal dynamic
   bioeconomic optimization model for insecticide-based pest management
   that explicitly takes into account both the biological control effect of
   natural enemies on pest density and the nontarget mortality effect of
   insecticides on the level of natural pest control supplied. The model
   captures predator-prey interactions, linking them to crop growth and
   yield damage functions, which in turn are evaluated in a dynamic
   optimization framework. We introduce a new decision rule for judicious
   insecticide decisions using a natural enemy-adjusted economic threshold.
   This threshold represents the pest population density at which
   insecticide control becomes optimal in spite of the opportunity cost of
   injury to natural enemies of the target pest. Using field data from
   Michigan, the model is applied to the case of soybean aphid (Aphis
   glycines, Matsumura), a recent invasive pest of soybean (Glycine max),
   whose management is of both economic and environmental importance to the
   North Central region of the United States. As illustrated by the
   numerical examples, such natural enemy-adjusted threshold is likely to
   lead to fewer recommendations for insecticide use than naive models that
   ignore natural enemies, resulting in less insecticide use, while
   maintaining profitability for farmers that rely on chemical pest control
   methods.
   The bioeconomic model developed in this study can be used to conduct a
   wide variety of analyses such as identifying dynamically optimal spray
   strategies and estimating the implied economic value of natural control
   services. Furthermore, with the incorporation of inter-year carry-over
   factors, such as overwintering of pests and natural enemies, the current
   model can contribute to building multi-year models for studying
   long-term pest management. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   designed a housing experiment with 12 adult rabbits and criticised the

   smaller than 6 mm in similar proportions. In response to their criticism
   we argue the following. The selection of a 6 mm threshold has a
   bibliographic basis, it is not a new method developed by Rueda et al.
   and produces consistent results When applied in the field. Assuming that
   Delibes-Mateos et al. results are accurate, we should have found a

   which is not the case. We believe that the use of commercial pelleted
   food, keeping animals isolated in small cages for over a year. and the
   use of adult rabbits only, makes the experimental design used by these
   authors not Suitable to refute the usefulness of separating rabbit
   pellets smaller and larger than 6 mm diameter as indicators of changes
   in the relative abundance of juvenile and adult rabbits in the field.

Abstract = {{The New River Wetlands Project is comprised of two constructed treatment
   wetland sites supplied with water from the New River and agricultural
   drainage water from the Imperial Valley in California. Bioaccumulation
   of selenium has created toxic conditions for wildlife in similar
   wetlands in other areas. Selenium levels in water (at wetland inflow and
   outflow), sediments, plants, invertebrates, and fish were analyzed for
   both wetland sites from 2006 to 2007. An average of 56\% of the total
   mass of selenium in the inflow was removed at the Imperial site, and
   70\% was removed at the Brawley site. Most of the retained selenium (8
   kg at the Imperial site and 2 kg at the Brawley site) was in the
   sediments. Less than 1\% of the selenium accumulated in plant tissues.
   Mass balance calculations estimated that 17-61\% of the selenium was
   lost through volatilization. After 6 years of operation of these
   wetlands, concentrations of selenium in fish and invertebrates were at
   or above threshold ranges for reproductive effects in birds and fish.
   Constructed wetlands are an efficient method for removing selenium from

Abstract = {{A goal of animal movement analysis is to reveal behavioural mechanisms
   by which organisms utilize complex and variable environments.
   Statistical analysis of movement data is complicated by the fact that
   the data are multidimensional, autocorrelated and often marked by error

   data reflect behaviours that are themselves heterogeneous. Here, we
   model movement data as a subsampling of a continuous stochastic
   processes, and introduce the behavioural change point analysis (BCPA), a
   likelihood-based method that allows for the identification of
   significant structural changes. The BCPA is robust to gappiness and
   measurement error, computationally efficient, easy to implement and
   reveals structure that is otherwise difficult to discern. We apply the
   analysis to a GPS movement track of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus
   ursinus), revealing an unexpectedly complex diurnal behavioural profile,
   and demonstrate its robustness to the greater errors associated with the
   ARGOS tracking system. By informing empirical interpretation of movement

Abstract = {{Pollination network studies are based on pollinator surveys conducted on
   focal plants. This plant-centred approach provides insufficient
   information on flower visitation habits of rare pollinator species,
   which are the majority in pollinator communities. As a result,
   pollination networks contain very high proportions of pollinator species
   linked to a single plant species (extreme specialists), a pattern that
   contrasts with the widely accepted view that plant-pollinator
   interactions are mostly generalized. In this study of a Mediterranean
   scrubland community in NE Spain we supplement data from an intensive
   field survey with the analysis of pollen loads carried by pollinators.
   We observed 4265 contacts corresponding to 19 plant and 122 pollinator
   species. The addition of pollen data unveiled a very significant number
   of interactions, resulting in important network structural changes.
   Connectance increased 1.43-fold, mean plant connectivity went from 18.5
   to 26.4, and mean pollinator connectivity from 2.9 to 4.1. Extreme
   specialist pollinator species decreased 0.6-fold, suggesting that
   ecological specialization is often overestimated in plant-pollinator
   networks. We expected a greater connectivity increase in rare species,
   and consequently a decrease in the level of asymmetric specialization.
   However, new links preferentially attached to already highly connected
   nodes and, as a result, both nestedness and centralization increased.
   The addition of pollen data revealed the existence of four clearly
   defined modules that were not apparent when only field survey data were
   used. Three of these modules had a strong phenological component. In
   comparison to other pollination webs, our network had a high proportion
   of connector links and species. That is, although significant, the four

Abstract = {{Aim: To model and characterize evolutionary games where individuals have
   states that are described by controlled Markov chains. The action of an
   individual in a local interaction with another randomly selected
   individual determines not only the instantaneous fitness but also its
   probability to move to another state. The goal of a player is to
   maximize its time average fitness.
   Mathematical methods: The main mathematical tool is occupation measures
   (expected frequencies of states and actions). This tool is a central one
   in the theory of Markov decision processes. We make use of the geometric
   properties of the set of achievable occupation measures.
   Key assumption: Under any pure stationary policy of an individual, its
   Markov chain has a single ergodic class of states.
   Results: We define and characterize a new concept of evolutionarily
   stable strategies based on the concept of `occupation measures'. We
   relate this set to the concept of evolutionarily stable set (ESSet). We
   present a way to transform the new type of evolutionary games into
   standard ones. Applying this novel framework to energy control in

Abstract = {{Shark fisheries worldwide are mostly unmanaged, but the burgeoning shark
   fin industry in the last few decades has made monitoring catch and trade
   of these animals critical. As a tool for molecular species
   identification, DNA barcoding offers significant potential. However, the
   genetic distance-based approach towards species identification employed
   by the Barcode of Life Data Systems may oftentimes lack the specificity
   needed for regulatory or legal applications that require unambiguous
   identification results. This is because such specificity is not
   typically realized by anything less than a 100\% match of the query
   sequence to an entry in the reference database using genetic distance.
   Although various divergence thresholds have been proposed to define
   acceptable levels of intraspecific variation, enough exceptions exist to
   cast reasonable doubt on many less than exact matches using a
   distance-based approach for the identification of unknowns. An
   alternative approach relies on the identification of discrete molecular
   characters that can be used to unambiguously diagnose species. The
   objective of this study was to assess the performance differences
   between these competing approaches by examining more than 1000 DNA
   barcodes representing nearly 20\% of all known elasmobranch species. Our
   results demonstrate that a character-based, nucleotide diagnostic (ND)
   approach to barcode identification is feasible and also provides novel
   insights into the structure of haplotype diversity among closely related

Abstract = {{Accurate genotyping of complex systems, such as the major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) often requires simultaneous analysis of
   multiple co-amplifying loci. Here we explore the utility of the
   massively parallel 454 sequencing method as a universal tool for
   genotyping complex MHC systems in nonmodel vertebrates. The power of
   this approach stems from the use of tagged polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) primers to identify individual amplicons which can be
   simultaneously sequenced to the arbitrarily chosen coverage. However,
   the error-prone sequencing technology poses considerable challenges as
   it may be difficult to discriminate between sequencing errors and true
   rare alleles; due to complex nature of artefacts and errors, efficient
   quality control is required. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates the
   parallel 454 sequencing can be an efficient genotyping platform for MHC
   and provides an alternative to classical genotyping methods. We
   introduced procedures to identify the threshold that can be used to
   reduce number of genotyping errors by eliminating most of artefactual
   alleles (AA) representing PCR or sequencing errors. Our procedures are
   based on two expectations: first, that AA should be relatively rare,
   both overall and on per-individual basis, and second, that most AA
   result from errors introduced to sequences of true alleles. In our data
   set, alleles with an average per-individual frequency below 3\% most
   likely represented artefacts. This threshold will vary in other
   applications according to the complexity of the genotyped system. We
   strongly suggest direct assessment of genotyping error in every
   experiment by running a fraction of duplicates: individuals amplified in
   independent PCRs.}},

Abstract = {{Green Public Procurement (GPP) has been considered as an important

   rates. Recently, a new method was developed, analyzing the existence of
   environmental criteria in the calls for tenders. However, the studies
   have dealt neither with the progress in GPP, nor the statistical
   evidence of differences between countries. Our aim was to analyze more
   thoroughly whether the differences in the proportions of `green' calls
   for tenders between the three Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland and

Abstract = {{The ability of populations to be connected across large landscapes via
   dispersal is critical to long-term viability for many species. One means
   to mitigate population isolation is the protection of movement corridors
   among habitat patches. Nevertheless, the utility of small, narrow,
   linear features as habitat corridors has been hotly debated. Here, we
   argue that analysis of movement across continuously resistant landscapes
   allows a shift to a broader consideration of how landscape patterns
   influence connectivity at scales relevant to conservation. We further
   argue that this change in scale and definition of the connectivity
   problem improves one's ability to find solutions and may help resolve
   long-standing disputes regarding scale and definition of movement
   corridors and their importance to population connectivity. We used a new
   method that combines empirically derived landscape-resistance maps and
   least-cost path analysis between multiple source and destination
   locations to assess habitat isolation and identify corridors and
   barriers to organism movement. Specifically, we used a genetically based
   landscape resistance model for American black bears ( Ursus americanus)
   to identify major movement corridors and barriers to population
   connectivity between Yellowstone National Park and the Canadian border.
   Even though western Montana and northern Idaho contain abundant public
   lands and the largest wilderness areas in the contiguous United States,
   moving from the Canadian border to Yellowstone Park along those paths
   indicated by modeled gene flow required bears to cross at least 6
   potential barriers. Our methods are generic and can be applied to
   virtually any species for which reliable maps of landscape resistance

Abstract = {{Population viability analysis (PVA) to forecast extinction risk is a
   commonly used tool in decision- and policy-making processes of
   governments and conservation organizations. A drawback to PVA is the
   high degree of uncertainty in these forecasts due to both population
   stochasticity and parameter estimation uncertainty. With sparse or noisy
   data, extinction probabilities frequently have 95\% confidence intervals
   ranging from 0 to 1. To make stochastic simulation results more
   interpretable, we present a new metric, susceptibility to
   quasi-extinction (SQE), to assess whether or not a population is at risk
   of declining to a prespecified level (quasi-extinction). Following
   standard methods for diffusion approximation of extinction risk, we use
   a parametric bootstrap to determine the 95\% CI for the probability of
   quasi-extinction. SQE is the proportion of this parametric bootstrap
   that indicates a high (defined as >= 0.90) probability of
   quasi-extinction, resulting in a point estimate that integrates both
   parameter uncertainty and stochasticity in extinction forecasting. We
   demonstrate the application of the metric with sea turtle nest census
   data, which have a high degree of year-to-year variance and represent
   only a small fraction of the total population. Using population
   simulations, we found that for these types of data a critical SQE value
   of 0.40 corresponds to populations that have a true risk of
   quasi-extinction. The metric has an accuracy of >80\%, which can be
   increased further by lowering the 0.40 threshold and trading off Type I
   error (considering a population to be ``not at risk'' when it actually
   is) and Type II error (considering a population to be ``at risk'' when
   it actually is not), giving managers a flexible and quantitative tool
   for assessments of population status.}},

Abstract = {{Many evolutionary processes can lead to a change in the correlation
   between continuous characters over time or on different branches of a
   phylogenetic tree. Shifts in genetic or functional constraint, in the
   selective regime, or in some combination thereof can influence both the
   evolution of continuous traits and their relation to each other. These
   changes can often be mapped on a phylogenetic tree to examine their
   influence on multivariate phenotypic diversification. We propose a new
   likelihood method to fit multiple evolutionary rate matrices (also
   called evolutionary variance-covariance matrices) to species data for
   two or more continuous characters and a phylogeny. The evolutionary rate
   matrix is a matrix containing the evolutionary rates for individual
   characters on its diagonal, and the covariances between characters (of
   which the evolutionary correlations are a function) elsewhere. To
   illustrate our approach, we apply the method to an empirical dataset
   consisting of two features of feeding morphology sampled from 28
   centrarchid fish species, as well as to data generated via phylogenetic
   numerical simulations. We find that the method has appropriate type I

Abstract = {{The evolutionary history of a population involves changes in size,
   movements and selection pressures through time. Reconstruction of
   population history based on modern genetic data tends to be averaged
   over time or to be biased by generally reflecting only recent or extreme
   events, leaving many population historic processes undetected. Temporal
   genetic data present opportunities to reveal more complex population
   histories and provide important insights into what processes have
   influenced modern genetic diversity. Here we provide a synopsis of
   methods available for the analysis of ancient genetic data. We review 29
   ancient DNA studies, summarizing the analytical methods and general
   conclusions for each study. Using the serial coalescent and a
   model-testing approach, we then re-analyse data from two species
   represented by these data sets in a common interpretive framework. Our
   analyses show that phylochronologic data can reveal more about
   population history than modern data alone, thus revealing `cryptic'
   population processes, and enable us to determine whether simple or
   complex models best explain the data. Our re-analyses point to the need
   for novel methods that consider gene flow, multiple populations and
   population size in reconstruction of population history. We conclude
   that population genetic samples over large temporal and geographical

Abstract = {{In the past decade, numerous indicators and indicator sets for
   sustainable agriculture and sustainable land management have been
   proposed. In addition to their interest in comparing different
   management systems on an indicator by indicator basis, land managers are
   often interested in comparing individual indicators against a threshold,
   or, in order to study trade-offs, against each other. To this end it is
   necessary to (1) transform the original indicators into a comparable
   format, and (2) score these transformed indicators against a
   sustainability function.
   This paper introduces an evaluation method for land-use-related impact
   indicators, which was designed to accomplish these tasks. it is the
   second of a series of two papers, and as such it links into a larger
   framework for sustainability assessment of land use systems.
   The evaluation scheme introduced here comprises (1) a standardisation
   procedure, which aims at making different indicators comparable. In this
   procedure indicators are first normalised, by referencing them to the
   total impact they contribute towards, and then they are corrected by a
   factor describing the severity of this total impact in terms of
   exceeding a threshold. The procedure borrows conceptually from Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) Impact Analysis methodology; (2) a valuation
   procedure, which judges the individual standardised indicators with
   regard to sustainability.
   This methodology is then tested on an indicator set for the
   environmental impact of a spinach production system in Northwest
   Germany. The method highlights mineral resource consumption, greenhouse
   gas emission, eutrophication and impacts on soil quality as the most
   important environmental effects of the studied system.
   We then explore the effect of introducing weighting factors, reflecting
   the differing societal perception of diverse environmental issues. Two
   different sets of weighting factors are used.
   The influence of weighting is, however, small compared to that of the
   standardisation procedure introduced earlier.
   Finally, we explore the propagation of uncertainty (defined as a
   variable's 95\% confidence limits) throughout the standardisation
   procedure using a stochastic simulation approach. The uncertainty of the
   analysed standardised indicator was higher than that of the
   non-standardised indicators by a factor of 2.0 to 2.5. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The fact that plant invasions are an ongoing process makes
   generalizations of invasive spread extraordinarily challenging. This is
   particularly true given the idiosyncratic nature of invasions, in which
   both historical and local conditions affect establishment success and
   hinder our ability to generate guidelines for early detection and
   eradication of invasive species. To overcome these limitations we have
   implemented a comprehensive approach that examines plant invasions at
   three spatial scales: regional, landscape, and local levels. At each
   scale, in combination with the others, we have evaluated the role of key
   environmental variables such as climate, landscape structure, habitat
   type, and canopy closure in the spread of three commonly found invasive
   woody plant species in New England, Berberis thunbergii, Celastrus
   orbiculatus, and Euonymus alatus. We developed a spatially explicit
   hierarchical Bayesian model that allowed us to take into account the
   ongoing nature of the spread of invasive species and to incorporate
   presence/absence data from the species' native ranges as well as from
   the invaded regions. Comparisons between predictions from climate-only
   models with those from the multiscale forecasts emphasize the importance
   of including landscape structure in our models of invasive species'
   potential distributions. In addition, predictions generated using only
   native range data performed substantially worse than those that
   incorporated data from the target range. This points out important
   limitations in extrapolating distributional ranges from one region to

Abstract = {{Drought perturbation driven by the El NiA +/- o Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) is a principal stochastic variable determining the dynamics of
   lowland rain forest in S.E. Asia. Mortality, recruitment and stem growth
   rates at Danum in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo) were recorded in two 4-ha
   plots (trees a parts per thousand yen 10 cm gbh) for two periods,
   1986-1996 and 1996-2001. Mortality and growth were also recorded in a
   sample of subplots for small trees (10 to < 50 cm gbh) in two
   sub-periods, 1996-1999 and 1999-2001. Dynamics variables were employed
   to build indices of drought response for each of the 34 most abundant
   plot-level species (22 at the subplot level), these being
   interval-weighted percentage changes between periods and sub-periods. A
   significant yet complex effect of the strong 1997/1998 drought at the
   forest community level was shown by randomization procedures followed by
   multiple hypothesis testing. Despite a general resistance of the forest
   to drought, large and significant differences in short-term responses
   were apparent for several species. Using a diagrammatic form of
   stability analysis, different species showed immediate or lagged
   effects, high or low degrees of resilience or even oscillatory dynamics.
   In the context of the local topographic gradient, species' responses
   define the newly termed perturbation response niche. The largest
   responses, particularly for recruitment and growth, were among the small
   trees, many of which are members of understorey taxa. The results bring
   with them a novel approach to understanding community dynamics: the
   kaleidoscopic complexity of idiosyncratic responses to stochastic
   perturbations suggests that plurality, rather than neutrality, of
   responses may be essential to understanding these tropical forests. The
   basis to the various responses lies with the mechanisms of tree-soil
   water relations which are physiologically predictable: the timing and
   intensity of the next drought, however, is not. To date, environmental
   stochasticity has been insufficiently incorporated into models of
   tropical forest dynamics, a step that might considerably improve the
   reality of theories about these globally important ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystems can undergo large-scale changes in their states, known as
   catastrophic regime shifts, leading to substantial losses to services
   they provide to humans. These shifts occur rapidly and are difficult to
   predict. Several early warning signals of such transitions have recently
   been developed using simple models. These studies typically ignore
   spatial interactions, and the signal provided by these indicators may be
   ambiguous. We employ a simple model of collapse of vegetation in one and
   two spatial dimensions and show, using analytic and numerical studies,
   that increases in spatial variance and changes in spatial skewness occur
   as one approaches the threshold of vegetation collapse. We identify a
   novel feature, an increasing spatial variance in conjunction with a
   peaking of spatial skewness, as an unambiguous indicator of an impending
   regime shift. Once a signal has been detected, we show that a quick
   management action reducing the grazing activity is needed to prevent the
   collapse of vegetated state. Our results show that the difficulties in
   obtaining the accurate estimates of indicators arising due to lack of
   long temporal data can be alleviated when high-resolution spatially
   extended data are available. These results are shown to hold true
   independent of various details of model or different spatial dispersal

Abstract = {{The scientific community, forest managers, environmental organizations,
   carbon-offset trading systems and policy-makers require tools to account
   for forest carbon stocks and carbon stock changes. in this paper we
   describe updates to the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest
   Sector (CBM-CFS3) implemented over the past years. This model of
   carbon-dynamics implements a Tier 3 approach of the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Good Practice Guidance for reporting on
   carbon stocks and carbon stock changes resulting from Land Use, Land-use
   Change and Forestry (LULUCF). The CBM-CFS3 is a generic modelling
   framework that can be applied at the stand, landscape and national
   levels. The model provides a spatially referenced, hierarchical system
   for integrating datasets originating from different forest inventory and
   monitoring programs and includes a structure that allows for tracking of
   land areas by different land-use and land- use change classes. Ecosystem
   pools in CBM-CFS3 can be easily mapped to IPCC-defined pools and
   validated against field measurements. The model uses sophisticated
   algorithms for converting volume to biomass and explicitly simulates
   individual annual disturbance events (natural and anthropogenic).
   Several important scientific updates have been made to improve the
   representation of ecosystem structure and processes from previous
   versions of CBM-CFS. These include: (1) an expanded representation of
   dead organic matter and soil carbon, particularly standing dead trees,
   and a new algorithm for initializing these pools prior to simulation,
   (2) a change in the input data requirement for simulating growth from
   biomass to readily available merchantable volume curves, and new
   algorithms for converting volume to biomass, (3) improved prediction of
   belowground biomass, and (4) improved parameters for soil organic matter
   decay, fire, insect disturbances, and forest management. In addition, an
   operational-scale version of CBM-CFS3 is freely available and includes
   tools to import data in standard formats, including the output of
   several timber supply models that are commonly used in Canada. Although
   developed for Canadian forests, the flexible nature of the model has
   enabled it to be adapted for use in several other countries. Crown

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to explain the sources of energy system
   lock-in. it presents a comparative analysis of the respective
   contributions of some features of increasing returns to adoption
   factors, i.e. learning-by-doing, learning-by-searching and returns to
   scale effects in explaining the technological change dynamics in the
   energy system. The paper is technically based on a critical analysis of
   the learning curve approach. Econometric estimation of learning and
   scale effects inherent to seven energy technologies were performed by
   the use of several learning curve specifications. These specifications
   permit to deal with some crucial issues related to the learning curve
   estimation which are associated with the problem of omitted variable
   bias, the endogeneity effects and the choice of learning indicators.
   Results show that dynamic economies from learning effects coupled with
   static economies from scale effects are responsible for the lock-in
   phenomena of the energy system. They also show that the magnitude of
   such effects is correlated with the technology life cycle (maturity). In
   particular, results point out that, 1) the emerging technologies exhibit
   low learning rates associated with diseconomies of scale which are
   argued to be symptomatic of the outset of the deployment of new
   technologies characterized by diffusion barriers and high level of
   uncertainty, 2) the evolving technologies present rather high learning
   rates meaning that they respond quickly to capacity expansion and R\&D
   activities development, 3) conventional mature technologies display low
   learning rates but increasing returns to scale implying that they are
   characterized by a limited additional diffusion prospects. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Exploring the response of an ecosystem, and subsequent tradeoffs among
   its biological community, to human perturbations remains a key challenge
   for the implementation of an ecosystem approaches to fisheries (EAF). To
   address this and related issues, we developed two network (or energy
   budget) models, Ecopath and Econetwrk, for the Gulf of Maine ecosystem.
   These models included 31 network ``nodes{''} or biomass state variables
   across a broad range of trophic levels, with the present emphasis to
   particularly elucidate the role of small pelagics. After initial network
   balancing, various perturbation scenarios were evaluated to explore how
   potential changes to different fish, fisheries and lower trophic levels
   can affect model outputs. Categorically across all scenarios and
   interpretations thereof, there was minimal change at the second trophic
   levels and most of the ``rebalancing{''} after a perturbation occur-red
   via alteration of the diet matrix. Yet the model results from
   perturbations to a balanced energy budget fall into one of three
   categories. First, some model results were intuitive and in obvious
   agreement with established ecological and fishing theory. Second, some
   model results were counter-intuitive upon initial observation, seemingly
   contradictory to known ecological and fishing theory; but upon further
   examination the results were explainable given the constraints of an
   equilibrium energy budget. Finally, some results were counter-intuitive
   and difficult to reconcile with theory or further examination of
   equilibrium constraints. A detailed accounting of biomass flows for
   example scenarios explores some of the non-intuitive results more
   rigorously. Collectively these results imply a need to carefully track
   biomass flows and results of any given perturbation and to critically
   evaluate the conditions under which a new equilibrium is obtained for
   these types of models, which has implications for dynamic simulations
   based off of them. Given these caveats, the role of small pelagics as a
   prominent component of this ecosystem remains a robust conclusion. We
   discuss how one might use this approach in the context of further
   developing an EAF, recognizing that a more holistic, integrated
   perspective will be required as we continue to evaluate tradeoffs among
   marine biological communities. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Problem: Niche co-evolution deals Simultaneously with the number and the
   character of species within a community. How can a community of
   predators and prey adaptively radiate to fill available niches'? How
   many niches are there? And, can adaptive speciation at evolutionary
   branching points Successfully fill the niches of the ESS?
   Model features: We use a predator-prey model with one fitness-generating
   function, a G-function, for the prey and a separate one for the
   predators. Species diversity can emerge from within and between the two
   G-functions. Two niche-breadth parameters (prey niche breadth and
   predator niche breadth) determine the number of prey and predator
   species at the ESS.
   Mathematical method: To identify the ESS community for a given pair of
   niche parameters, We use a numerical approach. All possible strategies
   call invade at all times. We also apply adaptive dynamics, adaptive
   speciation, and the invasion of completely novel species to see how a
   starting community of a single prey and a single predator species can
   radiate to become the ESS community.
   Conclusion: In the absence of speciation or species invasions, adaptive
   dynamics cause the existing species to evolve to convergent stable niche
   archetypes. These archetypes may be local ESS strategies or evolutionary
   branching points (i.e. convergent stable fitness minima). Initially,
   adaptive speciation at branching points suffices to increase diversity
   from one set of niche archetypes to the next. On approaching the ESS
   community, speciation at one trophic level makes possible further
   diversification at the other trophic level. The final species to
   complete an ESS community may require invasions from species with quite
   different strategy values to those present in the Community. In the
   state space of prey and predator niche breadth, we can plot regions of
   iso-diversity for the ESS communities of prey and predators.}},

Abstract = {{Humans have traded and transported alien species for millennia with two
   notable step-changes: the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the
   Industrial Revolution. However, in recent decades the world has entered
   a new phase in the magnitude and diversity of biological invasions: the
   Era of Globalization. This Special Profile reviews the links between the
   main drivers of globalization and biological invasions and examines
   state-of-the-art approaches to pathway risk assessment to illustrate new
   opportunities for managing invasive species.
   Income growth is a primary driver of globalization and a clear
   association exists between Gross Domestic Product and the richness of
   alien floras and faunas for many regions of the world. In many cases,
   the exposure of these economies to trade is highlighted by the
   significant role of merchandise imports in biological invasions,
   especially for island ecosystems.
   Post-1950, technical and logistic improvements have accelerated the ease
   with which commodities are transported across the globe and hindered the
   traceability of goods and the ease of intercepting pests. New sea, land
   and air links in international trade and human transport have
   established novel pathways for the spread of alien species.
   Increasingly, the science advances underpinning invasive species
   management must move at the speed of commerce.
   Increasing transport networks and demand for commodities have led to
   pathway risk assessments becoming the frontline in the prevention of
   biological invasions. The diverse routes of introduction arising from
   contaminant, stowaway, corridor and unaided pathways, in both aquatic
   and terrestrial biomes are complex. Nevertheless, common features enable
   comparable approaches to risk assessment. By bringing together spatial
   data on climate suitability, habitat availability and points of entry,
   as well a demographic models that include species dispersal (both
   natural and human-mediated) and measures of propagule pressure, it is
   possible to generate risk maps highlighting potential invasion hotspots
   that can inform prevention strategies.
   Synthesis and applications. To date, most attempts to model pathways
   have focused on describing the likelihood of invader establishment. Few
   have modelled explicit management strategies such as optimal detection
   and inspection strategies and assessments of the effectiveness of
   different management measures. A future focus in these areas will ensure
   research informs response.}},

Abstract = {{Animals facing partial habitat loss can try to survive in the remaining
   habitat or emigrate. Effects on survival and movements should be studied
   simultaneously since survival rates may be underestimated if emigrants
   are not considered, and since emigrants may experience reduced survival.
   We analysed movements and survival of adult wintering oystercatcher
   Haematopus ostralegus in response to the 1986-1987 partial closure of
   the Oosterschelde in the Dutch Delta. This reduced by one-third the
   tidal area of this major European wintering area for waders.
   We developed a novel variant of a multistate capture-recapture model
   allowing simultaneous estimation of survival and movement between sites
   using a mixture of data (live recaptures and dead recoveries). We used a
   two-step process, first estimating movements between sites followed by
   site-specific survival rates.
   Most birds were faithful to their ringing site. Winter survival was
   negatively affected by winter severity and was lowest among birds
   changing wintering site (i.e. moving outside of the Oosterschelde).
   During mild winters, survival rates were very high, and similar to
   before the closure in both changed and unchanged sectors of the
   Oosterschelde. However, the combined effect of habitat loss with severe
   winters decreased the survival of birds from changed sectors and induced
   emigration.
   The coastal engineering project coincided with three severe winters and
   high food stock, making assessment of its effects difficult. However,
   the habitat loss seems to have had less impact on adult survival and
   movements than did winter severity.
   Synthesis and applications. Human-induced habitat change may result in
   population decline through costly emigration or reduced survival or
   reproduction of individuals that stay. Long-term monitoring of marked
   individuals helps to understand how populations respond to environmental
   change, but site-specific survival and movement rates should be
   integrated in the same model in order to maximize the information yield.
   Our modelling approach facilitates this because it allows the inclusion
   of recoveries from outside the study area.}},

Abstract = {{The in dividual-based (aka agent-based) approach is now well established
   in ecological modeling. Traditionally, most applications have been to
   organisms at higher trophic levels, where the importance of population
   heterogeneity (intra-population variability), complete life cycles and
   behavior adapted to internal and external conditions has been recognized
   for some time, However, advances in molecular biology and biochemistry
   have brought about an increase in the application of individual-based
   modeling (IBM) to microbes as well. This literature review summarizes 46
   IBM papers for bacteria in wastewater treatment plants, phytoplankton in
   ocean and inland waters, bacteria in biofilms, bacteria in food and
   other environs, and ``digital organisms{''} and ``domesticated computer
   viruses{''} in silico. The use of IBM in these applications was
   motivated by population heterogeneity (45\%), emergence (24\%), absence
   of a continuum (5\%), and other unknown reasons (26\%). In general, the
   challenges and concepts of IBM modeling for microbes and higher trophic
   levels are similar. However, there are differences in the microbe
   population dynamics and their environment that create somewhat different
   challenges, which have led to somewhat different modeling concepts.
   Several topics are discussed, including producing, maintaining and
   changing population heterogeneity (different life histories, internal
   variability, positive feedback, inter-generation memory), dealing with
   very large numbers of individuals (different up-scaling methods,
   including representative space vs. super-individual, number vs. biomass
   based, discrete vs. continuous kinetics, various agent accounting
   methods), handling space, simulating interactions with the extracellular
   environment (hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach), modeling agent-agent
   interaction (self-shading, predation, shoving) and passive transport
   (random walk with spatially variable diffusivity, well-mixed reactors).
   overall, the literature indicates that the application of IBM to
   microbes is developing into a mature field. However, several challenges
   remain, including simulating various types of agent-agent interactions
   (formation and function of colonies or filaments, sexual reproduction)
   and even smaller individuals (viruses, genes). Further increases in
   intracellular detail and complexity in microbe IBMs may be considered

Abstract = {{In the past four decades there have been tremendous changes in how
   environmental scientists address issues relating to societal needs. In
   the early 1980s, interdisciplinary work involved one or two related
   science disciplines in combination to evaluate national issues. As the
   success of interdisciplinary environmental science efforts was
   demonstrated and institutional boundaries were successfully crossed,
   great institutional progress was made. Many universities created
   Biological Science or Environmental Science Departments or even Schools
   and began to smear or fully obliterate some long-established
   disciplinary lines. However, Interdisciplinary Ph.D. graduates were
   scarce or not necessarily encouraged and leaders in these new efforts
   were generally those from disciplines that relied, inherently, on
   interdisciplinary perspectives. Now, in 2008, with the general movement
   to recognize the importance of ecosystem services to society and to
   value these services from the perspective of human well-being, another
   threshold looms that requires a trans-disciplinary perspective. The
   rewards to individuals as well as society in developing functionality
   with respect to transdisciplinary approaches are many and essential to
   continue to make progress in understanding and solving environmental
   problems that continue to become more complex.}},

Abstract = {{Measures of bird species richness, and the abundance or distribution of
   20 farmland species, 12 of them species of European conservation concern
   (SPECs), were modelled as a function of a number of habitat variables in
   six regions of Poland using information-theoretic methods. The strongest
   positive predictor of species richness of all species, of SPECs and of
   farmland specialists was the length of woody edge habitat. There was a
   curvilinear relationship between cereal cover and species richness
   measures, with total species richness reaching a peak at about 30\%
   cereal cover. Species richness was therefore highest in areas of mixed
   farming with a high proportion of woody edge habitat. The length of
   woody edge habitat was also the strongest predictor of the abundance of
   individual species, although the direction of this relationship varied.
   This modelling approach generated predictions about changes in bird
   species richness and abundance in response to agricultural change across
   Poland. Mixed farming with a high proportion of grassland and woody edge
   habitat is likely to maintain many of Poland's important farmland bird
   populations, but species-specific prescriptions will be needed for those

Abstract = {{A common explanation for hunting in groups is that doing so yields a
   greater per capita caloric benefit than hunting solitarily. This is
   logical for social carnivores, which rely exclusively on meat for
   energy, but arguably not for omnivores, which obtain calories from
   either plant or animal matter. The common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes,
   is one of the few true omnivores that regularly hunts in groups. Studies
   to date have yielded conflicting data regarding the payoffs of group
   hunting in chimpanzees. Here, we interpret chimpanzee hunting patterns
   using a new approach. In contrast to the classical assumption that
   hunting with others maximizes per capita caloric intake, we propose that
   group hunting is favored because it maximizes an individual's likelihood
   of obtaining important micronutrients that may be found in small
   quantities of meat. We describe a mathematical model demonstrating that
   group hunting may evolve when individuals can obtain micronutrients more
   frequently by hunting in groups than by hunting solitarily, provided
   that group size is below a certain threshold. Twenty five years of data
   from Gombe National Park, Tanzania are consistent with this prediction.
   We propose that our `meat-scrap' hypothesis is a unifying approach that
   may explain group hunting by chimpanzees and other social omnivores.}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{501-513}},
Abstract = {{The role of nutrients, such as phosphorus (P), and their impact on
   primary productivity and the fluctuations in atmospheric CO(2) over
   glacial-interglacial periods are intensely debated. Suggestions as to
   the importance of P evolved from an earlier proposal that P actively
   participated in changing productivity rates and therefore climate
   change, to most recent ones that changes in the glacial ocean inventory
   of phosphorus were important but not influential if compared to other
   macronutrients, such as nitrate. Using new data coming from a selection
   of ODP sites, we analyzed the distribution of oceanic P sedimentary
   phases and calculate reactive P burial fluxes, and we show how P burial
   fluxes changed over the last glacial-interglacial period at these sites.
   Concentrations of reactive P are generally lower during glacial times,
   while mass accumulation rates ( MAR) of reactive P show higher
   variability. If we extrapolate for the analyzed sites, we may assume
   that in general glacial burial fluxes of reactive P are lower than those
   during interglacial periods by about 8\%, because the lack of burial of
   reactive P on the glacial shelf reduced in size, was apparently not
   compensated by burial in other regions of the ocean. Using the
   calculated changes in P burial, we evaluate their possible impact on the
   phosphate inventory in the world oceans. Using a simple mathematical
   approach, we find that these changes alone could have increased the
   phosphate inventory of glacial ocean waters by 17-40\% compared to
   interglacial stages. Variations in the distribution of sedimentary P
   phases at the investigated sites seem to indicate that at the onset of
   interglacial stages, shallower sites experienced an increase in reactive
   P concentrations, which seems to point to P-richer waters at glacial
   terminations. All these findings would support the Shelf-Nutrient
   Hypothesis, which assumes that during glacial low stands nutrients are
   transferred from shallow sites to deep sea with possible feedback on the
   carbon cycle.}},

Abstract = {{The CEFLES2 campaign during the Carbo Europe Regional Experiment
   Strategy was designed to provide simultaneous airborne measurements of
   solar induced fluorescence and CO(2) fluxes. It was combined with
   extensive ground-based quantification of leaf- and canopy-level
   processes in support of ESA's Candidate Earth Explorer Mission of the
   `Fluorescence Explorer' (FLEX). The aim of this campaign was to test if
   fluorescence signal detected from an airborne platform can be used to
   improve estimates of plant mediated exchange on the mesoscale. Canopy
   fluorescence was quantified from four airborne platforms using a
   combination of novel sensors: (i) the prototype airborne sensor AirFLEX
   quantified fluorescence in the oxygen A and B bands, (ii) a
   hyperspectral spectrometer (ASD) measured reflectance along transects
   during 12 day courses, (iii) spatially high resolution georeferenced
   hyperspectral data cubes containing the whole optical spectrum and the
   thermal region were gathered with an AHS sensor, and (iv) the first
   employment of the high performance imaging spectrometer HYPER delivered
   spatially explicit and multi-temporal transects across the whole region.
   During three measurement periods in April, June and September 2007
   structural, functional and radiometric characteristics of more than 20
   different vegetation types in the Les Landes region, Southwest France,
   were extensively characterized on the ground. The campaign concept
   focussed especially on quantifying plant mediated exchange processes
   (photosynthetic electron transport, CO(2) uptake, evapotranspiration)
   and fluorescence emission. The comparison between passive sun-induced
   fluorescence and active laser-induced fluorescence was performed on a
   corn canopy in the daily cycle and under desiccation stress. Both
   techniques show good agreement in detecting stress induced fluorescence
   change at the 760 nm band. On the large scale, airborne and ground-level
   measurements of fluorescence were compared on several vegetation types
   supporting the scaling of this novel remote sensing signal. The
   multi-scale design of the four airborne radiometric measurements along
   with extensive ground activities fosters a nested approach to quantify
   photosynthetic efficiency and gross primary productivity (GPP) from
   passive fluorescence.}},

Abstract = {{The cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa is one of the few species able to
   build reef-like structures and a 3-dimensional coral framework in the
   deep oceans. Furthermore, deep cold-water coral bioherms may be among
   the first marine ecosystems to be affected by ocean acidification.
   Colonies of L. pertusa were collected during a cruise in 2006 to
   cold-water coral bioherms of the Mingulay reef complex (Hebrides, North
   Atlantic). Shortly after sample collection onboard these corals were
   labelled with calcium-45. The same experimental approach was used to
   assess calcification rates and how those changed due to reduced pH
   during a cruise to the Skagerrak (North Sea) in 2007. The highest
   calcification rates were found in youngest polyps with up to 1\%d(-1)
   new skeletal growth and average rates of 0.11 +/- 0.02\% d(-1)(+/-
   S.E.). Lowering pH by 0.15 and 0.3 units relative to the ambient level
   resulted in calcification being reduced by 30 and 56\%. Lower pH reduced
   calcification more in fast growing, young polyps (59\% reduction) than
   in older polyps (40\% reduction). Thus skeletal growth of young and fast
   calcifying corallites suffered more from ocean acidification.
   Nevertheless, L. pertusa exhibited positive net calcification (as
   measured by Ca-45 incorporation) even at an aragonite saturation state
   (Omega(a)) below 1.}},

Abstract = {{Kosovo has and is facing an unprecedented construction boom and growth
   of urban areas. Unfortunately, this growth is not adequately controlled
   and managed by the government, particularly the new political situation
   after the conflict and major economic changes that have triggered
   population migrations from rural areas to cities and throughout Kosovo
   in general. However, the cities are not prepared for such sudden influx
   of population. In addition, due to the lack of proper development
   control and disaster risk assessment and management, vulnerability to
   natural disasters in urban areas has considerably increased, which will
   undermine the sustainable growth of the cities in Kosovo.
   This paper explores how the risks of natural disasters are addressed in
   national policies and spatial planning in Kosovo and through a case
   study it is unveiled that the tendency is for areas vulnerable to
   natural disasters to be undergoing expansion. Throughout the analysis,
   practical approaches for disaster risk reduction and mitigation are
   introduced from a spatial planning perspective.}},

Title = {{Growth and Collapse of a Resource System: an Adaptive Cycle of Change in
   Public Lands Governance and Forest Management in Alaska}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Large-scale government efforts to develop resources for societal benefit
   have often experienced cycles of growth and decline that leave behind
   difficult social and ecological legacies. To understand the origins and
   outcomes of these failures of resource governance, scholars have applied
   the framework of the adaptive cycle. In this study, we used the adaptive
   cycle as a diagnostic approach to trace the drivers and dynamics of
   forest governance surrounding a boom-bust sequence of industrial forest
   management in one of the largest-scale resource systems in U. S.
   history: the Tongass National Forest in southeastern Alaska. Our
   application of the adaptive cycle combined a historical narrative
   tracing dynamics in political, institutional, and economic subsystems
   and a longitudinal analysis of an indicator of overall system behavior
   (timber harvests). We found that federal policies in concert with global
   market changes drove transformative change in both forest governance
   (policy making) and forest management (practices), through creation and
   dissolution of subsidized long-term lease contracts. Evidence of the
   systemic resilience provided by these leases was found in the analysis
   of industry responses to market volatility before and after
   Tongass-specific federal reforms. Although the lease contracts
   stabilized the Tongass system for a period of time, they fostered a
   growing degree of rigidity that contributed to a severe industrial
   collapse and the subsequent emergence of complex social traps. Broader
   lessons from the Tongass suggest that large-scale changes occurred only
   when the nested economic and policy cycles were in coherence, and a
   systemic effort to minimize social and ecological variability ultimately
   resulted in catastrophic collapse of governance. This collapse resulted
   in a pervasive and challenging legacy that prevents Tongass
   reorganization and limits the adaptive capacity of the larger
   social-ecological system of southeastern Alaska. Although this legacy
   has inhibited system renewal for two decades, recent trends indicate the
   emergence of new opportunities for progress toward sustainable
   governance of the Tongass National Forest.}},

Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Social contracts play an important role in defining the reciprocal
   rights, obligations, and responsibilities between states and citizens.
   Climate change is creating new challenges for both states and citizens,
   inevitably forcing a rethinking of existing and evolving social
   contracts. In particular, the social arrangements that enhance the
   well-being and security of both present and future generations are
   likely to undergo dramatic transformations in response to ecosystem
   changes, more extreme weather events, and the consequences of
   social-ecological changes in distant locations. The types of social

   considerable implications for adaptation policies and processes. We
   consider how a resilience approach can contribute to new social
   contracts in the face of uncertainty and change. Examples from Norway,
   New Zealand, and Canada show how resilience thinking provides a new way
   of looking at social contracts, emphasizing the dynamics, links, and
   complexity of coupled social-ecological systems. Resilience thinking
   provides valuable insights on the characteristics of a new social

Title = {{Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System have reached a scale where
   abrupt global environmental change can no longer be excluded. We propose
   a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary
   boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely.
   Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or
   even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will
   trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to
   planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries
   and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose
   quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2
   concentration in the atmosphere <350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W
   m(-2) in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater
   saturation state with respect to aragonite >= 80\% of pre-industrial
   levels); stratospheric ozone (<5\% reduction in O-3 concentration from
   pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N)
   cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N-2 to 35 Tg N
   yr(-1)) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to
   exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global
   freshwater use (<4000 km(3) yr(-1) of consumptive use of runoff
   resources); land system change (<15\% of the ice-free land surface under
   cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual
   rate of <10 extinctions per million species). The two additional
   planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a
   boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading.
   We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary
   boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes
   to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent,
   because transgressing one may both shift the position of other
   boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of
   transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social-ecological
   resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough,
   first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge
   gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System
   and resilience science. The proposed concept of ``planetary
   boundaries{''} lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to
   governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses
   of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward
   the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary
   boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the ``planetary playing
   field{''} for humanity if we want to be sure of avoiding major
   human-induced environmental change on a global scale.}},

Title = {{When to Spray: a Time-Scale Calculus Approach to Controlling the Impact
   of West Nile Virus}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{West Nile Virus (WNV) made its initial appearance in the New York City
   (NYC) metropolitan area in 1999 and was implicated in cases of human
   encephalitis and the extensive mortality in crows (Corvus sp.) and other
   avian species. Mosquitoes were found to be the primary vectors and NYC's
   current policy on control strategies involved an eradication program
   that depends on the synchronicity of the summer mosquito population's
   increases with the occurrence of cases in humans. The purpose of this
   paper is to investigate whether this is the most effective control
   strategy because past mathematical models assumed discrete behavior that
   is modeled by difference equations for a single summer season was most
   important to the virus's life cycle. However, both surviving mosquito
   eggs and surviving migratory birds incubate the virus during the winter,
   leading to a continuation of infections in the following warmer spring
   and summer when the birds return and the eggs hatch. Additionally, the
   virulence of WNV has been observed to fluctuate with changes in
   temperature toward warmer conditions. Models are required that account
   for these multi-seasonal dynamics and time-scale calculus is a newly
   developed method for resolving the behavior of systems that exhibit both
   discrete and continuous behavior. We found that, although the static
   states of the new temperature delay model are no different from older
   models, simulations indicate that the rate of the infection is affected
   by avian recovery at a lower temperature threshold. Consequently,
   eradication strategies should consider that controlling mosquitoes
   during the fall when colder temperatures occur would cause a fast and
   efficient drop to a disease-free state. This could prove rather more
   effective than mosquito control in the warmer months.}},

Title = {{Modeling the Effect of Traffic Calming on Local Animal Population
   Persistence}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{A steady growth in traffic volumes in industrialized countries with
   dense human populations is expected, especially on minor roads. As a
   consequence, the fragmentation of wildlife populations will increase
   dramatically. In human-dominated landscapes, typically minor roads occur
   in high densities, and animals encounter them frequently. Traffic
   calming is a new approach to mitigate negative impacts by reducing
   traffic volumes and speeds on minor roads at a regional scale. This
   leads to a distinction between roads with low volumes as being part of
   the traffic-calmed area, whereas roads with bundled traffic are located
   around this area. Within the traffic-calmed area, volumes and speeds can
   be decreased substantially; this is predicted to decrease the
   disturbance and mortality risk for animals. Thus far, data on the
   effects of traffic calming on wildlife population persistence remain
   scarce. Using metapopulation theory, we derived a model to estimate
   thresholds in the size of traffic-calmed areas and traffic volumes that
   may allow persistent populations. Our model suggests that traffic
   calming largely increases the persistence of roe deer in a landscape
   with a dense road network. Our modeling results show trade-offs between
   traffic volume on roads within the traffic-calmed area and both the area
   of habitat available for this species in the traffic-calmed area and the
   size of the traffic-calmed area. These results suggest ways to mitigate
   the fragmentation of wildlife habitat by road networks and their
   expected traffic volumes.}},

Abstract = {{Drought perturbation driven by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   is a principal stochastic variable determining the dynamics of lowland
   rain forest in S.E. Asia. Mortality, recruitment and stem growth rates
   at Danum in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo) were recorded in two 4-ha plots
   (trees >= 10 cm gbh) for two periods, 1986-1996 and 1996-2001. Mortality
   and growth were also recorded in a sample of subplots for small trees
   (10 to <50 cm gbh) in two sub-periods, 1996-1999 and 1999-2001. Dynamics
   variables were employed to build indices of drought response for each of
   the 34 most abundant plot-level species (22 at the subplot level), these
   being interval-weighted percentage changes between periods and
   sub-periods. A significant yet complex effect of the strong 1997/1998
   drought at the forest community level was shown by randomization
   procedures followed by multiple hypothesis testing. Despite a general
   resistance of the forest to drought, large and significant differences
   in short-term responses were apparent for several species. Using a
   diagrammatic form of stability analysis, different species showed
   immediate or lagged effects, high or low degrees of resilience or even
   oscillatory dynamics. In the context of the local topographic gradient,
   species' responses define the newly termed perturbation response niche.
   The largest responses, particularly for recruitment and growth, were
   among the small trees, many of which are members of understorey taxa.
   The results bring with them a novel approach to understanding community
   dynamics: the kaleidoscopic complexity of idiosyncratic responses to
   stochastic perturbations suggests that plurality, rather than
   neutrality, of responses may be essential to understanding these
   tropical forests. The basis to the various responses lies with the
   mechanisms of tree-soil water relations which are physiologically
   predictable: the timing and intensity of the next drought, however, is
   not. To date, environmental stochasticity has been insufficiently
   incorporated into models of tropical forest dynamics, a step that might
   considerably improve the reality of theories about these globally
   important ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{A fashionable field of enquiry - the relationship between expressed
   attitudes and actual behaviour in the context of sustainable development
   - is complex (Staats et al. 2004) and difficult to apply in a
   policy-relevant manner (Aall and Norland 2005). However, recent research
   indicates that the use of a household diary can be beneficial in helping
   to quantify household environmental impact, in educating householders
   about their impact, and in identifying major `behavioural turning
   points', where householders may focus efforts to reduce their
   environmental impact (Hunter et al. 2006). In other words, the use of a
   diary by householders is a potentially powerful tool in encouraging and
   facilitating desired behavioural change. This paper reports on the
   initial findings of an innovative study that assessed the use of a
   household diary approach as a means of framing and collecting household
   environmental data and, critically, as an educational vehicle for
   bringing about behavioural change. Based on the initial findings, it is
   clear that there is some potential to develop practical policy measures
   that empower householders by allowing them to better grasp their
   environmental impact and, consequently, recoup positive implications in
   terms of financial savings (e.g. reducing the amount of food thrown out)
   and health benefits (e.g. more walking/cycling).}},

Abstract = {{A wide range of human impacts have resulted in changes to wetland water
   regimes throughout the natural reserve of the Yellow River Delta.
   Specific local impacts which affect wetland water regimes include
   hydrological alterations associated with urban and agricultural
   development.. Increasingly, management decisions must be made regarding
   the amount and timing of water required to maintain the ecosystem's
   diversity and its ecological characteristics. In this paper, based on
   the practice in the natural reserve and the important request of Ramsar
   for the ``wise use{''} of wetlands in which ecological characteristics
   need to be reserved, a set of management objectives for the wetland
   natural reserve is proposed. The objectives include protecting the
   ecosystem and the waterfowl resources in the new wetland, renewing
   biodiversity and maintaining the function of the ecosystem. By means of
   a correlation analysis between the wetland biota and water regime, the
   ecological water requirement for the wetlands is proposed and classified
   into three classes, i.e., minimum, moderate and perfect water
   requirement, corresponding to the basic, moderate and perfect management
   objective, respectively. The results show that the minimum, moderate and
   perfect water requirements, respectively, are 37.94 x 10(8), 49.47 x
   10(8) and 64.57 x 10(8) m(3) per year if the water required for sediment

Abstract = {{Road mortality is often spatially aggregated, and there is a need for
   models that accurately and efficiently predict hot spots within a road
   network for mitigation. We surveyed 145 points throughout a 353-km
   highway network in New York State, USA, for roadkill of reptiles and
   amphibians. We used land cover, wetland configuration, and traffic
   volume data to identify features that best predicted hot spots of
   herpetofauna road mortality. We resampled 40 points an additional 4
   times over 4 years to evaluate temporal repeatability. Both amphibian
   and reptile road mortality were spatially clustered, and road-kill hot
   spots of the 2 taxa overlapped. One survey provided a valid snapshot of
   spatial patterns of road mortality, and spatial patterns remained stable
   across time. Road-kill hot spots were located where wetlands approached
   within 100 m of the road, and the best predictor was a causeway
   configuration of wetlands ( wetlands on both sides of the road). We
   validated causeways as predictors of road mortality by surveying 180
   causeways and 180 random points across 5 regions ( 17,823 km 2) of
   northeastern New York. Causeways were 3 times more likely than random
   locations to have amphibian and 12 times more likely to have reptile
   mortality present, and causeways had a 4 times higher total number of
   amphibian roadkill and 9 times higher reptile roadkill than did random
   points. We conclude it is possible to identify valid predictors of hot
   spots of amphibian and reptile road mortality for use when planning
   roads or when conducting surveys on existing roads to locate priority
   areas for mitigation. ( JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT 73( 1): 104-114;

Abstract = {{Many delphinids feed on vertically migrating sound-scattering layers.
   The migration of micronektonic animals in these layers is strongly

   used to observe lunar phase effects on the diel patterns of
   sound-scattering layers in 2 habitats and to simultaneously observe the
   behavior of foraging spinner dolphins Stenella longirostris in Hawaii
   and dusky dolphins Lagenorhynchus obscurus in New Zealand. Lunar phase
   was important in structuring the behavior of diurnally migrating animals
   in scattering layers off both New Zealand and Hawaii. While the
   responses of these scattering layers to lunar phase differed between
   locations, the layers were similar in continuing to migrate to surface
   waters during all moon phases, in contrast to results from other
   locations. In both dusky and spinner dolphins, dolphin relative
   abundance increased with increasing lunar illumination. The dolphin
   response to lunar phase is not clearly explained by the observed changes
   in prey. However, the results suggest that lunar phase is likely to be
   important in driving behavior of the many delphinid species that forage
   on vertically migrating prey. Active acoustics can be used to
   simultaneously study predator and prey, elucidating the foraging

Pages = {{121-137}},
Abstract = {{In this review we detail the impact of climate change on marine
   productivity, on marine environmental stochasticity and cyclicity, and
   on the spatio-temporal match-mismatch of seabirds and their prey. We
   thereby show that global warming has a profound bottom-up impact upon
   marine top-predators, but that such effects have to be studied in
   conjunction with the (top-down) impact of human fisheries upon seabird
   food resources. Further, we propose seabird ecological features, such as
   memory effects and social constraints, that make them particularly
   sensitive to rapid environmental change. We provide examples of how
   seabirds may nonetheless adapt when facing the consequences of climate
   change. We conclude that our understanding of the spatial ecology of
   seabirds facing environmental change is still rudimentary, despite its
   relevance for the conservation of these vulnerable organisms and for the
   management of marine ecosystems. We define the following research
   priorities. (1) Determine the factors affecting seabird distribution and
   movements at sea using biotelemetry, as well as colony dynamics on land.
   (2) Link seabird distribution patterns to those of their prey, (3)
   Determine further the role of historical and metapopulation processes in
   contributing to the dynamics of the spatial distribution of seabirds.
   (4) Assess phenotypic plasticity and the potential for microevolution
   within seabird spatial responses to climate change, since both will
   greatly affect the quality of modelling studies. (5) Adapt existing
   models to define and predict the impact of climate change onto seabird
   spatial dynamics. (6) Synthesize all gathered information to define
   marine protected areas and further conservation schemes, such as
   capacity reduction of fisheries. This research effort will require
   maintaining existing long-term monitoring programmes for seabirds, as
   well as developing new approaches to permit the integration of processes
   occurring at various scales, in order to be able to fully track the

Abstract = {{The response of 5 strains of shallow-water microbes to changing
   hydrostatic pressure was explored in a pressurized microcosm setup,
   simulating a sinking at 1000 m d(-1) from surface waters to 4000 m depth
   in an isothermal ocean. Technology and methods combined a new,
   computer-controlled pressure laboratory with classical and new genetic
   tools to evaluate pressure responses of selected bacterial strains.
   Size, number, growth and species composition were obtained in a time
   series pattern under regular, non-saturating feeding. Planned as an
   initial step in a quest for quantifying the role of hydrostatic pressure
   in observed oceanic microbial distributions, results from this study
   indicate that selected bacterial strains from the surface respond
   individually to pressure exposure. A strong physiological response led
   to reduced bacterial numbers of all strains at 4000 m depth, a result
   corroborated elsewhere in the literature. Unexpectedly, pressure changes
   (during sinking) generated depth-specific maxima and minima in number of
   the selected strains, not seen in the ambient pressure control. A
   reshuffling of species and changes in sizes of all strains tested
   occurred in the pressurized treatment. Therefore, time series
   experiments with non-intrusive sampling features rather than end-member
   experiments become mandatory to document physiological responses to
   pressure. Our results, together with recent findings on pressure-related
   effects on microbial growth and community structure in the deep-sea,
   indicate that estimates of microbial organic matter turnover in the
   deep-sea-not taking pressure-related effects into account-need to be

   Next, the organic carbon (OC) flux at a pristine site near the farm was
   estimated by fitting the vertical profiles of pore water and solid-state

   the fluxes of OC due to the release of uneaten feed and faeces at
   various distances away from the farm. These fluxes were added to the
   background `natural' fluxes and used as forcing functions for the RTM.
   Comparison of the simulated transient profiles with data collected at an

Abstract = {{We used a comparative approach to investigate heteroblasty in the
   Chatham Islands. Heteroblasty refers to abrupt changes in the morphology
   of leaves and shoots with plant height. Common on isolated islands such
   as New Caledonia and New Zealand, which once had flightless, browsing
   birds, heteroblasty is hypothesised to be an adaptation to deter bird
   browsing. The Chatham Islands arc a small archipelago located 800 km off
   the cast coast of New Zealand, which has clear floristic links to New
   Zealand. However, unlike New Caledonia and New Zealand, the Chathams
   never had flightless, browsing birds. We investigated heteroblasty on
   the Chatham Islands by: (1) comparing height-related changes in leaf
   morphology and branching architecture in several plant taxa with
   heteroblastic relatives on the New Zealand mainland; (2) characterising
   changes in leaf morphology in heteroblastic tree species endemic to the
   Chathams; and (3) comparing overall trends in leaf heteroblasty on the
   Chathams with New Caledonia and New Zealand. Reversions to homoblasty
   were observed in the three Chatham Island taxa with heteroblastic
   relatives on the New Zealand mainland. However, two endemic tree species
   were clearly heteroblastic; both produced dramatically larger leaves as
   juveniles than as adults. Inter-archipelago comparisons showed that this
   trend in leaf morphology is rare among heteroblastic species in New
   Caledonia and New Zealand. Therefore, while some of our results were
   consistent with the hypothesis that heteroblasty is an adaptation to
   avoid bird browsing, other processes also appear to have shaped the
   expression of heteroblasty on Chatham Island.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Myrmecochory, i.e. dispersal of seeds by ants towards and around their
   nests, plays an important role in temperate forests. Yet hardly any
   study has examined plant population spread over several years and the
   underlying joint contribution of a hierarchy of dispersal modes and
   plant demography. We used a seed-sowing approach with three replicates
   to examine colonization patterns of Melampyrum pratense, an annual
   myrmecochorous herb, in a mixed Scots pine forest in north-eastern
   Germany. Using a spatially explicit individual-based (SEIB) model
   population patterns over 4 years were explained by short-distance
   transport of seeds by small ant species with high nest densities,
   resulting in random spread. However, plant distributions in the field
   after another 4 years were clearly deviating from model predictions.
   Mean annual spread rate increased from 0.9 to 5.1 m per year, with a
   clear inhomogeneous component. Obviously, after a lag-phase of several
   years, non-random seed dispersal by large red wood ants (Formica rufa)
   was determining the species' spread, thus resulting in stratified
   dispersal due to interactions with different-sized ant species.
   Hypotheses on stratified dispersal, on dispersal lag, and on non-random
   dispersal were verified using an extended SEIB model, by comparison of
   model outputs with field patterns (individual numbers, population areas,
   and maximum distances). Dispersal towards red wood ant nests together
   with seed loss during transport and redistribution around nests were
   essential features of the model extension. The observed lag-phase in the
   initiation of non-random, medium-distance transport was probably due to
   a change of ant behaviour towards a new food source of increasing
   importance, being a meaningful example for a lag-phase in local plant
   species invasion. The results demonstrate that field studies should
   check model predictions wherever possible. Future research will show
   whether or not the M. pratense-ant system is representative for
   migration patterns of similar animal dispersal systems after having
   crossed range edges by long-distance dispersal events. (C) 2008 Rubel

   tongues, their flow velocities and front position changes have been
   extracted from ASTER images acquired from 2000-2006 using automated
   methods of satellite image analysis. Analyses have shown that 163
   Svalbard glaciers are of tidewater type (having contact with the ocean)
   and the total length of their calving ice-cliffs is 860 km. When
   compared with the previous inventory, 14 glaciers retreated from the
   ocean to the land over a 30-40 year period. Eleven formerly land-based
   glaciers now terminate in the sea. A new method of assessing the dynamic
   state of glaciers, based on patterns of frontal crevassing, has been
   developed. Tidewater glacier termini are divided into four groups on the
   basis of differences in crevasse patterns and flow velocity: (1) very
   slow or stagnant glaciers, (2) slow-flowing glaciers, (3) fast-flowing
   glaciers, (4) surging glaciers (in the active phase) and fast ice
   streams. This classification has enabled us to estimate total calving
   flux from Svalbard glaciers with an accuracy appreciably higher than
   that of previous attempts. Mass loss due to calving from the whole
   archipelago (excluding Kvitoya) is estimated to be 5.0-8.4 km(3) yr(-1)
   (water equivalent - w.e.), with a mean value 6.75 1.7 km3 yr(-1) (w.e.).
   Thus, ablation due to calving contributes as much as 17-25\% (with a
   mean value 21\%) to the overall mass loss from Svalbard glaciers. By
   implication, the contribution of Svalbard iceberg flux to sea-level rise
   amounts to ca 0.02 mm yr(-1). Also calving flux in the Arctic has been
   considered and the highest annual specific mass balance attributable to
   iceberg calving has been found for Svalbard.}},

Title = {{Digital Imaging information Technology Applied to Seed Germination
   Testing: A Review}},
Booktitle = {{SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Pages = {{377-388}},
Abstract = {{The application of digital imaging information technology to seed
   germination testing is discussed. This technology is reviewed in light
   of recent interest on the development and adoption of sustainable
   agrosystems joined with a modern strategy of ``precision
   agriculture{''}, which provides new complex information tools for better
   crop production. Basic concepts on the patterns of image analysis
   descriptors of imbibing seed performance are described with the
   objective of demonstrating the potential of this technique to be
   adequate for overcoming problems encountered with a standard seed
   germination test. The application of different image analysis system
   prototypes in monitoring seed germination of Brassica, as well as
   several other crop species, has provided encouraging results,
   highlighting the reliability of this technique to quickly acquire
   digital images and to extract numeric descriptors of germination and
   radicle growth events. Another aspect of digital imaging is the
   possibility to determine the colour space of a two-dimensional seed
   surface. Experiments carried out on lentil seed germination have shown
   that quantitative changes in Red-Green-Blue (RGB) colour component
   density may be considered as markers of the start of germination. In
   addition, the extracted RGB data may be used to trace a virtual
   three-dimensional surface plot allowing a better analysis of colour
   distribution on the lentil's surface. RGB colour density can also be
   used to determine any variation in colour due to the `browning effect'
   as a result of advancing seed deterioration. The potential of RGB
   markers in classifying sub-samples and maintaining high germination
   quality in aged seed samples represents a non-destructive method in seed
   testing and sorting. As a conclusion, the information flow deriving from
   digital image processing should be integrated with other
   bio-morphological, taxonomic and `omic-system' databases. The final
   target should be an interrelated and complex database for a deeper
   functional and structural knowledge of plant species, which can respond
   to the needs of farmers, seed industries, biodiversity conservation and
   seed basic research.}},

Title = {{Sustainable Pest Management for Cotton Production: A Review}},
Booktitle = {{SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Pages = {{411+}},
Abstract = {{Cotton cultivation, often highlighted for its excessive consumption of
   plant protection products, is taken as a model to illustrate the
   development of the ideas and practices of crop protection over the last
   50 years. Cotton is grown in 69 countries on 30-35 million hectares and
   the production exceeded 20 million tones of lint in recent years.
   Despite the continual improvement in the performance of chemical control
   strategies, harvest losses remain very high, of about 30\%. The largest
   consumer of pesticides in the world, the cotton production system has
   the advantage of having been an experimental model for many crop
   protection programmes under various agronomic conditions and in the
   presence of diverse pest complexes. Without attempting an exhaustive
   bibliography, this review explores how and why the ideas underlying crop
   protection have significantly evolved since the advent of synthetic
   pesticides. After a spectacular demonstration of yield growth through
   the application of chemical control, cotton production was rapidly
   confronted by the secondary effects of this control. These included the
   appearance of evolved insecticide resistance and the appearance of new
   damage caused by pests considered up to then as of only secondary
   importance. In extreme cases, the economic viability of the production
   systems themselves have been compromised following increases in the
   application rate and frequency of insecticidal treatments. In general,
   harvest losses have remained high despite the constantly improving
   technical performance of pest control chemicals. Two models of the
   future of crop protection can be drawn: total pest management which
   involves the eradication of pests, and integrated pest management (IPM),
   which aims at the management of pest populations below economic
   thresholds by a mixture of chemical control and a suite of alternative
   control measures. The first method, total pest management is limited in
   agricultural systems to particular cases in which the pest in question
   has no significant alternate hosts in the vicinity of the crop system.
   On the other hand, the application of IPM is constrained both by the
   difficulties in exploiting the concept of an `intervention threshold'
   and by the limitations of many of the specific non-chemical techniques
   proposed, but does have the advantage of taking into consideration the
   full pest complex in a cropping system. In practice, it has been a
   calendar schedule, largely of insecticidal treatments, established on
   the basis of earlier local observations which has been most widely
   adopted by growers. This strategy has produced significant improvements
   in production in the cotton producing countries of francophone Africa
   and elsewhere. This has led to area-wide integrated pest management
   which takes into account the potential for natural factors to regulate
   populations in a specific region. In cotton production, biological
   control by introduction and acclimation of beneficial arthropods has not
   been notably successful because of the difficulty of developing a suite
   of beneficial organisms capable of responding effectively to the
   diversity of pests in the system, the annual nature of the crop, and the
   disrupting effects of chemical control measures directed against the
   remaining pests. Only inundative biological control has had significant
   success and then in particular cases where the pressure}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{342-352}},
Abstract = {{Chloropicrin (CLPN) is used in Australia and New Zealand as a warren
   fumigant for the control of exotic European rabbits (Oryctolagus
   cuniculus) but is no longer registered for this purpose in the United
   States or the European Union. This review summarises the mammalian
   toxicology and clinical records from 56 accounts where signs, symptoms
   and pathology have been related to a range of CLPN concentrations. The
   approach follows a general principle where an assessment of the
   humaneness of vertebrate pest control techniques should be firstly based
   upon a thorough synopsis of published behavioural, physiological and
   pathological impacts. Chloropicrin produces intense irritation by
   stimulation of trigeminal nerves and brief exposures to concentrations
   of <= 1 ppm can severely irritate the eyes and cause lacrimation in
   mammals. Beyond 8 ppm, exposures are reported to be painful and
   incapacitating in humans. Mammals experience an array of common signs
   and symptoms including: headache, nausea, diarrhoea, laboured breathing,
   decrease in spontaneous motor activity, salivation, rhinorrhea, blood
   stains around the nose and mouth, painful irritation of mucous
   membranes, profuse lacrimation, audible obstruction of respiration and
   distress vocalisation. Acute pathological changes from CLPN exposure can
   cause death in mammals from pulmonary oedema, bronchopneumonia,
   emphysema or general destructive changes and necrosis of the small and
   medium bronchi. Overall, the signs, symptoms and pathology arising from
   CLPN exposure at any airborne concentration beyond 0.3 ppm indicate that
   it must be assumed to cause suffering in all mammals. Exposure to CLPN
   that is not acutely lethal may debilitate rabbits and other species and
   cause a protracted death over hours or days. To produce a humane death a
   fumigant must be non-irritating, have an initial depressive action on
   the central nervous system and/or produce a rapid death without
   protracted distress while having little ability to cause debilitation or
   chronic injury. Given that CLPN has none of these characteristics, it
   cannot be considered to be acceptably humane.}},

Title = {{Effect of prefeeding on foraging patterns of brushtail possums
   (Trichosurus vulpecula) about prefeed transects}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{659-665}},
Abstract = {{Context. Brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) are a major pest of
   native biodiversity and agricultural production in New Zealand. To
   maximise the effectiveness of control operations, prefeeding
   (free-feeding) of non-toxic bait before poison is often used, but the
   mechanisms by which it does so, remain unclear. One possibility is that
   prefeeding changes foraging patterns and space use in ways that increase
   the likelihood of possums finding and eating a lethal dose of poison
   bait.
   Aim. To determine whether prefeeding along transects increases possum
   activity on the transect, and if so, how long the effect lasts.
   Methods. We monitored the time that radio-collared possums spent within
   a few metres of 350m of aerial wire laid along a transect.
   Key results. Initially, possums spent only 2.6 min per night in the
   vicinity of the wire, but after 20 kg of bait per kilometre were placed
   along the wire, that time increased 20-fold on the first night and
   remained high for the next four nights (by which time all of the bait
   had been consumed). After that there was a gradual decline in time spent
   near the wire over a further 18 days. The increased amount of time spent
   near the wire was the product of both an increase in the number of
   visits and the duration of those visits.
   Conclusions. We conclude that sowing prefeed in concentrated strips is
   likely to greatly increase the probability of possums rapidly
   encountering toxic bait sown along the same strips, especially where the
   toxin can be sown immediately after all of the prefeed has been eaten.
   Implications. Possum control operations can now be designed to apply
   much smaller quantities of toxic bait that will potentially reduce
   concerns about 1080 poisoning because of a move away from broadcast
   sowing operations that are intuitively disliked by many, to much more
   localised baiting regimes.}},

   derivation was guided by theoretical considerations and regression
   techniques, to generate realistic Db, FC, PWP and K-sat values with
   sand, clay, organic matter content and soil depth as the only predictor
   variables, each with low inter-coefficient correlations. The results
   ensure that Db <= Dp (soil particle density), FC <= SP(soil saturation

   PWP, log(10)(K-sat), data variations are represented as follows: R-2 =
   0.83, 0.96, 0.65 and 0.79, respectively. In addition, the associated

   other approaches. The equations can be used to quantify expected changes

Abstract = {{Because of the heterogeneity of natural landscapes, animals have to move

   intensively used areas makes it possible, through subsequent analyses,
   to address both how they are distributed with respect to key habitat
   features, and the underlying behavioral mechanisms used to find these
   areas and capitalize on such habitats. We critically reviewed the few

Year = {{2008}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Galapagos Islands are among the most renowned natural sites in the
   world. Unlike other oceanic archipelagos, the ecological and
   evolutionary processes characteristic of Galapagos have been minimally
   affected by human activities, and the archipelago still retains most of
   its original, unique biodiversity. However, several recent reports
   suggest that the development model has turned unsustainable and that the
   unique values of the archipelago might be seriously at risk. In response
   to international concern, UNESCO added Galapagos to the list of World
   Heritage in Danger in 2007. Our goal was to provide new insights into
   the origins of the present-day crisis and suggest possible management
   alternatives. To this end, we re-examined the Galapagos situation from a
   broad systems perspective, conceptualizing the archipelago as a complex
   social-ecological system. Past, present, and possible future trends were
   explored using the resilience theory as a perspective for understanding
   the dynamics of the system. Four major historical periods were
   characterized and analyzed using Holling's adaptive cycle metaphor. The
   current Galapagos situation was characterized as a prolonged series of
   crisis events followed by renewal attempts that have not yet been
   completed. Three plausible future scenarios were identified, with
   tourism acting as the primary driver of change. The current tourism
   model reduces the system's resilience through its effects on the
   economy, population growth, resource consumption, invasive species
   arrival, and lifestyle of the island residents. Opportunities to
   reorganize and maintain a desirable state do exist. However, strong
   political and management decisions are urgently needed to avoid an
   irreversible shift to a socially and environmentally undesirable regime.
   Key measures to achieve a new sustainability paradigm for Galapagos
   include modifying traditional practices to produce a more adaptive
   resilience-based co-management model, adopting a more comprehensive
   approach to territorial planning, strengthening participative approaches
   and institutional networks, and promoting transdisciplinary research at
   the frontiers of social and biophysical sciences.}},

Abstract = {{1. Managers must understand the effects of stressors on ecosystems in

   2. We investigated the individual and combined effects of the principal
   stressors (nutrient concentration and streambed fine sediment cover)
   operating in native grassland streams converted to pasture in New
   Zealand, using two different approaches: a survey of 32 small streams
   and an experiment involving nine streams where the stressors were

   3. Up to half the taxa and most community metrics responded to at least

Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   We investigate the effect of position within a size-structured
   population on the reproductive allocation (RA) and flowering probability
   of individual plants of Sinapis arvensis. We also assess the effects of
   plant size and changing level of CO2 on both responses.
   Methods
   Sinapis arvensis L., (field mustard), an annual agricultural weed, was
   grown in monoculture at six densities Under ambient and elevated CO2 in
   a study with 84 stands. Individual aboveground biomass and reproductive
   biomass were measured. Varying density produced a wide range of mean
   plant sizes across stands and size hierarchies within stands. Many
   (similar to 40\%) individuals bad zero reproductive biomass. Employing a
   novel modelling approach, we analysed the joint effects of position in
   stand size hierarchy, plant size and CO2 on RA and flowering probability
   of individuals.
   Important Findings
   We found a strong effect of position within the size hierarchy of
   individuals in a population: for an individual of a given size, greater
   size relative to neighbours Substantially increased RA and flowering
   probability at a single harvest time. There was no other effect of plant
   size on RA. We found a positive effect of elevated CO, on RA regardless
   of position within the size hierarchy. These observed patterns Could
   impact doubly on the reproductive biomass (R) of small individuals.
   First, because RA is not affected by size, smaller plants will have
   smaller R than larger plants; and second, for smaller plants lower down
   in population size hierarchy, their RA and hence R will be further
   reduced. These results Suggest that size relative to neighbours may be
   independent of and more important than direct abiotic effects in
   determining RA. Further Studies are required to evaluate how these
   observed patterns generalize to other populations in non-experimental
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Suitable methods to describe and predict soil degradation in mountain
   areas with low accessibility, steep topography and extreme climate are
   urgently needed for suitable planning processes in Alpine regions under
   global change regime.
   Aerial photograph mapping has been proven to be a valuable tool in
   surveying landslide development over time. However, landslides< 10 m(2)
   as well as sheet erosion have been difficult to detect. Thus, the
   beginning of potentially heavy soil degradation cannot be tracked with
   aerial photographs.
   As an early warning system for soil degradation, we analyzed gradients
   of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen from upland (erosion source)
   to wetland soils (erosion sink). Oxic upland soils and anoxic wetlands
   differ in their isotopic signature, due to differing isotopic
   fingerprints of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in soils. Gradients of
   delta(15)N and delta(13)C in soils reflected erosion of material.
   However, if soils were fertilized with manure, the delta(15)N profiles
   were obscured.
   To quantify soil erosion, we noted that existing soil erosion models are
   generally unsuitable for mountain regions. As a first step, we developed
   a new modelling concept with a special algorithm for spatial

Abstract = {{Sky islands provide ideal opportunities for understanding how climatic
   changes associated with Pleistocene glacial cycles influenced species
   distributions, genetic diversification, and demography. The salamander
   Plethodon ouachitae is largely restricted to high-elevation, mesic
   forest on six major mountains in the Ouachita Mountains. Because these
   mountains are separated by more xeric, low-elevation valleys, the
   salamanders appear to be isolated on sky islands where gene flow among
   populations on different mountains may be restricted. We used DNA
   sequence data along with ecological niche modelling and coalescent
   simulations to test several hypotheses related to diversifications in
   sky island habitats. Our results revealed that P. ouachitae is composed
   of seven well-supported lineages structured across six major mountains.
   The species originated during the Late Pliocene, and lineage
   diversification occurred during the Middle Pleistocene in a stepping
   stone fashion with a cyclical pattern of dispersal to a new mountain
   followed by isolation and divergence. Diversification occurred primarily
   on an east-west axis, which is likely related to the east-west
   orientation of the Ouachita Mountains and the more favourable cooler and
   wetter environmental conditions on north slopes compared to south-facing
   slopes and valleys. All non-genealogical coalescent methods failed to
   detect significant population expansion in any lineages. Bayesian
   skyline plots showed relatively stable population sizes over time, but
   indicated a slight to moderate amount of population growth in all
   lineages starting approximately 10 000-12 000 years ago. Our results
   provide new insight into sky island diversifications from a previously
   unstudied region, and further demonstrate that climatic changes during
   the Pleistocene had profound effects on lineage diversification and
   demography, especially in species from environmentally sensitive
   habitats in montane regions.}},

Abstract = {{The consensus view that the amount of rock available for sampling does
   not significantly and systematically bias Phanerozoic marine diversity
   patterns has broken down. How changes in rock availability and sampling
   intensity affect our estimates of past biodiversity has been
   investigated with a variety of new approaches. A number of proxies for
   the amount of rock available for sampling have been used, but most of
   these proxies do not rely directly on evidence from large-scale
   geological maps (maps that cover small areas) and accompanying memoirs.
   Most previous map-based studies focused on single regions or relied on
   small-scale synoptic maps. We collected data from published geological
   maps and memoirs from western Europe, Australia, and Chile, which we
   combined with COSUNA data from the United States to generate the first
   multiregional data set for investigating whether the global Phanerozoic
   marine diversity record is a true global record, or is instead biased
   toward North America and Western Europe as has long been suspected. Both
   short and long-term trends in variation in the amount of outcrop display
   limited correlation among the regions studied. A series of
   diversification models obtained better matches to observed fossil
   diversity from the European and U.S. records than for the Chilean and
   Australian records, further supporting suspicions that the global
   Phanerozoic diversity curve is disproportionately influenced by European
   and U.S. fossil data. These results indicate that future research into
   Phanerozoic marine diversity patterns should not continue to apply
   global eustatic curves as a proxy for rock at outcrop, but should use
   regional data on rock occurrence.}},

Abstract = {{Current and predicted trends indicate that an increasing proportion of
   the world's population is living in urban and suburban places. The
   nature of the urban environment becomes an important factor if we are
   concerned with the restoration and preservation of biodiversity and
   ecosystems in and around cities. This article highlights the varied
   impacts of cities on soils and their implications for restoration
   planning and expectations of restoration ``success.{''} Urban soils
   exist in different historical and formational trajectories than their
   local nonurbanized counterparts due to direct anthropogenic disturbance
   and indirect environmental impacts from urbanization. Therefore, urban
   soils often exhibit altered physical, chemical, and biological
   characteristics in comparison to local nonurbanized soils. Several
   unique features of urban soils and urban ecosystems pose particular
   issues for ecological restoration or the improvement of degraded soil
   conditions in cities. The creation of novel soil types, conditions that
   promote invasion by non-natives, the strong influence of past land use
   on soil properties, and the presence of strong interactions and
   alternative stable states set up unique difficulties for the restoration
   of urban soils. Soils in urban restorations are a medium that can be
   deliberately manipulated to improve site conditions or in the monitoring
   of soil conditions as indices of ecosystem status. Including an explicit
   role for strong manipulations of soils in urban ecosystems changes how
   we approach baselines, management, and reference conditions in urban
   ecological restoration. With an understanding of urban soil ecological
   knowledge, we can guide aspects of urban ecological restoration toward
   successful outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Declines in avian populations are often attributed to the presence of
   introduced predators but conservation managers frequently lack good
   information about the effectiveness of potential predator control
   regimes for protecting threatened species. Whio, Hymenolaimus
   malacorhynchos, are a threatened New Zealand waterfowl that has been
   declining in both distribution and abundance. We conducted a six-year
   study using a paired-catchment experiment in New Zealand Nothofagus
   forest as part of an adaptive management programme to assess whether
   whio populations responded positively to stoat (Mustela erminea)
   control. Video monitoring identified stoats as the primary nest
   predator. Year-round low-intensity stoat control (10 traps per linear
   km) significantly reduced the stoat abundance index in trapped sites
   compared with untrapped sites. As a result, whio nesting success and
   productivity, the number of fledglings produced per pair, increased
   significantly in the trapped compared to the untrapped area. However,
   survival rates and the number of pairs did not change significantly
   between the treatments. These findings indicate stoats are the primary
   agent of decline for whio in this Nothofagus forest system, and show
   that low-intensity stoat control is sufficient to improve the
   productivity of whio populations. Overall, the study demonstrates the
   value of an adaptive management approach whereby management techniques
   can be evaluated to ensure that the primary agent of decline is clearly
   identified and that predator densities are kept sufficiently low. (c)

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aim The large biogenic structures formed by colonial cold-water
   scleractinian corals provide valuable habitat for marine invertebrates
   on seamounts and the continental slope of all world oceans. These
   patchily distributed long-lived structures are easily damaged by several
   human activities, particularly bottom trawling for fish, and are
   potentially vulnerable to ocean acidification caused by climate change.
   Consequently, an important conservation question is whether these
   structures support a specialized invertebrate fauna restricted to these
   habitats. Here we investigate the relationship between structures formed
   by the coral Solenosmilia variabilis and its associated ophiuroid
   (brittlestar) fauna, one of the dominant components of deep-sea
   ecosystems.
   Location Seafloor habitat around Southern Australia, New Zealand, and
   the Macquarie Ridge from 35 to 53 degrees S and 117 degrees E-176
   degrees W, 500-1500 m depth.
   Methods Data were derived from samples collected by numerous scientific
   expeditions to the study region. Because these samples were collected
   using a variety of gear and effort, a two-step approach was used. First,
   the largest consistently collected data set (73 ophiuroid species from
   59 samples) was assembled for multivariate analysis. ANOSIM was used to
   test for differences in ophiuroid community composition between
   Solenosmilia and non-Solenosmilia habitat on seamounts and the
   continental slope, and SIMPER was used to identify species that
   characterized Solenosmilia habitat. Second, these results were validated
   against all known data to ensure that these characteristic species had
   not been found in non-Solenosmilia habitat elsewhere.
   Results The ophiuroid assemblages from Solenosmilia habitat were
   distinct from those found on other habitats on the continental slope and
   offshore seamounts across the study region. Although a suite of
   ophiuroid species characterized Solenosmilia habitat, most have also
   been collected from dead coral or other rubble, suggesting a physical
   rather than biological association between the coral matrix and its
   associated invertebrate fauna.
   Main conclusions Despite the lack of an exclusive ophiuroid-coral
   relationship, cold-water scleractinian coral remains the principal
   habitat for a number of ophiuroid species across southern Australia and
   New Zealand. The slow growth rate of the coral and the low dispersal
   potential of some associated species suggest that recovery of damaged
   cold-water coral assemblages will be a long-term process.}},

Abstract = {{Alimentary carbohydrate overload is a significant cause of laminitis in
   horses and is correlated with drastic shifts in the composition of
   hindgut microbiota. Equine hindgut streptococcal species (EHSS),
   predominantly Streptococcus lutetiensis, have been shown to be the most
   common microorganisms culturable from the equine caecum prior to the
   onset of laminitis. However, the inherent biases of culture-based
   methods are estimated to preclude up to 70\% of the normal caecal
   microbiota. The objective of this study was to evaluate bacterial
   population shifts occurring in the equine caecum throughout the course
   of oligofructose-induced laminitis using several culture-independent
   techniques and to correlate these with caecal lactate, volatile fatty
   acid and degrees of polymerization 3-7 fructo-oligosaccharide
   concentrations. Our data conclusively show that of the total microbiota
   present in the equine hindgut, the EHSS S. lutetiensis is the
   predominant microorganism that proliferates prior to the onset of
   laminitis, utilizing oligofructose to produce large quantities of
   lactate. Population shifts in lactobacilli and Escherichia coli
   subpopulations occur secondarily to the EHSS population shifts, thus
   confirming that lactobacilli and coliforms have no role in laminitis. A
   large, curved, Gram-negative rod previously observed during the early
   phases of laminitis induction was most closely related to the
   Anaerovibrio genus and most likely represents a new, yet to be cultured,
   genus and species. Correlation of fluorescence in situ hybridization and
   quantitative real-time PCR results provide evidence supporting the
   hypothesis that laminitis is associated with the death en masse and
   rapid cell lysis of EHSS. If EHSS are lysed, liberated cellular
   components may initiate laminitis.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the spread of invasive species is a challenge for modern
   ecology. Although many invasive species undergo genetic bottlenecks
   during introduction to new areas resulting in a loss of genetic
   diversity, successful invaders manage to flourish in novel environments
   either because of pre-adaptations or because important traits contain
   adaptive variation enabling rapid adaptation to changing conditions. To
   predict and understand invasion success, it is crucial to analyse these
   features. We assessed the potential of a well-known invader, the
   Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), to expand north of
   its current range in Europe. A short growing season and harsh
   overwintering conditions are apparent limiting factors for this species'
   range. By rearing full-sib families from four geographically distinct
   populations (Russia, Estonia, Poland, Italy) at two fluctuating
   temperature regimes, we investigated (a) possible differences in
   survival, development time, and body size among populations and (b) the
   amount of adaptive variation within populations in these traits. All
   populations were able to complete their development in cooler conditions
   than in their current range. A significant genotype-environment
   interaction for development time and body size suggests the presence of
   adaptive genetic variation, indicating potential to adapt to cooler
   conditions. The northernmost population had the highest survival rates
   and fastest development times on both temperature regimes, suggesting
   pre-adaptation to cooler temperatures. Other populations had minor
   differences in development times. Interestingly, this species lacks the
   classical trade-off between body size and development time which could
   have contributed to its invasion potential. This study demonstrates the
   importance of considering both ecological and evolutionary aspects when
   assessing invasion risk.}},

Abstract = {{As changes in climate become more apparent, ecologists face the
   challenge of predicting species responses to the new conditions. Most
   forecasts are based on climate envelopes (CE), correlative approaches
   that project future distributions on the basis of the current climate
   often assuming some dispersal lag. One major caveat with this approach
   is that it ignores the complexity of factors other than climate that
   contribute to a species' distributional range. To overcome this
   limitation and to complement predictions based on CE modeling we carried
   out a transplant experiment of resident and potential-migrant species.
   Tree seedlings of 18 species were planted side by side from 2001 to 2004
   at several locations in the Southern Appalachians and in the North
   Carolina Piedmont (USA). Growing seedlings under a large array of
   environmental conditions, including those forecasted for the next
   decades, allowed us to model seedling survival as a function of
   variables characteristic of each site, and from here we were able to
   make predictions on future seedling recruitment. In general, almost all
   species showed decreased survival in plots and years with lower soil
   moisture, including both residents and potential migrants, and in both
   locations, the Southern Appalachians and the Piedmont. The detrimental
   effects that anticipated arid conditions could have on seedling
   recruitment contradict some of the projections made by CE modeling,
   where many of the species tested are expected to increase in abundance
   or to expand their ranges. These results point out the importance of
   evaluating the potential sources of migrant species when modeling
   vegetation response to climate change, and considering that species
   adapted to the new climate and the local conditions may not be available

Abstract = {{1. Nature conservation and restoration traditionally focus on protecting
   individual sites. In parts of the world where the natural landscape has
   been severely altered for agricultural or urban use, individual patches
   are too small and isolated to ensure effective nature protection.
   Spatial processes, such as metapopulation dynamics, are disrupted and
   natural linkages in the landscape, such as water flows, are severed by
   modifications in the landscape and hydrology.
   2. We propose the identification of Operational Landscape Units (OLUs),
   which are defined as combinations of landscape patches with their
   hydrogeological and biotic connections, as a tool to facilitate wetland
   restoration in catchments with a high degree of fragmentation and
   strongly altered hydrology. The combined consideration of biotic (i.e.
   dispersal, transports of organisms) and hydrological connections
   (flooding events, groundwater flowpaths) is a new approach.
   3. We developed criteria for the delineation of OLUs in regional wetland
   restoration initiatives. The key elements for delineation are definition
   of the restoration objectives, identification of spatial landscape
   mechanisms and information on historic and present land uses and
   hydrologic management.
   4. As a case study, we delineated an OLU by applying these criteria in a
   restoration initiative for a large agricultural area that used to be a
   floodplain until the early 1950s in N.E. Twente, The Netherlands. The
   OLU encompassed not only the floodplain area to be restored but also a
   relatively remote nature reserve upstream as well as the stream
   connecting both areas. By restoring the historic water regime, flooding
   events would become a regular feature in the two areas and organisms
   including seeds would flow from the nature reserve to the restored
   floodplain.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Discussions of the proposed Operational
   Landscape Units with stakeholders (water authorities, nature
   conservation agencies, farmers) resulted in shared insights which will
   lead to modifications of the original management plan for the area. We
   believe the OLU approach will make natural resource managers aware of
   the importance of spatial processes and connectivity in landscapes and..
   if properly applied, will lead to more natural and more successful
   restoration projects.}},

Title = {{A parsimonious combination of functional traits predicting plant
   response to disturbance and soil fertility}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Questions: 1. How many traits associated with persistence and
   regeneration are necessary to predict the response of plants to soil
   fertility and disturbance? 2. Are correlated changes in trait
   expressions linked to the response of functional groups to fertility and
   disturbance?
   Location: Lower Frankonia, Germany.
   Methods: On 120 plots located in managed and abandoned grasslands,
   fields, and vineyards, we recorded species composition, disturbance
   intensity, soil water and nutrients, and ten candidate traits for 75
   species. We used a novel method which is based on three steps: (1)
   logistic regression to separate responsive from non-responsive species;
   (2) iterative clustering of all possible combinations of the candidate
   traits including regression of each cluster in response to the
   environmental variables; ( 3) selection of the trait combination that
   performed best with respect to goodness of fit of all clusters from this
   combination. Bivariate trait relationships across functional groups were
   analysed with reduced major axis regression (RMA).
   Results: The parsimonious trait combination consisted of life span,
   specific leaf area (SLA), canopy height, and seed number. The
   `acquisitive' functional groups in terms of SLA and height were linked
   to higher fertility and earlier disturbance, while the `retentive'
   groups related to lower fertility and later disturbance. Investment in
   reproduction, however, displayed a reverse relation. SLA and canopy
   height showed correlated shifts in two pairs of co-occurring functional
   groups.
   Conclusions: A small number of traits is sufficient to predict the
   response of species. Plants need a higher increment in SLA to reach the
   same height, if start of disturbance is earlier. Linkages between traits
   shift from generative to vegetative with increasing fertility and
   earlier start of disturbance. Functional groups enable shifts in scaling
   relationships between traits to be analysed, in contrast to the analysis
   of single traits.}},

Abstract = {{A wide range of modelling algorithms is used by ecologists, conservation
   practitioners, and others to predict species ranges from point locality
   data. Unfortunately, the amount of data available is limited for many
   taxa and regions, making it essential to quantify the sensitivity of
   these algorithms to sample size. This is the first study to address this
   need by rigorously evaluating a broad suite of algorithms with
   independent presence-absence data from multiple species and regions. We
   evaluated predictions from 12 algorithms for 46 species (from six
   different regions of the world) at three sample sizes (100, 30, and 10
   records). We used data from natural history collections to run the
   models, and evaluated the quality of model predictions with area under
   the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). With decreasing
   sample size, model accuracy decreased and variability increased across
   species and between models. Novel modelling methods that incorporate
   both interactions between predictor variables and complex response
   shapes (i.e. GBM, MARS-INT, BRUTO) performed better than most methods at
   large sample sizes but not at the smallest sample sizes. Other
   algorithms were much less sensitive to sample size, including an
   algorithm based on maximum entropy (MAXENT) that had among the best
   predictive power across all sample sizes. Relative to other algorithms,
   a distance metric algorithm (DOMAIN) and a genetic algorithm (OM-GARP)
   had intermediate performance at the largest sample size and among the
   best performance at the lowest sample size. No algorithm predicted
   consistently well with small sample size (n < 30) and this should
   encourage highly conservative use of predictions based on small sample
   size and restrict their use to exploratory modelling.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Rapid biological assessment (RBA) methods involving non-quantitative
   sampling of aquatic macroinvertebrates, sub-sampling of only a
   proportion of the organisms collected, and identification only to
   genus-level were used to assess responses over up to 7 years following
   the cessation of discharges from five sewage treatment plants into small
   streams in the Blue Mountains, Australia, and an increased volume of
   discharge into another stream. Multivariate analysis (ordination and
   analysis of similarities) did not always show an obvious recovery after
   discharge cessation: assemblages sampled upstream and downstream of
   discharge points were not always clearly closer in ordination space
   after cessation than before and statistically significant differences
   between upstream and downstream assemblages generally remained after
   cessation, apparently because of natural medium-scale spatial
   variability. However, the tolerance-based SIGNAL-SG biotic index
   demonstrated some recovery in all cases of discharge cessation, and a
   lag in recovery of about a year. A lesser recovery in the more urbanised
   catchments was attributed to persistent pollution from sources other
   than treatment plant discharges. The biotic index also revealed subtle
   biological change that was not predictable from monitoring data on
   nutrient concentrations. The SIGNAL-SG biotic index derived from RBA
   sampling provides an easily communicated measure of the effectiveness of
   investment in abatement of sewage impacts on stream macroinvertebrates

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new way of using forward selection of explanatory
   variables in regression or canonical redundancy analysis. The classical
   forward selection method presents two problems: a highly inflated Type I
   error and an overestimation of the amount of explained variance.
   Correcting these problems will greatly improve the performance of this
   very useful method in ecological modeling. To prevent the first problem,
   we propose a two-step procedure. First, a global test using all
   explanatory variables is carried out. If, and only if, the global test
   is significant, one can proceed with forward selection. To prevent
   overestimation of the explained variance, the forward selection has to
   be carried out with two stopping criteria: (1) the usual alpha
   significance level and (2) the adjusted coefficient of multiple
   determination (R(a)(2)) calculated using all explanatory variables. When
   forward selection identifies a variable that brings one or the other
   criterion over the fixed threshold, that variable is rejected, and the
   procedure is stopped. This improved method is validated by simulations
   involving univariate and multivariate response data. An ecological
   example is presented using data from the Bryce Canyon National Park,

Abstract = {{Aim Using a new approach to analyse fossil pollen data, we investigate

   Location North America.
   Methods We extracted data on the timing and magnitude of the maximum
   value of Populus pollen from each pollen diagram in the North American
   Pollen Database (NAPD). The information was plotted in histograms of
   150-year bins to identify times when Populus was abundant on the
   landscape. We also mapped the maximum values to identify spatial
   patterns and their causes.
   Results Our analyses show that there have been several periods since the
   Late Glacial when Populus was abundant on the landscape: (1) from 12.35
   to 12.65 kyr BP, in eastern North America, largely in response to the
   opening of the forest following the onset of the Younger Dryas; (2) from
   10.85 to 11.75 kyr BP, following the termination of the Younger Dryas;
   and (3) during the last 150 years, as land was cleared for agricultural
   use, especially in the midwestern United States.
   Main conclusion Since the Late Glacial, changes in the abundance of

Abstract = {{Aim This study aims to assess the role of long-distance seed dispersal

   understand whether this explains the relatively higher northern
   diversity found in eastern North American tree species compared with
   that in Europe.
   Location North-eastern United States.
   Methods The distribution of intraspecific cpDNA variation in temperate
   tree populations has been used to identify aspects of post-glacial
   population spread, including topographic barriers to population
   expansion and spread by long-distance seed dispersal. We sequenced c.
   370 cpDNA base pairs from 221 individuals in 100 populations throughout
   the north-eastern United States, and analysed spatial patterns of
   diversity and differentiation.
   Results Red maple has high genetic diversity near its northern range
   limit, but this diversity is not partitioned by topographic barriers,
   suggesting that the northern Appalachian Mountains were not a barrier to
   the colonization of red maple. We also found no evidence of the patchy
   genetic structure that has been associated with spread by rare
   long-distance seed dispersal in previous studies.
   Main conclusions Constraints on post-glacial colonization in eastern
   North America seem to have been less stringent than those in northern
   Europe, where bottlenecks arising from long-distance colonization and
   topographic barriers appear to have strongly reduced genetic diversity.
   In eastern North America, high northern genetic diversity may have been
   maintained by a combination of frequent long-distance dispersal, minor
   topographic obstacles and diffuse northern refugia near the ice sheet.}},

Title = {{Gap-phase dynamics and coexistence of a long-lived pioneer and

   temperate rain forest of Chiloe Island, Chile}},

Abstract = {{Aim A major question with regard to the ecology of temperate rain
   forests in south-central Chile is how pioneer and shade-tolerant tree
   species coexist in old-growth forests. We explored the correspondence
   between tree regeneration dynamics and life-history traits to explain
   the coexistence of these two functional types in stands apparently
   representing a non-equilibrium mixture.
   Location This study was conducted in northern Chiloe Island, Chile (41.6
   degrees S, 73.9 degrees W) in a temperate coastal rain forest with no
   evidence of stand disruption by human impact.
   Methods We assessed stand structure by sampling all stems within two 50
   x 20 m and four 5 x 100 m plots. A 600-m long transect, with 20
   uniformly spaced sampling points, was used to quantify seedling and
   sapling densities, obtain increment cores, and randomly select 10
   tree-fall gaps. We used tree-ring analysis to assess establishment
   periods and to relate the influences of disturbances to the regeneration
   dynamics of the main canopy species.
   Results Canopy emergent tree species were the long-lived pioneer
   Eucryphia cordifolia and the shade-tolerant Aextoxicon punctatum.
   Shade-tolerant species such as Laureliopsis philippiana and several
   species of Myrtaceae occupied the main canopy. The stem diameter
   distribution for E. cordifolia was distinctly unimodal, while for A.
   punctatum it was multi-modal, with all age classes represented.
   Myrtaceae accounted for most of the small trees. Most tree seedlings and
   saplings occurred beneath canopy gaps. Based on tree-ring counts, the
   largest individuals of A. punctatum and E. cordifolia had minimum ages
   estimated to be > 350 years and > 286 years, respectively.
   Shade-tolerant Myrtaceae species and L. philippiana had shorter life
   spans (< 200 years). Most growth releases, regardless of tree species,
   were moderate and have occurred continuously since 1750.
   Main conclusions We suggest that this coastal forest has remained
   largely free of stand-disrupting disturbances for at least 450 years,
   without substantial changes in canopy composition. Release patterns are
   consistent with this hypothesis and suggest that the disturbance regime
   is dominated by individual tree-fall gaps, with sporadic multiple tree
   falls. Long life spans, maximum height and differences in shade
   tolerance provide a basis for understanding the long-term coexistence of
   pioneer and shade-tolerant tree species in this coastal, old-growth rain
   forest, despite the rarity of major disturbances.}},
