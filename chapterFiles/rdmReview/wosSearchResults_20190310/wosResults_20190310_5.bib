Abstract = {{Aims Both human and non-human determinants have shaped Mediterranean
   forest structure over the last few millennia. The effects of recent
   human activities on forest composition, however, remain poorly
   understood. We quantified changes in forest composition during the past
   century in the mixed forests of Quercus suber (cork oak) and Q.
   canariensis (Algerian oak), and explored the effects of forest
   management and environmental (climate, topography) factors on forest
   structure at various spatial and temporal scales.
   Location Mountains north of the Strait of Gibraltar (southern Spain).
   Methods First, we quantified 20th-century changes in species composition
   from a series of inventories in nine mixed forests (c. 40,000 ha), and
   examined them in terms of the management practices and environmental
   conditions. Second, we analysed present-day Q. suber and Q. canariensis
   stand structure along environmental gradients at two spatial scales: (1)
   that of the forest landscape (c. 284 ha), combining local inventories
   and topographic variables and using a digital elevation model; and (2)
   regional (c. 87,600 km(2)), combining data from the Spanish Forest
   Inventory for the Andalusia region and estimates of climatic variables.
   Results Historical data indicate anthropogenic changes in stand
   composition, revealing a sharp increase in the density of cork oaks over
   the last century. Forest management has favoured this species (for cork
   production) at the expense of Q. canariensis. The impact of management
   is imprinted on the present-day forest structure. The abundance of both
   species increases with annual mean precipitation, and they coexist above
   800 mm (the minimum threshold for Q. canariensis). Quercus suber
   dominates in most of the stands, and species segregation in the
   landscape is associated with the drainage network, Q. canariensis being
   clearly associated with moister habitats near streams.
   Main conclusions Our study quantitatively exemplifies a recent
   human-mediated shift in forest composition. As a result of forest
   management, the realized niche of the cork oak has been enlarged at the
   expense of that of Q. canariensis, providing further evidence for humans
   as major drivers of oak forest composition across the Mediterranean.
   Recent regeneration problems detected in Q. suber stands, a reduced
   demand for wood products, conservation policies, and climate change
   augur new large-scale shifts in forest composition.}},

Abstract = {{River health monitoring traditionally has made use of structural
   measurements (water quality or taxonomic composition of aquatic
   organisms). We argue that a more complete assessment of river health
   should include functional metrics, such as rates of organic matter
   decomposition and ecosystem metabolism. Leaf breakdown links the
   characteristics of riparian vegetation with the activity of both aquatic
   invertebrates and microbial organisms and is affected by natural and
   human-induced variation in a wide range of environmental factors.
   Measurement of leaf breakdown is relatively simple and has modest
   equipment requirements. River metabolism (gross primary productivity and
   ecosystem respiration) measures the rates of production and use of
   organic C in river ecosystems as a whole, providing a direct estimate of
   the food base that determines life-supporting capacity. Metabolism
   measurements require more sophisticated equipment than do measurements
   of leaf breakdown, but improvements in technology have made metabolism
   measurements relatively easy. We review the factors that influence leaf
   breakdown and river metabolism and pay particular attention to the
   effects of human-induced environmental stressors. We also describe how
   measurements can be standardized and suggest criteria for interpreting
   functional measures in terms of river ecosystem health. Last, we
   consider the strengths and weaknesses of both methods as functional
   measures and provide recommendations for their use as biomonitoring
   tools.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge on below-ground plant distributions is almost lacking to date,
   despite the fact that such information would be very valuable in
   understanding below-ground competition and species-specific
   interactions, processes that are expected to shape community structure.
   Methods available so far for below-ground species determination have
   drawbacks that we tried to challenge. Some methods make use of
   differences in the chemical composition between species, but this is
   highly variable upon environmental factors. DNA-based techniques - far
   less dependent on chemical composition - such as polymerase chain
   reaction on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers can so far only
   determine presence-absence of a species in a mixed root sample. Here, we
   present a quantitative DNA-based technique that allows investigation of
   relative species abundances in experimental mixed root samples. We used
   quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on
   species-specific markers obtained from intersimple sequence repeat
   (ISSR) analyses in root samples. This molecular technique is novel in
   the field of root ecology and its development overcame three challenges:
   (i) determination of species-specific DNA fragments, (ii) development
   and optimization of the real time PCR protocol, (iii) designing a data
   treatment method based on a modified delta-delta-cycle threshold (CT)
   analysis. The method gained robustness from using relative DNA
   abundances in species mixtures rather than absolute concentration
   readings. This requires accurate multispecies reference series as a
   calibration. Test samples with different known biomass ratios of all
   species showed proof of concept of this method. The pro's and contra's
   of this method are discussed in the light of its contribution to
   advancing ecological research on below-ground plant-plant interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Over 6.110 ha of the commercial production salt ponds surrounding South
   San Francisco Bay, CA, have been decommissioned and reconnected to the
   bay, most as part of the largest wetlands restoration program in the
   western United States. These open water ponds are critical habitat for
   millions of birds annually and restoration program managers must
   determine the appropriate balance between retention of ponds versus
   re-conversion to tidal salt marsh, knowing that both are essential
   ecosystems for endangered bird species. Our study describes the
   ecological value of the new open water pond ecosystems as feeding
   habitats for birds. We used the oxygen rate of change method to
   determine ecosystem metabolic parameters from high resolution
   time-series of dissolved oxygen concentration. Areal gross primary
   production (8.17 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) was roughly double the world's most
   productive estuaries. High rates of phytoplankton photosynthesis were
   balanced by equally high rates of community respiration (8.25 g O-2
   m(-2) d(-1)). Metabolic equilibrium was delicately poised; sharp
   irradiance and temperature shifts triggered short term photosynthesis
   reduction resulting in oxygen depletion. We converted net primary
   production (NPP) into potential carrying capacity of the forage biota
   that support targeted pond waterbirds. NPP was processed through both a
   pelagic food web, resulting in forage biota for piscivorous birds and a
   benthic food web, resulting in forage biota for shorebirds and diving
   benthivores. Both food webs included efficient algal-based and
   inefficient detrital trophic pathways. The result of all primary
   production being routed through simple food webs was high potential
   forage production and energy supply to waterbirds, equivalent to 11-163
   million planktivorous fish or 19-78 billion small estuarine clams within
   the 330-ha pond between May and October. food quantity does not
   necessarily equal quality and these systems have the potential to
   produce toxic or inedible algae. Our study provides the first
   measurement of primary production in the open water ponds of San
   Francisco Bay and presents a novel approach for transforming primary
   production into forage production as a metric of an ecosystem's
   energetic carrying capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Senecio aquaticus is an esteemed wetland species. but it is
   also a poisonous species in grasslands for forage production of various
   countries (e.g. Great Britain and Central European states), and its
   further spread onto farmland must be prevented. To reveal links between
   management practice and the occurrence of S. aquaticus, a survey was
   carried out on agricultural grassland in the summer of 2005.
   Location: The Mountain region in the northern and central part of
   Switzerland.
   Methods: Botanical assessments were carried out on management units
   (parcels) where S. aquaticus occurred and on neighbouring parcels
   without occurrence. For all parcels, we analysed the soil nutrients and
   the details of management such as intensity of fertilisation and
   defoliation frequency.
   Results: There was a high risk of S. aquaticus occurrence in parcels
   with low nitrogen fertilisation, a change of management intensity in the
   preceding 15 years, high inclination, and gaps in the sward. The change
   in the vegetation composition caused by altering the management
   intensity most probably provided gaps in the sward. which were then
   colonised by S. aquaticus. A novel finding is that. despite its
   preference for low-nutrient sites. the species was also persistent at
   sites with a moderate to high management intensity.
   Conclusion: A long-term control of S. aquaticus on agricultural
   grasslands can best be achieved by avoiding sward damage and by
   promoting dense and stable swards. The management should be adjusted to
   the local environmental conditions and the requirements of the
   favourable plant species. This could prevent the spread of S. aquaticus
   from the protected wetlands onto agricultural grasslands, where the
   species would threaten animal health.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{852-866}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Introduced species often exhibit changes in genetic variation,
   population structure, selection regime and phenotypic traits as they
   colonize and expand into new ranges. For these reasons, species
   invasions are increasingly recognized as promising systems for studying
   adaptive evolution over contemporary time scales. However, changes in
   phenotypic traits during invasion occur under non-equilibrium
   demographic conditions and may reflect the influences of prior
   evolutionary history and chance events, as well as selection. We briefly
   review the evidence for phenotypic evolution and the role of selection
   during invasion. While there is ample evidence for evolutionary change,
   it is less clear if selection is the primary mechanism. We then discuss
   the likelihood that stochastic events shift phenotypic distributions
   during invasion, and argue that hypotheses of adaptation should be
   tested against appropriate null models. We suggest two experimental
   frameworks for separating stochastic evolution from adaptation:
   statistically accounting for phenotypic variation among putative
   invasion sources identified by using phylogenetic or assignment methods
   and by comparing estimates of differentiation within and among ranges
   for both traits and neutral markers (Q(ST) vs. F-ST). Designs that
   incorporate a null expectation can reveal the role of history and chance
   in the evolutionary process, and provide greater insights into evolution

Abstract = {{A new ecosystem model - the Ecological Connectivity Hypoxia Model
   (ECOHYM) - was developed and applied to Tokyo Bay, a hypoxic estuary in
   Japan. ECOHYM permits study of the dynamics and mechanisms of hypoxia
   from two perspectives: (1) the whole estuary, composed of
   temporal-spatial mutual linkage of benthic-pelagic or central bay-tidal
   flat ecosystems (holistic approach), and (2) each biochemical and
   physical process, contributing to oxygen production/consumption
   (elemental approach). ECOHYM evaluates the
   oxygen-carbon-nitrogen-phosphorus-coupled cycle driven by physical and
   biochemical processes. The Processes mechanically describe the ecosystem
   network consisting of benthic-pelagic and central bay-tidal flat
   ecosystem coupling. The model also describes the early diagenetic
   processes of the benthic ecosystems by setting a micro-scale vertical
   spatial resolution due to the drastic vertical change of benthic
   biological metabolism and its high contribution to total oxygen
   consumption. Model variables were mainly selected based on low trophic
   level; namely, phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus, dissolved organic
   matter, NH4-N, NO3-N, PO4-P, benthic algae, suspension feeders, deposit
   feeders (benthic faunas), dissolved oxygen (DO) and oxygen demand units
   (ODU, representing the stoichiometric expression of Mn2+, Fe2+ and S2-
   oxygen demand). Detritus was divided into fast-labile, slow-labile and
   refractory parts. Bacterial mineralization processes were divided into
   oxic, suboxic and anoxic fractions. The model was applied for a time
   frame of 100 years under seasonal forcing functions to achieve an annual
   periodical steady state. The model results revealed that the seasonal
   dynamics were more noticeable than the daily/tidal dynamics in the
   central bay area. In contrast, the daily/tidal dynamics were determinant
   in the tidal flat area. Calculated seasonal dynamics in the central bay
   and daily/tidal dynamics in the tidal flat were in good agreement with
   the observed data. In particular, the model succeeded in reproducing the
   following vertical DO profiles during the hypoxic season (summer): (1)
   high oxygen at the sea-surface and hypoxia at the sea-bottom in the
   central bay area, (2) the reduced thickness of the benthic oxic layer in
   the central bay area, and (3) the drastic change of DO micro-profiles
   between daytime and nighttime of the benthic system in the tidal flat
   areas. Oxygen fluxes at the sediment-water interface in the model also
   reproduced the in situ observed values both in the central bay and tidal
   flat areas. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reasonable zoning of the nature reserve (NR) is the key to maintain the
   reserve's ecological functions for sustainable development. Many zoning
   designs in the past years were too subjective and lack of scientific
   contents. The aim of this paper is to find the new approaches for NRs'
   functional zoning. We firstly analyzed the practical problems occurred
   in the functional zoning of giant panda NRs in China. Secondly, a
   reasonable index system to guide zoning was established for the case
   study area-Laoxiancheng NR. Finally two new zoning approaches were
   developed, which were all automatic realization methods based on spatial
   analysis using GIS.
   The habitat suitability assessment (HSA)-based approach considered both
   natural landscape factors and human disturbing factors. It integrated
   the outputs of landscape suitability assessment and human disturbance
   assessment with overlaying the trail density of giant pandas. The HSA
   zoning showed that (1) 72.2\% trail locations of giant panda lied within
   the core zone, while all human settlements were sited inside the
   experimental zone; (2) the core zone contained 82.3\% suitable habitat
   patches, while the experimental zone defined 82\% human disturbed areas.
   The least-cost distance calculation (LCDC)-based approach described the
   degrees of species conservation and of landscape resistance on species.
   The animal's selective movement process could be reflected by the
   spatial variation of the least-cost distance. we classified the
   least-cost distance using the standard deviation and obtained three
   thresholds for the core, buffer and experimental zones of Laoxiancheng
   NR. The LCDC zoning showed that (1) the selection of three thresholds
   for functional zoning was the key step of this approach; (2) the
   different safety-level zonings can be designed by utilizing the
   classification of standard deviation; and the used medium safety-level
   zoning produced the core, buffer and experimental zones with the areas
   of 77.37, 22.51 and 25.25 km(2), respectively.
   Two zoning results demonstrated that two approaches will be useful for
   species conservation and NR management and can be applied and extended
   to the relevant nature reserves which aim at the preservation of the
   endangered species and their habitats. They make it possible to avoid
   the subjective and non-scientific zoning. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Estimating historic distributions of species is a critical step in
   evaluating current levels of habitat loss, evaluating sites for
   potential restoration and reintroductions, and for conservation planning
   at a landscape scale. However historic distributions can be difficult to
   estimate objectively because substantial habitat changes may have
   occurred prior to comprehensive surveys. As a means to address this
   question, we evaluated a novel approach by creating spatial niche models
   for two species of psammophilic lizards. Using a partitioned Mahalanobis
   D-2 analysis and abiotic variables that were independent of
   anthropogenic change, we created niche models for the federally
   threatened Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard (Uma inornata) and for
   the flat-tailed horned lizard (Phrynosoma mcallii). The niche models
   estimated that within the Coachella Valley there were originally 32,164
   ha of potential habitat for the fringe-toed lizard and 33,502 ha of
   potential habitat for the horned lizard. After screening these estimates
   of historic habitat for current conditions that would render that
   potential habitat unsuitable, we calculated a 91-95\% loss of potential
   habitat for the fringe-toed lizard and an 83-92\% loss for the horned
   lizard. Unlike the fringe-toed lizard, the horned lizard also occurs
   outside the Coachella Valley. Conducting a similar analysis throughout
   its range would provide an objective estimate of the total habitat loss
   experienced by this species. This information could be used to address
   whether granting it federal or state protection is warranted. For
   species whose distributions can be modeled with abiotic variables such
   as soils, elevation, topography, and climate, this approach may have
   broad applications for resolving questions regarding their current
   levels of habitat loss and regional conservation planning. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{Aim We examine issues of uncertainty regarding the spatial and temporal

   Location Europe.
   Methods A new data base was compiled from national phenological
   observations covering 15 European countries, with the longest
   observational periods exceeding several decades for some sites. From
   this, the spatial and temporal representativeness of phenological
   observations were evaluated via statistical analysis.
   Results The results showed that there was a significant and irreducible
   uncertainty related to the use of data of a single station, which varied
   from 3 to 8 days depending on the station location. In more continental
   and northern climatic zones the uncertainty was lower, probably due to
   faster spring-time weather developments. In mild climatic conditions,
   the uncertainty of dates of the phenological phases registered by a
   single station exceeded 1 week. The considerable number of data allowed
   us to preliminarily estimate the features of some stations, marking them
   as `late', `early', `representative' or `random', depending on the dates
   reported by these sites and the corresponding regional means.
   Main conclusions The uncertainties discovered in single-site
   phenological observations are significant for virtually any potential
   application. Possible approaches for handling the uncertainty problem
   are station pre-averaging and spatial regularization of the data set,

Abstract = {{1. The evolution of flowering strategies (when and at what size to
   flower) in monocarpic perennials is determined by balancing current
   reproduction with expected future reproduction, and these are largely
   determined by size-specific patterns of growth and survival. However,
   because of the difficulty in following long-lived individuals throughout
   their lives, this theory has largely been tested using short-lived
   species (< 5 years).
   2. Here, we tested this theory using the long-lived monocarpic perennial
   Campanula thyrsoides which can live up to 16 years. We used a novel
   approach that combined permanent plot and herb chronology data from a
   3-year field study to parameterize and validate integral projection
   models (IPMs).
   3. Similar to other monocarpic species, the rosette leaves of C.
   thyrsoides wither over winter and so size cannot be measured in the year
   of flowering. We therefore extended the existing IPM framework to
   incorporate an additional time delay that arises because flowering
   demography must be predicted from rosette size in the year before
   flowering.
   4. We found that all main demographic functions (growth, survival
   probability, flowering probability and fecundity) were strongly
   size-dependent and there was a pronounced threshold size of flowering.
   There was good agreement between the predicted distribution of flowering
   ages obtained from the IPMs and that estimated in the field. Mostly,
   there was good agreement between the IPM predictions and the direct
   quantitative field measurements regarding the demographic parameters
   lambda, R-0 and T. We therefore conclude that the model captures the
   main demographic features of the field populations.
   5. Elasticity analysis indicated that changes in the survival and growth
   function had the largest effect (c. 80\%) on lambda and this was
   considerably larger than in short-lived monocarps. We found only weak
   selection pressure operating on the observed flowering strategy which
   was close to the predicted evolutionary stable strategy.
   6. Synthesis. The extended IPM accurately described the demography of a
   long-lived monocarpic perennial using data collected over a relatively
   short period. We could show that the evolution of flowering strategies
   in short- and long-lived monocarps seem to follow the same general rules
   but with a longevity-related emphasis on survival over fecundity.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, studies on polar bear (Ursus maritimus) movements and
   space use have used data collected by satellite telemetry collars that
   provided positions infrequently (typically weekly) and with low
   precision (by Doppler Shift method). A new generation of transmitters
   incorporated into collars use the Global Positioning System (GPS) to
   provide highly accurate positions, and have the ability to provide many
   positions per day. We used data from two GPS collars fitted to female
   polar bears, that attempted to collect six positions per day (4-h apart)
   for 546 days (from April 2000 to September 2001) and 413 days (from
   April 2000 to May 2001) to estimate how estimated speed of movement and
   home range size increase with increasing number of data points. Using
   all the positions, we estimated that the bears moved a minimum of 14.3
   and 15.8 km per day on average. The fractal dimension (D) of the
   movement pathways for the two bears were D = 1.28 and 1.31,
   respectively, indicating low tortousity of the movements. Their minimum
   estimated annual home range areas were 20,794 and 112,183 km(2).
   Simulations showed that a commonly used sampling regime of one location
   every 6th day would have significantly underestimated the movement rates
   and the home range sizes compared to our estimates. We also used the
   high accuracy of GPS positions to look at distances moved within 4-h
   periods. Maximum movement rate during a 4-h period for the two bears was
   4.21 and 4.58 km/h, respectively. Variation in median values by month
   was significant (0.01 km/h in November for N23476 to 1.48 km/h in
   December for N7955). Diurnal variation was observed to differ between
   defined periods.}},

Abstract = {{Although Indonesia has no shortage of land area that lost its forest
   cover before 1990 and has become the global leader in land-use based
   greenhouse gas emissions, the widespread expectation that the
   afforestation/reforestation approach to Clean Development Mechanisms
   (A/R CDM) could lead to sustainable development benefits has not so far
   materialized. The main challenges to implementation,of the current A/R
   CDM mechanisms are in ( I) the definition of forest and its
   institutional implications, (2) the projectization that is embedded in
   the definition of CDM, (3) non-linear baselines related to forest
   transitions that complicate attribution, (4) inherent lack of synergy
   with other development activities and (5) high transaction costs and
   temporary nature of credits. In possible new international regimes that
   aim to include all relevant changes in land-use based emissions, a more
   outcome-based programmatic approach may partially replace the project
   cycle assessments of CDM, However, there will still be a need to assess
   the combination of factors and policies that can be expected to enhance
   terrestrial carbon storage through voluntary land-use decisions, by a
   combination of reduced emissions and enhanced storage. Tradeoffs usually
   exist between local livelihoods and carbon storage, but assessment of
   the opportunity costs of C sequestration requires analysis at the
   landscape and community scale at scenario level, including local
   adjustment and optimization, We explored such scenarios for a number of
   cases in Indonesia that range from a forest margin to a degraded lands
   setting. FALLOW model applications were set up for 4 landscapes in
   Indonesia (15-98\% forest cover, 1-55\% grassland, 17-51 persons km(-2))
   to test the internal consistency of the hypothesis that farmer-led
   development of tree-based land-use systems in response to accessible
   markets, legal tenure arrangements, availability of reliable technical
   information and local investment can convert degraded forest lands at
   low public cost and form an attractive alternative to project-based
   interventions with detailed prescriptions and planning. The calculated
   (non-linear) baselines for carbon stocks varied from an average trend of
   -0.26 to +0.23 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) over a 25 year period of assessment,
   equivalent to a net sequestration of -0.95 to 0.84 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)
   The highest value for predicted additional carbon storage in the wider
   landscape did not coincide with the best results for local livelihoods,
   but in each of the case studies the results for a `programmatic' removal
   of constraints to profitable smallholder tree-based production systems
   was more attractive than a `prescribed' tree planting in designated
   project areas. These results Support the design of international

Abstract = {{Although the acid sensitivity of many invertebrate species in lakes is
   well known, methods for assessment of lake acidification based on
   macroinvertebrate samples are less developed than for rivers. This
   article analyses a number of existing metrics developed for assessment
   of river acidification, and evaluates their performance for assessment
   of lake acidification. Moreover, new species-based indicators of lake
   acidification were developed and tested. The selected dataset contains
   668 samples on littoral macroinvertebrates from 427 lakes with almost
   60\% of the samples from Sweden and the rest from UK and Norway.
   Flexible, non-parametric regression models were used for explorative
   analyses of the pressure-response relationships. The metrics have been
   assessed according to their response to pH, the degree of non-linearity
   of the response and the influence of humic compounds. Acid-sensitive
   metrics often showed a threshold in response to pH between 5.8 and 6.5.
   Highly acid-tolerant metrics were typically dominant across the whole pH
   range. Humic level had a positive effect for most acid-sensitive
   metrics. Generally, most metrics showed a more non-linear response
   pattern for the humic lakes than for clear lakes. The significant
   relationship between these macroinvertebrate metrics and acidification
   shows that there is a potential for developing further the assessment
   systems for ecological quality of lakes based on these metrics, although
   the metrics explained a low \% of the variation (< 30\%). In order to
   improve the predictive power of the biotic metrics across the acidified
   part of Europe, further harmonization and standardisation of sampling
   effort and taxa identification are needed.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a comprehensive program to evaluate the post-release phase of
   biocontrol programs that use insect herbivores to control invasive plant
   species. We argue that any release should be done in randomized release
   and non-release sites and should be followed up by well-replicated
   sampling and experimental protocols that evaluate the degree of success
   or failure. These follow-up studies should include landscape scale
   monitoring across relevant habitat gradients of (1) the abundance of the
   biocontrol agent, (2) the impact of the biocontrol agent on the target
   plant species, (3) the potential for non-target effects, and (4) the
   response of native species and communities to a reduction in the
   invasive species. We also argue that (5) experimental reductions of the
   biocontrol agent are required to eliminate the chance that the putative
   impact of the biocontrol agent is not confounded with other causes.
   Finally, we describe six scenarios, informed largely by a community
   ecology perspective, in which a biocontrol agent may decrease the
   abundance or vigor of the target plant species but not lead to
   successful control where native communities re-establish. We classify
   these failure scenarios as either direct or indirect effects of the
   invasive plant species: Native Source Limitation, Static Competitive
   Hierarchies, Novel Weapons, Trophic Shifts, Invasive Engineering and
   Associated Invasives. Overall, we argue that well replicated and
   landscape-scale post release monitoring programs are required not only
   to evaluate critically the degree of success and failure of biocontrol
   programs worldwide but also to provide insights into improving future
   biocontrol efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Hurricanes have visible and invisible effects on forests. The visible
   effects are dramatic, noticeable over the short-term and relatively well
   documented in the literature. Invisible effects are less understood as
   they require well-focused research both in the short- and long-term time
   scales. This review of the literature on hurricane effects focuses on
   the Neotropics and the temperate zone of North America. The material is
   organized according to a heuristic model that distinguishes between
   immediate effects (0 to 3 years), immediate responses (0 to 20 years),
   trajectories of responses (0 to 100 years) and long-term legacies (> 100
   years). It is suggested that the ecological role of hurricanes involves
   six principal effects: 1. they change the ecological space available to
   organisms; 2. they set organisms in motion; 3. they increase the
   heterogeneity of the landscape and the variability in ecosystem
   processes; 4. they rejuvenate the landscape and its ecosystems and
   redirect succession; 5. they shape forest structure, influence their
   species composition and diversity and regulate their function; and 6.
   they induce evolutionary change through natural selection and ecological
   creativity through self-organization. A new approach to hurricane
   research will study hurricanes at the same scale at which they operate
   (i.e., across latitudes and longitudes and over disturbed and
   undisturbed landscapes). This research will require networks of
   observation platforms located along expected hurricane paths to
   facilitate forest structure and functioning observations across
   gradients of hurricane frequency and intensity. This research will also
   require use of remote sensing and automated wireless technology,
   hardened to survive hurricane-strength winds and floods to assure real
   time measurements of the characteristics of hurricanes and ecosystem
   responses. No progress will be forthcoming in the understanding of
   hurricane effects if we do not learn to quantify objectively the energy
   dissipation of hurricanes on the full grid of affected forests as the
   hurricane passes over a landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in temperature, precipitation, and other climatic drivers and

   combined effects of climate change and invasions by providing baseline
   biotic and environmental conditions, although the utility of a survey
   depends on whether the results are quantitative or qualitative, and
   other design considerations. The results from a variety of monitoring
   programs in the United States are available in integrated biological
   information systems, although many include only non-native species, not
   native species. Besides including natives, we suggest these systems
   could be improved through the development of standardized methods that
   capture habitat and physiological requirements and link regional and
   national biological databases into distributed Web portals that allow
   drawing information from multiple sources. Combining the outputs from
   these biological information systems with environmental data would allow
   the development of ecologicalniche models that predict the potential
   distribution or abundance of native and non-native species on the basis
   of current environmental conditions. Environmental projections from
   climate models can be used in these niche models to project changes in
   species distributions or abundances under altered climatic conditions
   and to identify potential high-risk invaders. There are, however, a
   number of challenges, such as uncertainties associated with projections
   from climate and niche models and difficulty in integrating data with

Abstract = {{In the late 2004th year, the new strategy of building a saving society
   (SS) in China has attracted the main attention of experts and
   researchers from governments, universities and institutes. It is
   important, therefore, to model and evaluate the SS.
   Focusing on the designing of an indicator system, the paper aims to
   evaluate the saving states of China. Within the framework it has
   included five sub-systems of resources, economy, society, technology and
   environment, as well as 39 indicators. The method of entropy-value was
   used to decide the weights of every indicator. Moreover, two very
   important indexes, saving development index (SDI) and saving
   coordination index (SCI), were also set up to examine the development of
   the saving society in general and coordination situations of five
   sub-systems.
   Therefore, an empirical analysis on the historical evolution of China's
   saving society from 1990 to 2004 was carried out. It was argued that
   over the past 15 years there have been great changes in the saving
   society of China, but it mainly fell into the ranges of the modest
   saving development, whilst its five sub-systems keeping relatively least
   coordination. This implies that there will be a long way for China to
   realize its saving society in the future. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Relative growth rate (RGR) is currently the most commonly used method
   for measuring and comparing species' intrinsic growth potential.
   Comparative studies have, for example, revealed that small-seeded
   species have higher RGR, leading to the common belief that small-seeded
   species possess physiological adaptations for rapid growth that would
   allow them to outgrow large-seeded species, given sufficient time. We
   show that, because RGR declines as individual plants grow, it is heavily
   biased by initial size and does not measure the size-corrected growth
   potential that determines the outcome of competition in the long term.
   We develop a daily growth model that includes a simple mechanistic
   representation of aboveground and belowground growth and its dependency
   on plant size and environmental factors. Intrinsic growth potential is
   encapsulated by the size-independent growth coefficient, G. We
   parameterized the model using repeated-harvest data from 1724 plants of
   nine species growing in contrasting nutrient and temperature regimes.
   Using information-theoretic criteria, we found evidence for
   interspecific differences in only three of nine model parameters: G,
   aboveground allocation, and frost damage. With other parameters shared
   between species, the model accurately reproduced above-and belowground
   biomass trajectories for all nine species in each set of environmental
   conditions. In contrast to conventional wisdom, the relationship between
   G and seed size was positive, despite a strong negative correlation
   between seed size and average RGR, meaning that large-seeded rather than
   small-seeded species have higher size-corrected growth potential.
   Further, we found a significant positive correlation between G and frost
   damage that, according to simulations, causes rank reversals in final
   biomass under daily temperature changes of +/-5 degrees C. We recommend
   the wider use of this new kind of plant growth analysis as a better way
   of understanding underlying differences in species' physiology; but we
   recognize that RGR is still a useful metric if considering the potential
   rate of population increase in empty habitats.}},

   needed to appropriately translate questions through the community level.
   Species invasion, loss, and turnover all necessitate this scaling
   through community processes, but predicting how such changes may
   influence ecosystem function is notoriously difficult. We suggest that
   community-level dynamics can be incorporated into scaling predictions
   using a trait-based response-effect framework that differentiates the
   community response to environmental change (predicted by response
   traits) and the effect of that change on ecosystem processes (predicted
   by effect traits). We develop a response-and-effect functional
   framework, concentrating on how the relationships among species'
   response, effect, and abundance can lead to general predictions
   concerning the magnitude and direction of the influence of environmental
   change on function. We then detail several key research directions
   needed to better scale the effects of environmental change through the
   community level. These include (1) effect and response trait
   characterization, (2) linkages between response-and-effect traits, (3)
   the importance of species interactions on trait expression, and (4)
   incorporation of feedbacks across multiple temporal scales. Increasing
   rates of extinction and invasion that are modifying communities
   worldwide make such a research agenda imperative.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To produce a robust, comprehensive global biome reconstruction for
   the Middle Pliocene (c. 3.6-2.6 Ma), which is based on an internally
   consistent palaeobotanical data set and a state-of-the-art coupled
   climate-vegetation model. The reconstruction gives a more rigorous
   picture of climate and environmental change during the Middle Pliocene
   and provides a new boundary condition for future general circulation
   model (GCM) studies.
   Location Global.
   Methods Compilation of Middle Pliocene vegetation data from 202 marine
   and terrestrial sites into the comprehensive GIS data base TEVIS
   (Tertiary Environmental Information System). Translation into an
   internally consistent classification scheme using 28 biomes. Comparison
   and synthesis of vegetation reconstruction from palaeodata with the
   outputs of the mechanistically based BIOME4 model forced by climatology
   derived from the HadAM3 GCM.
   Results The model results compare favourably with available palaeodata
   and highlight the importance of employing vegetation-climate feedbacks
   and the anomaly method in biome models. Both the vegetation
   reconstruction from palaeobotanical data and the BIOME4 prediction
   indicate a general warmer and moister climate for the Middle Pliocene.
   Evergreen taiga as well as temperate forest and grassland shifted
   northward, resulting in much reduced tundra vegetation. Warm-temperate
   forests (with subtropical taxa) spread in mid and eastern Europe and
   tropical savannas and woodland expanded in Africa and Australia at the
   expense of deserts. Discrepancies which occurred between data
   reconstruction and model simulation can be related to: (1) poor spatial
   model resolution and data coverage; (2) uncertainties in delimiting
   biomes using climate parameters; or (3) uncertainties in model physics
   and/or geological boundary conditions.
   Main conclusions The new global biome reconstruction combines vegetation
   reconstruction from palaeobotanical proxies with model simulations. It
   is an important contribution to the further understanding of climate and
   vegetation changes during the Middle Pliocene warm interval and will
   enhance our knowledge about how vegetation may change in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability research studies the dynamics and prospects of
   co-evolving human and ecological systems, a subject of inherent
   complexity and deep uncertainty. While work proceeds on facets of the
   overall problem, an overarching theoretical framework for giving
   coherence to this new discipline is lacking. Scenario analysis has been
   proposed as a promising integrative approach, while a recent wave of
   studies has significantly improved scenario methods. Still, these
   studies remain most compelling in their opening frames, where
   quantitative modeling can track unfolding trends, and their closing
   frames, where qualitative description can provide rich descriptions of
   long-term social visions. Not surprisingly, given the formidable
   Uncertainties, the trajectories between ``now{''} and ``then{''}, remain
   poorly specified, if addressed at all. This paper suggests ways of
   thinking about these pathways and pivots, the ``world lines{''} through
   the terra incognita between current global realities and alternative
   futures. It outlines and illustrates a macro-framework, drawing fresh
   insight into the requirements for a transition to sustainability. It
   discusses major analytic elements - a systemic perspective, a scenario
   structure, critical uncertainties, human agency - and combines them into
   depictions of the broad contours of possible pathways. The analysis
   highlights two key uncertainties: the form of forthcoming crises and the
   quality of human response to global challenges. if institutional and
   cultural innovation fails to mute the precursor stressors of a systemic
   crisis, the world line could pivot toward a venal future. However, if
   the world begins to act with foresight, unity, and resolve, development
   would bend toward a resilient global civilization. This transition
   requires a sharp upswing in public awareness and engagement, a
   development that the evolving conditions of our planetary phase of
   history make possible, but by no means inevitable. Here, sustainability
   scenarios have a role in changing the future, as well as illuminating
   it, by expanding the horizon of what is thought possible and deemed
   desirable. The world lines framework offers a conceptual arena for
   advancing this effort. (C) 2008 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Questions: How do changes in forest management, i.e. in disturbance type
   and frequency, influence species diversity, abundance and composition of
   the seed bank? How does the relationship between seed bank and
   vegetation change? What are the implications for seed bank dynamics?
   Location: An ancient Quercus petraea - Carpinus betulus forest in
   conversion from coppice-with-standards to regular Quercus high forest
   near Montargis, France.
   Methods: Seed bank and vegetation were sampled in six replicated stand
   types, forming a chronosequence along the conversion pathway. The stand
   types represented mid-successional stages of stands in transition from
   coppice-with-standards (to high forest (16 plots) and early-and
   mid-successional high forest stands (32 plots).
   Results: Seed bank density and species richness decreased with time
   since last disturbance. Adjusting for seed density effects obscured
   species richness differences between stand types, but species of later
   seres were nested subsets of earlier seres, implying concomitant shifts
   in species richness and composition with time since disturbance. Later
   seres were characterized by species with low seed weight and high seed
   longevity. Seed banks of early seres were more similar to vegetation
   than to later seres.
   Conclusions: Abandonment of the coppice-with-standards regime altered
   the seed bank characteristics, as well as its relationship with
   vegetation. Longer management cycles under high forest yield
   impoverished seed banks. For their persistence, seed bank species will
   increasingly rely on management of permanently open areas in the forest
   landscape. Thus, revegetation at the beginning of new high-forest cycles
   may increasingly depend on inflow from seed sources.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale catastrophic events, although rare, lie generally beyond the
   control of local management and can prevent marine reserves from
   achieving biodiversity outcomes. We formulate a new conservation
   planning problem that aims to minimize the probability of missing
   conservation targets as a result of catastrophic events. To illustrate
   this approach we formulate and solve the problem of minimizing the
   impact of large-scale coral bleaching events on a reserve system for the
   Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We show that by considering the threat of
   catastrophic events as part of the reserve design problem it is possible
   to substantially improve the likely persistence of conservation features

   of the Great Barrier Reef, a 2\% increase in overall reserve cost was
   enough to improve the long-run performance of our reserve network by >
   60\%. Our results also demonstrate that simply aiming to protect the
   reefs at lowest risk of catastrophic bleaching does not necessarily lead
   to the best conservation outcomes, and enormous gains in overall
   persistence can be made by removing the requirement to represent all
   bioregions in the reserve network. We provide an explicit and
   well-defined method that allows the probability of catastrophic
   disturbances to be included in the site selection problem without
   creating additional conservation targets or imposing arbitrary

Abstract = {{Deicing agents, primarily road salt, are applied to roads in 26 states
   in the United States and in a number of European countries, yet the
   scale of impacts of road salt on aquatic organisms remains largely
   under-studied. The issue is germane to amphibian conservation because
   both adult and larval amphibians are known to be particularly sensitive
   to changes in their osmolar environments. In this study, we combined
   survey, experimental, and demographic modeling approaches to evaluate
   the possible effects of road salt on two common vernal-pond-breeding
   amphibian species, the spotted salamander ( Ambystoma maculatum) and the
   wood frog ( Rana sylvatica). We found that in the Adirondack Mountain
   Region of New York ( USA), road salt traveled up to 172 m from the
   highway into wetlands. Surveys showed that egg mass densities of spotted
   salamanders ( A. maculatum) and wood frogs ( R. sylvatica) were two
   times higher in forest pools than roadside pools, but this pattern was
   better explained by road proximity than by increased salinity.
   Experiments demonstrated that embryonic and larval survival were reduced
   at moderate ( 500 mu S) and high conductivities ( 3000 mu S) in A.
   maculatum and at high conductivities in R. sylvatica. Demographic models
   suggest that such egg and larval stage effects of salt may have
   important impacts on populations near roads, particularly in the case of
   A. maculatum, for which salt exposure may lead to local extinction. For
   both species, the effect of road salt was dependent upon the strength of
   larval density dependence and declined rapidly with distance from the
   roadside, with the greatest negative effects being limited to within 50
   m. Based on this evidence, we argue that efforts to protect local
   populations of A. maculatum and R. sylvatica in roadside wetlands
   should, in part, be aimed at reducing application of road salt near
   wetlands with high conductivity levels.}},

Abstract = {{Management of invasive species involves choosing between different
   management strategy options, but often the best strategy for a
   particular scenario is not obvious. We illustrate the use of
   optimization methods to determine the most effcient management strategy
   using one of the most devastating invasive forest pests in North
   America, the gypsy moth ( Lymantria dispar), as a case study. The
   optimization approach involves the application of stochastic dynamic
   programming ( SDP) to a metapopulation framework with different
   infestation patch sizes, with the goal of minimizing infestation spread.
   We use a novel ``moving window'' approach as a way to address a
   spatially explicit problem without being explicitly spatial. We examine
   results for two cases in order to develop general rules of thumb for
   management. We explore a model with limited parameter information and
   then assess how strategies change with specific parameterization for the
   gypsy moth. The model results in a complex but stable, state-dependent
   management strategy for a multiyear management program that is robust
   even under situations of uncertainty. The general rule of thumb for the
   basic model consists of three strategies: eradicating medium-density
   infestations, reducing large-density infestations, and reducing the
   colonization rate from the main infestation, depending on the state of
   the system. With specific gypsy moth parameterization, reducing
   colonization decreases in importance relative to the other two
   strategies. The application of this model to gypsy moth management
   emphasizes the importance of managing based on the state of the system,
   and if applied to a specific geographic area, has the potential to
   substantially improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of current
   gypsy moth eradication programs, helping to slow the spread of this
   pest. Additionally, the approach used for this particular invasive
   species can be extended to the optimization of management programs for
   the spread of other invasive and problem species exhibiting
   metapopulation dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of a stated preference study that
   estimates the economic value for cleaning up acid rock drainage in
   Colorado's Snake River watershed. In contrast to much of the existing
   literature, the present study emphasizes benefit estimation for three
   implementing projects rather than benefit estimation for general changes
   in water quality or large scale water quality policy. The focus on
   implementing projects delivers information that is specifically relevant
   to current decisions being faced in the watershed. While valuation
   questions in most stated preference studies present costs that have no
   relation to actual project costs, this study presents a new cost share
   approach. Project costs are estimated and then valuation questions
   present different local cost shares to subjects. This approach
   facilitates stated cost variation necessary for estimating the mean of
   the distribution of project values without resorting to experimentally
   designed, fictitious stated costs. in addition to estimating the mean
   value, which facilitates benefit cost analysis, the study also provides
   median value estimates, which provide insights into the political
   feasibility of these projects. Study results suggest that local cost
   shares on the order of 20\%-40\%, depending on the project, are

Abstract = {{Question: The mosaic-cycle concept of forest dynamics dominates in
   Central Europe. According to this concept intermediate-scale
   disturbances only accelerate the forest break-up under existing cycles
   of forest development. Is such an approach correct, or should new
   developmental cycles be elaborated for intermediate-scale disturbances?
   Location: Near-natural Abies alba - Fagus sylvatica forests in the
   Swietokrzyski National Park in Central Poland. In these forests
   intermediate-scale disturbances occurred between 1970 and 1990.
   Methods: Data were collected twice in areas surrounding 212 permanent
   sample points ( in 1994 and 2004). Two increment cores were taken from
   259 sample Abies trees. The effect of intermediate-scale disturbances on
   radial increment of Abies was assessed. Probabilities of stand
   transition during a 10-year period between individual stages and phases
   of development of the mixed forest were calculated. The development
   stages and phases were arranged into hypothetical succession series of
   successive changes.
   Results: In 1994 70 stands and in 2004, 47 stands representing stages
   and phases containing the older generation formed by trees > 100-150
   years were found. Also, in 1994 142 and in 2004, 165 stands representing
   stages and phases containing the younger generations only, formed by
   trees < 100-150 years, were recorded. Stages and phases containing only
   younger generations do not occur in the existing forest development
   cycle which does not consider the influence of intermediate-scale
   disturbances separately. Two developmental cycles, which take into
   account the presence of the older generation and the younger generations
   only ( under conditions of the occurrence of intermediate-scale
   disturbances), are proposed.
   Conclusion: The mosaic-cycle concept of forest dynamics can be used to
   analyse the dynamics of Central European near-natural mixed-species
   forests, but new developmental cycles should be elaborated for
   intermediate-scale disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Age at first reproduction (AFR) has been difficult to quantify in
   mammals, as the most commonly used methods require reproductive tracts
   or direct observations. However, work in several large mammal species
   suggests that the width of cementum light bands in teeth decline once
   females begin to reproduce, suggesting that teeth structures might
   provide a new tool to examine AFR. To determine if changes in cementum
   light band width could be used to calculate AFR for the northern sea
   otter (Enhydra lutris kenyoni), we measured cementum light band widths
   on sectioned premolar teeth and compared them to reproductive tracts. We
   classified otters as parous if any single light band was narrower than a
   threshold value, selected as the value that minimized error rates. At a
   threshold value of 0.32, we correctly identified otters as parous, or
   nulliparous in 83\% of cases (n = 92) as compared to reproductive
   tracts, and the AFR estimated from teeth samples (3.52 +/- 0.032 yr) was
   not different from that determined by reproductive tract analysis (3.45
   +/- 0.031 yr; t-test, P > 0.05). These data support the use of cementum
   as an indicator of past reproduction in individual female otters, which
   can then be used to estimate average AFR. Given that declines in
   cementum width have been described for other mammal species, the same
   quantitative approach used here could be applied to other species.}},

Abstract = {{Long series of observations on environmental processes provide a
   baseline record to better gauge recent episodes relative to prior ones.
   In this context, episodes are consecutive observations either above or
   below a reference level. Such episodes can be quantified in terms of
   three random variables: duration (the number of time intervals in the
   episode), magnitude (the sum of all process values for a given
   duration), and peak value (the absolute maximum reached by the process
   within a given episode). In this paper we present a new stochastic model
   for the bivariate distribution of episode duration and maxima (peak
   values). The model follows naturally (in the mathematical sense) from
   the definition of episodes, it properly reflects the randomness of
   duration, and it answers an explicit call made by several authors for a
   theoretical (rather than empirical) modeling of episode parameters. The
   model, which is based on the stochastic theory of random maxima, is
   called BTLG because it is Bivariate and has Truncated Logistic and
   Geometric marginals. Such mixture of discrete and continuous components
   reflects the discrete nature of duration and the continuous nature of
   the peak value. A similar approach was used for our previously published
   bivariate stochastic model of episode duration and magnitude {[}Biondi,

   climate episodes, Int. J. Climatol., 25, 1253 - 1264; Kozubowski, T.J.,
   Panorska, A.K., 2005. A mixed bivariate distribution with exponential
   and geometric marginals. J. Stat. Plann. Inference, 134, 501 - 5201. The
   BTLG model was applied to a 2300-year long dendroclimatic record from
   the eastern Sierra Nevada headwaters of the Walker River, between
   California and Nevada. After testing the sensitivity of this proxy
   record as a moisture (water-year precipitation) indicator, positive
   (wet) and negative (dry) episodes (467 each) were stochastically
   modeled. Maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters, as well as
   expected and observed distributions, were computed, showing an overall
   good fit. The practical use of the model was illustrated by computing
   the likelihood of extended dry and wet episodes, including the 1930s
   drought and the early 1900s pluvial. Our results show that the chance of
   an extreme dry period is much greater than the chance of an extreme wet

Abstract = {{The study of turtle population genetics has come a long way in the past
   few decades. In the early 1990s, technologies such as polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) and automated DNA sequencing spearheaded a boom in
   molecular ecology. Microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA haplotype
   markers became the methods of choice for many turtle studies. Today, the
   rate of research continues unabated. The emergence of new methods,
   approaches and ideas means exciting prospects for the molecular ecology
   of marine turtles. A review of genetic markers that have been used for
   turtle research provides a starting point for those breaking into this
   area for the first time. Here current molecular techniques are
   discussed, but upcoming new ideas and methods are also highlighted. A
   recently proposed hypothesis to explain the polyandrous behaviour of
   female turtles means a fresh direction for multiple paternity studies. A
   new statistical approach (individual-based analysis) offers future
   studies analytical methods other than F-statistics, and an alternative
   means to test male-biased gene flow. Paternity analysis now enables
   robust reconstruction of male genotypes from their offspring,
   elucidating the genetics of adult male turtles without collecting them
   in the field. With whole genome amplification (WGA) limited DNA samples
   can be amplified for long-terns storage, large-scale analyses and easy
   exchange between laboratories. New genetic markers are essential for
   future progress, and breakthrough DNA sequencing technologies will
   facilitate marker discovery. The next-generation sequencing methods also
   means that the new `-omics' techniques of genomics and transcriptomics
   may in the future be applicable to marine turtle research. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{Local range expansions might either be the response of populations to
   climate or landscape change, or be caused directly by human
   intervention. In the latter case the expansion would be considered the
   first in the steps leading to a biological invasion. In species
   typically not the subject of human commerce, distinguishing the causes
   of local range expansions is problematic. Range dynamic theory provides
   a basis for doing so, and, when used to assess phylogeographical
   information, can be a powerful conservation biogeographical approach.
   Here we adopt this approach to resolve the controversial case of the
   recent range expansion of the painted reed frog (Hyperolius marmoratus)
   in southern South Africa. Within the last decade, H. marmoratus has
   spread westward approximately 500 km from its historical range. This
   local range expansion could either represent human-mediated jump
   dispersal, or a response to landscape or climate change. To date, the
   latter has been assumed, although not universally. Using a
   phylogeographic approach to investigate these competing hypotheses, a
   portion of the mitochondrial COI gene was sequenced for individuals from
   within the historical range (n = 178), and four putatively introduced
   populations in dams (n = 121). There was substantial geographical
   population structure within the historical range, and these populations
   were significantly different from the dam populations (Phi(ST) = 0.817,
   P < 0.001). The presence of one or a few dissimilar haplotypes in the
   dams suggests that introductions are from a number of different sources.
   This, in conjunction with new survey data, supports the hypothesis that
   recent establishment of these populations is the result of
   human-mediated jump dispersal. The impact of this range expansion on
   ecosystem functioning is unknown, but given the rapid spread of this
   species and its potential influence on ecosystems, safeguards should be
   put in place to control further introductions and to restrict the
   currently invasive populations.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Reservoirs have altered the flow regime of most rivers on the globe. To
   simulate the natural flow regime, experimental foods are being
   implemented on regulated rivers throughout the world to improve their
   ecological integrity. As a large-scale disturbance, the long-term
   sequential use of floods provides an excellent empirical approach to
   examine ecosystem regime shifts in rivers. This study evaluated the
   long-term effects of floods (15 floods over eight years) on a regulated
   river. We hypothesized that sequential floods over time would cause a
   regime shift in the ecosystem. The floods resulted in little change in
   the physicochemistry of the river, although particulate organic carbon
   and particulate phosphorus were lower after the floods. The floods
   eliminated moss cover on bed sediments within the first year of flooding
   and maintained low periphyton biomass and benthic organic matter after
   the third year of flooding. Organic matter in transport was reduced
   after the third year of flooding, although peaks were still observed
   during rain events due to tributary inputs and side slopes. The floods
   reduced macroinvertebrate richness and biomass after the. rst year of
   floods, but density was not reduced until the third year. The individual
   mass of invertebrates decreased by about one-half after the floods.
   Specific taxa displayed either a loss in abundance, or an increase in
   abundance, or an increase followed by a loss after the third year. The.
   rst three flood years were periods of nonequilibrium with coefficients
   of variation in all measured parameters increasing two to five times
   from those before the floods. Coefficients of variation decreased after
   the third year, although they were still higher than before the floods.
   Analysis of concordance using Kendall's W confirmed the temporal changes
   observed in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. An assessment of
   individual flood effects showed that later floods had similar to 30\%
   less effect on macroinvertebrates than early floods of similar
   magnitude, suggesting that the new assemblage structure is more
   resilient to flood disturbance. We conclude that the floods caused an
   ecosystem regime shift that took three years to unfold. Additional
   long-term changes or shifts are expected as new taxa colonize the river
   from other sources.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To describe the geographical pattern of mean body size of the
   non-volant mammals of the Nearctic and Neotropics and evaluate the
   influence of five environmental variables that are likely to affect body
   size gradients.
   Location The Western Hemisphere.
   Methods We calculated mean body size (average log mass) values in 110 x
   110 km cells covering the continental Nearctic and Neotropics. We also
   generated cell averages for mean annual temperature, range in elevation,
   their interaction, actual evapotranspiration, and the global vegetation
   index and its coefficient of variation. Associations between mean body
   size and environmental variables were tested with simple correlations
   and ordinary least squares multiple regression, complemented with
   spatial autocorrelation analyses and split-line regression. We evaluated
   the relative support for each multiple-regression model using AIC.
   Results Mean body size increases to the north in the Nearctic and is
   negatively correlated with temperature. In contrast, across the
   Neotropics mammals are largest in the tropical and subtropical lowlands
   and smaller in the Andes, generating a positive correlation with
   temperature. Finally, body size and temperature are nonlinearly related
   in both regions, and split-line linear regression found temperature
   thresholds marking clear shifts in these relationships (Nearctic 10.9
   degrees C; Neotropics 12.6 degrees C). The increase in body sizes with
   decreasing temperature is strongest in the northern Nearctic, whereas a
   decrease in body size in mountains dominates the body size gradients in
   the warmer parts of both regions.
   Main conclusions We confirm previous work finding strong broad-scale
   Bergmann trends in cold macroclimates but not in warmer areas. For the
   latter regions (i.e. the southern Nearctic and the Neotropics), our
   analyses also suggest that both local and broad-scale patterns of mammal
   body size variation are influenced in part by the strong mesoscale
   climatic gradients existing in mountainous areas. A likely explanation
   is that reduced habitat sizes in mountains limit the presence of
   larger-sized mammals.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To investigate the effects of human-induced landscape changes in
   Mediterranean islands on the ecological and evolutionary responses of
   bird communities and populations. The combination of mass extinction of
   large mammals and massive deforestation by humans was hypothesized to
   produce new selection regimes to which organisms were likely to respond.
   Habitat selection and niche breadth have been investigated at the scale
   of species, and phenotypic variation at the scale of local populations.
   Location The study was carried out along habitat gradients and in
   habitat mosaics at different spatial scales on the island of Corsica and
   in areas of similar size and structure in continental France.
   Methods Two sets of gradients have been used for investigating habitat
   selection and niche breadth: gradients of altitude, and gradients of
   vegetation structure. Population studies focused on the blue tit,
   Cyanistes caeruleus. Large samples of breeding attempts by this species
   in 10 habitats provided detailed data on phenotypic variation of
   fitness-related traits both on Corsica and on the mainland.
   Results The extent of niche space used by birds differed substantially
   depending on which habitat gradient was considered. Many species have
   been found to contract their habitat niche along the elevation gradient
   on Corsica compared with the mainland, whereas all species in the
   vegetation gradient broadened their niche on the island. Breeding
   patterns of the blue tit differed considerably depending on whether they
   settle in deciduous oaks (Quercus humilis) or in evergreen
   sclerophyllous oaks (Quercus ilex). Phenotypic variation of breeding
   traits was much higher on the island, where more populations were
   correctly timed for the best breeding period than on the mainland, a
   pattern that is likely to result from lower dispersal of organisms on
   the island.
   Main conclusions The differences in observed niche breadth between the
   two series of habitat gradients is explained both by the
   species-specific ecology of the species and the human-induced
   environmental history of Corsica. Large-scale landscape changes provided
   new opportunities for island colonization by non-forest species, which
   are isolated as small, `fugitive' local populations. In both gradients,
   forest species that are typical components of the Corsican bird fauna
   definitely expanded their niche and occupied a wider range of habitats
   on Corsica than on the mainland. At the population scale, landscapes
   included habitat patches with contrasted selection regimes, which
   resulted in high phenotypic variation for many fitness-related traits.
   Reduced dispersal of birds on the island resulted in a much higher
   degree of local differentiation on Corsica than on the mainland.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   Large hurricanes have profound impacts on temperate forests, but owing
   to their infrequent nature these effects have rarely been examined in
   detail. In 1996, Hurricane Fran significantly damaged many long-term
   tree census plots in the Duke Forest on the North Carolina Piedmont,
   thereby providing an exceptional opportunity to examine pre- and
   post-hurricane forest compositional trajectories. Our goal was to
   examine immediate, short-term (0-4 years) and longer term (similar to 5
   year) hurricane-induced structural, spatial and compositional changes in
   the tree population (stem d.b.h > 1 cm) in the context of our detailed,
   long-term knowledge of the dynamics of these forests.
   Methods
   We surveyed stem damage and tree mortality in 34 long-term permanent
   plots (ca. 70-year record; 404-1 012 m(2)) and 7 large mapped tree
   stands (ca. 20-year record; 5 250-65 000 m(2)) representing both
   transition-phase, even-aged pine stands and uneven-aged upland hardwood
   forests. We employed three types of damage measures to quantify
   stand-level damage severity: percentage of stems damaged, percentage of
   basal area lost and a `stand-level damage index'. Second-order spatial
   analysis (Ripley's K-function) was used to investigate patterns in tree
   mortality.
   Important findings
   Our study found hurricane effects on the structural attributes of
   Piedmont forests to be variable and patchy. Changes in tree species
   composition, however, were modest. Uprooting was the major damage type
   for the overstory trees {[}diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) > 10 cm]
   apparently due to the exposure of the crowns to high wind combined with
   heavy rainfall prior to and during the storm. Saplings, juvenile trees
   and small trees (1-10 cm d.b.h.) of the understory and midstory were
   mainly damaged by being pinned or bent by their damaged large neighbors.
   Hurricane-induced tree mortality varied weakly among species, was
   positively correlated with pre-hurricane tree size and remained up to
   2-fold higher than pre-hurricane background mortality 5 years after the
   hurricane. Spatial point pattern analysis revealed a patchy distribution
   of tree mortality during the hurricane sampling interval. Hurricane Fran
   resulted in a dramatic increase in average gap size from ca. 400 m(2)
   pre-hurricane to ca 1100 m(2) after the hurricane, whereas maximum gap
   sizes reached 18-34 times larger than the pre-hurricane levels.}},

Abstract = {{A major goal of population genetics research is to identify the relative
   influences of historical and contemporary processes that serve to
   structure genetic variation. Most population genetic models assume that
   populations exist in a state of migration-drift equilibrium. However, in
   the past this assumption has rarely been verified, and is likely rarely
   achieved in natural populations. We assessed the equilibrium status at
   both local and regional scales of the Atlantic killifish, Fundulus
   heteroclitus. This species is a model organism for the study of adaptive
   clinal variation, but has also experienced a complicated history of
   range expansion and secondary contact following allopatric divergence,
   potentially obscuring the influence of contemporary evolutionary
   processes. Presumptively neutral genetic markers (microsatellites)
   demonstrated zones of secondary intergradation among coastal populations
   centred around northern New Jersey and the Chesapeake Bay region.
   Analysis of genetic variation indicated isolation by distance among some
   populations and provided supporting evidence that the Delaware Bay, but
   not the Chesapeake Bay, has acted as a barrier to dispersal among
   coastal populations. Bayesian estimates indicated large effective
   population sizes and low migration rates, and were in good agreement
   with empirically derived estimates of population and neighbourhood size
   from mark-recapture studies. These data indicate that populations are
   not in migration-drift equilibrium at a regional scale, and suggest that
   contributing factors include large population size combined with
   relatively low migration rates. These conditions should be considered
   when interpreting the evolutionary significance of the distribution of
   genetic variation among F. heteroclitus populations.}},

Abstract = {{White cypress pine Callitris glaucophylla is an important native tree

   Model parameters were optimised using reference data from 6- to 36-year
   silvicultural trials in central-western New South Wales (NSW).
   Predictions of the calibrated model compared favourably to actual
   growth, survival and recruitment of C. glaucophylla in the reference
   data, as well as in an independent dataset not used in optimisation. We
   tested whether remaining differences between predictions and actual data
   were related to variation in site productivity (a function of moisture
   availability as influenced by soil and landscape factors not modelled).
   Growth was overestimated in low-productivity sites and underestimated in
   high-productivity sites. Growth predictions were improved by using
   site-specific expected maximum heights to reflect site productivity. We
   also tested whether the model and parameter set produce dynamics
   consistent with those observed over the last half century. Modelled
   growth, survival, recruitment and competition processes were consistent
   with data and observations in previous studies on historical dynamics
   and stand behaviour of C. glaucophylla. The model has a wide range of
   potential applications for understanding past and predicting future
   stand dynamics. To illustrate an application of the model to thinning, a
   strategy currently being implemented to manage tree densities in inland
   NSW, we compared predicted stand structures in simulations of different
   thinning treatments. The simulations showed that without careful
   manipulation of existing canopy cover, stands can re-fill to
   pre-thinning densities within relatively short periods of time. Crown

Abstract = {{We developed an integrated hydroecological model to provide a
   comprehensive set of hydrologic variables representing five major
   components of the flow regime at 856 aquatic-invertebrate monitoring
   sites in New Jersey. The hydroecological model simulates streamflow by
   routing water that moves overland and through the subsurface from
   atmospheric delivery to the watershed outlet. Snow accumulation and
   melt, evapotranspiration, precipitation, withdrawals, discharges,
   pervious- and impervious-area runoff, and lake storage were accounted
   for in the water balance. We generated more than 78 flow variables,
   which describe the frequency, magnitude, duration, rate of change, and
   timing of flow events. Highly correlated variables were filtered by
   principal component analysis to obtain a non-redundant subset of
   variables that explain the majority of the variation in the complete
   set. This subset of variables was used to evaluate the effect of changes
   in the flow regime on aquatic-invertebrate assemblage structure at 856
   biomonitoring sites. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS)
   to evaluate variation in aquatic-invertebrate assemblage structure
   across a disturbance gradient. We employed multiple linear regression
   (MLR) analysis to build a series of MLR models that identify the most
   important environmental and hydrologic variables driving the differences
   in the aquatic-invertebrate assemblages across the disturbance gradient.
   The first axis of NMS ordination was significantly related to many
   hydrologic, habitat, and land-use/land-cover variables, including the
   average number of annual storms producing runoff, ratio of 2S-75\%
   exceedance flow (flashiness), diversity of natural stream substrate, and
   the percentage of forested land near the stream channel (forest buffer).
   Modifications in the hydrologic regime as the result of changes in
   watershed land use appear to promote the retention of highly tolerant
   aquatic species; in contrast, species that are sensitive to hydrologic
   instability and other anthropogenic disturbance become much less
   prevalent. We also found strong relations between an index of
   invertebrate-assemblage impairment, its component metrics, and the
   primary disturbance gradient. The process-oriented watershed modeling
   approach used in this study provides a means to evaluate how natural
   landscape features interact with anthropogenic factors and assess their
   effects on flow characteristics and stream ecology. By combining
   watershed modeling and indirect ordination techniques, we were able to
   identify components of the hydrologic regime that have a considerable
   effect on aquatic-assemblage structure and help in developing short- and
   long-term management measures that mitigate the effects of anthropogenic
   disturbance in stream systems. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In the FertOrgaNic EU project, 3 years of field experiments with drip
   irrigation and fertigation were carried out at six different sites
   across Europe, involving seven different varieties of potato. The Daisy
   model, which simulates plant growth together with water and nitrogen
   dynamics, was used to simulate the field experiments. An initial potato
   parameterisation was generated from an independent dataset and was used
   for site-specific calibrations. At those sites where the same variety
   was used for all 3 years, the calibration of the initial potato model
   was based on the first 2 years using the last year for validation. From
   the site-specific parameterisations, shared traits were extracted into a
   common parameterisation. This resulted in a list of the parameters that
   six independent people found had the most impact on the simulations.
   This common parameterisation we argue is a valuable platform for
   adaptation of the Daisy model to new potato varieties or for the
   improvement of the existing parameter set. The procedure is then, as a
   starting point, to focus the calibration process on the recommended list
   of parameters to change. We demonstrate this approach by showing the
   procedure for recalibrating three varieties using all relevant data from
   the sites. We believe these new parameterisations to be more robust,
   because they indirectly were based on information from the six different
   sites. We claim that this procedure combines both local and specific
   modeller expertise in a way that results in more robust and general
   parameterisations than if the common parameterisation step had been
   skipped. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We measured the net progress of land reform in achieving a national
   policy goal for biodiversity conservation in the context of ongoing
   clearing of native vegetation and additions of land to a highly
   nonrepresentative (residual) reserve network, interior South Island, New
   Zealand. We used systematic conservation-planning approaches to develop
   a spatially explicit index of risk of biodiversity loss (RBL). The index
   incorporated information from national data sets that describe New
   Zealand's remaining indigenous land cover, legal protection, and land
   environments and modeled risk to biodiversity on the basis of stated
   assumptions about the effects of past habitat loss and legal protection.
   The index identified irreplaceable and vulnerable native habitats in
   lowland environments as the most at risk of biodiversity loss, and risk
   was correlated with the density of threatened plant records. To measure
   achievement, we used changes in the index that reflected gains made and
   opportunity costs incurred by legal protection and privatization.
   Application of the index to measure the difference made by land reform
   showed it had caused a net increase in the risk of biodiversity loss
   because most land vulnerable to habitat modification and rich in
   threatened plant species was privatized and land at least risk of
   biodiversity loss was protected. The application revealed that new
   high-elevation reserves did little to mitigate biodiversity decline,
   that privatization of low-elevation land further jeopardized the most
   vulnerable biodiversity in lowland native habitats, and that outcomes of
   land reform for biodiversity deteriorated over time. Further development
   of robust achievement measures is needed to encourage more accountable
   biodiversity conservation decisions.}},

Pages = {{729-740}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{After several decades of academic research on the contingent valuation
   (CV) method a consistent behavioral explanation of `hypothetical bias'
   is still lacking. Based on evidence from economics, economic psychology
   and the political sciences, I propose an explanation that is based on
   two simple working hypotheses about respondent behavior in contingent
   valuation surveys. The first hypothesis is that survey respondents are
   unable to form consistent preferences about unfamiliar goods unless the
   choice context offers reliable, informative cues which can be rationally
   exploited in simplified heuristics. The second hypothesis is that the
   probability and impact of strategic responses in dichotomous-choice
   questions about public goods depends on the extent to which the
   presented hypothetical costs differ from the actual costs. The
   literature on hypothetical bias is revisited in the light of these
   behavioral hypotheses. I find that the hypotheses are generally
   supported by the empirical data. Moreover, the hypotheses are able to
   explain several important empirical phenomena that previous research has
   not been able to explain. In particular, they solve the puzzle that
   pre-election polls, but not CV surveys, are able to predict actual
   referendum outcomes, and they explain why income effects on willingness
   to pay are lower in CV responses than in actual votes. if confirmed by
   further studies, the hypotheses will have important implications for
   future research and practice. First, the hypothetical costs presented in
   the dichotomous-choice question should to be close enough to the actual
   costs to be credible to all respondents. This can be achieved by
   specifying the costs as a percentage (rather than absolute) change in
   taxes. Second, the respondents should be given the option to answer
   based on information about the positions of large parties and interest
   groups with known political orientation rather than based on the raw
   policy information. Theory and evidence suggest that this new survey
   paradigm largely eliminates the fundamental problems of the conventional
   stated preference methods. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a Belgian case study on the Index of
   Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW). The index is first compiled using
   the standard methodology applied in other international studies. Owing
   to the short period in which Belgium's `traditional' ISEW has recently
   declined, it is not possible to draw any solid conclusion regarding
   Max-Neefs; `threshold hypothesis'. After a brief review of the criticism
   that the ISEW has attracted over the years, the paper then explains and
   discusses the rationale for omitting the `net capital growth' and
   `change in net international investment position' items. It is argued
   that these items do not comply with the theoretical foundation
   underpinning the ISEW. The paper also puts forward new valuation methods
   for several items within the index: the escalation factor in the
   valuation of natural capital depletion is dropped, long-term
   environmental damage is valued using a stock-based approach and
   considerably more government expenditures are considered to be
   non-defensive. The results of the `revised' ISEW show significant
   improvements in sustainable economic welfare over the entire study
   period. These findings are not in line with the `threshold hypothesis'.
   Finally, the paper offers some guidelines for communicating about the
   ISEW - namely that (a) all methodological assumptions should be made
   explicit and (b) all raw (unadjusted) data used should be included in
   any final ISEW report so as to enable the reader to make his or her own
   assessment about the assumptions the researcher has employed. (C) 2007

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Many animal species have developed specific evolutionary adaptations to
   survive prolonged periods of low energy availability that characterize
   seasonal environments. The seasonal course of primary production, a
   major aspect of ecosystem functioning, should therefore be an important
   factor determining the habitat quality of such species. We tested this
   hypothesis by analyzing the relationship between habitat quality and
   ecosystem functioning for brown bears (Ursus arctos), a species showing
   hyperphagia and hibernation as evolutionary adaptation to seasonal peaks
   and bottlenecks in ecosystem productivity, respectively. Our unique
   long-term data set comprised data from two brown bear populations in
   northern Spain on historical presence, current presence, and
   reproduction. The data were classified on a grid of 5 3 5 km pixels into
   five classes: frequent reproduction, sporadic reproduction, frequent
   presence, sporadic presence, and recent extinction. We used the
   long-term average of the seasonal course of NDVI (normalized difference
   vegetation index) as a proxy for ecosystem functioning and investigated
   the relationship between habitat quality and ecosystem functioning with
   methods borrowed from statistical point-pattern analysis.
   We found that brown bears indeed selected habitat with specific
   ecosystem functioning (i.e., the variance in all habitat classes was
   smaller than in the landscape overall) and the relationship between
   habitat quality and ecosystem functioning was ordered. First, the
   average distance in ecosystem functioning between two habitat classes
   was larger if the difference in habitat quality was larger. Second,
   habitat for which there was the greatest need (i.e., breeding habitat)
   occupied the narrowest niche regarding ecosystem functioning and showed
   the most pronounced seasonality. Progressively poorer classes occupied
   wider niches that partly overlapped those of better classes. This
   indicated that nonbreeding animals are less selective.
   Our methodology provided new insight into the relationship between
   ecosystem functioning and habitat quality and could be widely applied to
   animal species living in seasonal environments. Because NDVI data are
   continuously collected, our methodology allows for continuous monitoring
   of changes in habitat quality due to global change.}},

   toxicity in freshwater lakes. Multiple endpoints were selected to
   measure potential negative impacts from MeHg body burdens on behavior,
   physiology, survival and reproductive success. A robust spatio-temporal
   dataset was used that included nearly 5,500 loon Hg measurements over an
   18-year period. We measured significant changes related to elevated MeHg
   body burdens, including aberrant incubation behavior, lethargy, and wing
   area asymmetry. Mercury body burdens in adult loons increased an average
   of 8.4\% per year. Increasing Hg body burdens reduced the number of
   fledged chicks per territorial pair, with highest risk loons producing
   41\% fewer fledged young than our reference group. Our multiple
   endpoints establish adverse effect thresholds for adult loons at 3.0
   ug/g (wet weight) in blood and 40.0 ug/g (fresh weight) in feathers.
   Mercury contamination in parts of Maine and New Hampshire is a driving

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{325-333}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. The breeding success of Finnish grouse has been in decline for
   decades. While it has been shown that fragmentation and modern forestry
   practices such as clear-cutting affect the viability of grouse
   populations, little is known about effects of large-scale drainage. The
   drainage network in Finland has increased dramatically during the past
   decades. By 1988, 6 million ha of bog ecosystems had been drained. This
   is likely to have had a profound direct and indirect effects on grouse
   productivity. Because ditches persist in time, large-scale drainage may
   therefore have strong potential for affecting the long-term breeding
   success of three forest grouse species in Finland.
   2. Using a mixed-model approach on nation-wide data, we estimate the
   effects of drainage on breeding success of three grouse species for the
   period from 1966 to 1988. The possible additive effect of precipitation
   is investigated using regional precipitation data. For each species, we
   compare a set of hypotheses and select the best model(s) according to
   the Akaike information criterion.
   3. For all species, the model which included the main effects of both
   ditch density and precipitation outperformed the models with just one of
   the main effects as well as the interaction model. The effects are
   restricted to southern and central Finland, where drainage is most
   intensive.
   4. The effects of drainage are likely to be both direct and indirect,
   but the mechanisms are less clear. Both bottom-up, such as decreased
   availability of insect food, and top-down effects, such as increased
   predation risk, may account for indirect effects. Direct effects are
   likely to involve drowning of chicks.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Bogs are classified as key biotopes by
   the European Union, and Finland is obliged to maintain their favourable
   conservation status and to protect typical bog communities. While this
   goal may be achieved for state-owned land, restoration of drainage
   systems on private land continues. Considering the persistence of
   ditches, new legislation are therefore needed to favour the recovery of
   former bogs and mires on private land as well as to protect remaining
   ones.}},

   Location: Ogawa Forest Reserve, a remnant ( 98 ha), species-rich,
   temperate deciduous forest in central Japan ( 36 degrees 56' N, 140
   degrees 35' E, 600 - 660 m a. s. l.).
   Methods: We estimated the demographic parameters ( survival, growth rate
   and fecundity) by stage of each species growing in gaps and under closed
   canopy through observations of a 6-ha permanent plot over 12 years.
   Population dynamics were analysed with stage-based matrix models
   including gap dynamics.
   Results: All of the species showed high seedling and sapling survival
   rates under closed canopies. However, demographic parameters for each
   growth stage in gaps and under closed canopies revealed inter-specific
   differences and ontogenetic shifts. The trade-off between survival in
   the shade and growth in gaps was detected only at the small sapling
   stage ( height < 30 cm), and Ar had the highest growth rate both in the
   shade and in the gaps at most life stages.
   Conclusions: Inter-specific differences and ontogenetic shifts in light
   requirements with life-form differences may contribute to the
   coexistence of the Acer species in old-growth forests, with Aa
   considered a long-lived sub-canopy tree, Am a long-lived canopy tree,

   individuals are intrinsically stochastic and often subject to severe
   observation error. Linking such complex data to dynamical models of
   movement is a major challenge for animal ecology. Here, we review a
   statistical approach, state-space modelling, which involves changing how
   we analyse movement data and draw inferences about the behaviours that
   shape it. The statistical robustness and predictive ability of
   state-space models make them the most promising avenue towards a new
   type of movement ecology that fuses insights from the study of animal
   behaviour, biogeography and spatial population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how vulnerable forest ecosystems are to climate change is
   a key requirement if sustainable forest management is to be achieved.
   Modelling the response of species in their regeneration niche to
   phenological and biophysical processes that are directly influenced by
   climate is one method for achieving this understanding. A model was
   developed to investigate species resilience and vulnerability to climate
   change within its fundamental-regeneration niche. The utility of the
   developed model, tree and climate assessment (TACA), was tested within
   the interior Douglas-fir ecosystem in south-central British Columbia.
   TACA modelled the current potential tree species composition of the
   ecosystem with high accuracy and modelled significant responses amongst
   tree species to climate change. The response of individual species
   suggests that the studied ecosystem could transition to a new ecosystem
   over the next 100 years. TACA showed that it can be an effective tool
   for identifying species resilience and vulnerability to changes in
   climate within the most sensitive stage of development, the regeneration
   phase. The TACA model was able to identify the degree of change in
   phenological and biophysical variables that control tree establishment,
   growth and persistence. The response to changes in one or more of these
   variables resulted in changes in the climatic suitability of the
   ecosystem for species and enabled a measure of vulnerability to be
   quantified. TACA could be useful to forest managers as a decision
   support tool for adaptation actions and by researchers interested in
   modelling stand dynamics under climate change. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the time series proper-ties of per capita CO2
   emissions and per capita GDP levels for a sample of 86 countries over
   the period 1960-2000. For that purpose, we employ a state-of-the-art
   panel stationarity test which incorporates multiple shifts in level and
   slope, thereby controlling for cross-sectional dependence through
   bootstrap methods. Our analysis renders clear-cut evidence that per
   capita GDP levels are nonstationary for the world as a whole while per
   capita CO2 is found to be regime-wise trend stationary. The analysis of
   country-groups shows that for Africa and Asia, per capita CO2 is best
   described as nonstationary, while per capita GDP appears stationary
   around a broken trend. In addition, we find evidence of regime-wise
   trend stationarity in both variables for the country-groups consisting
   of America, Europe and Oceania. The results of our analysis carry
   important implications for the statistical modelling of the
   Environmental Kuznets curve for CO2, since the differing order of
   integration in both variables for the world as a whole and for Africa
   and Asia calls into question the validity of panel cointegration
   techniques which assume that both variables are nonstationary and
   cointegrated with one another. Cointegration techniques would not be
   appropriate either for the case of America, Europe and Oceania which are
   characterised by per capita GDP and CO2 emissions being stationary
   around a broken trend. Similar conclusions are reached when we analyse
   country-groups based on levels of development. Failure to properly
   characterise the time series properties of the data by not controlling
   for an unknown number of structural breaks and for cross-sectional
   dependence could be responsible for the fragility and lack of robustness
   surrounding the estimation of environmental Kuznets curves. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{We present a proposal for a standardized method to develop restoration
   practices capable of increasing the efficacy of landscape management and
   create the necessary bridge between restoration planning and landscape
   ecology. This methodology was developed in order to identify the
   reference landscape and to define areas within that landscape that
   possess different degrees of potential for restoration purposes in a
   cultural landscape. We utilized retrospective data to compare former
   ecosystem arrangements, taking into account ecological, spatial and
   temporal issues, such as historical information on changes in land use,
   in addition to diachronically analyzed aerial photos taken between 1954
   and 2002, using an object-based approach. The test area is a Nature
   Reserve in Tuscany (Italy) that preserves the cultural landscape of
   biancane badlands - erosion forms generated on Plio-Pleistocene marine
   clay outcrops - which is characterized by a high erosion rate. In the
   first step, a land cover map was obtained by image segmentation on the
   1954 photographs and the patches classified as ``target habitats{''}
   were used as a selection mask on the 2002 image. As a second step, a
   more detailed land cover map was created for the areas selected as masks
   in the previous step. Hence, the target habitats that showed stability
   (persistence) between the two dates were excluded from the analysis, as
   well as the land cover classes not suitable for restoration
   (broad-leaved forests, arable land, artificial and other agricultural
   areas). The selected sites, covered by four vegetation types in the 2002
   land cover map, accounted for approximately 91 ha. The method focuses on
   selecting sites for restoration in order to reduce efforts and negative

Abstract = {{We investigated the impact of climate change in the Aral Sea basin
   (Central Asia) using long term observational time series of three
   indicators - air temperature, precipitation, and change in river
   discharge. For each indicator data of approximately 200 measurement
   locations (hydrological and meteorological stations) were considered.
   Changes and trends in the data were identified using statistical methods
   and modeling. Missing data in individual time series were estimated
   using correlations between related stations.
   The results show that the annual air temperature in Central Asia started
   to increase considerably after 1950. The time series of mean annual
   temperatures show trends of increasing temperatures of varying
   magnitude. At some stations temperature trends are affected by human
   activities, especially in the vicinity of larger cities. On the
   contrary, no trends in precipitation or an increase in the amount of
   precipitation could be detected in the Central Asian region. No relation
   between precipitation and temperature increase could be detected.
   Increasing temperatures accelerate the degradation of glacier fields in
   the Pamir and Tian Shan mountains which are a major source of river
   runoff in Central Asia. The reduction in glacier area and changes in
   precipitation patterns will alter the flow regime of the rivers - a fact
   that has been stated before. In this article we present an assessment of
   the magnitude of the expected changes based on available climate related
   data and provide examples of the implications of climate change on the
   flow regime of the river. Analysis of river runoff time series revealed
   that total runoff has so far changed only little. However, the shape of
   the hydrograph has changed, which will have strong impacts on the main
   water users, especially irrigated agriculture.
   Given the observed and expected impact of climate change in the Aral Sea
   Basin and the large uncertainties of predicting future river runoff the
   paper concludes that new water management approaches are needed that can
   cope with increasing variability and uncertainty in water availability
   and their consequences for current and future water users.}},

Abstract = {{An improvement in allelopathic potential in rice will have a great
   impact on both low-input and high-input management systems. Alleopathy
   alone is not likely to replace other weed control practices, but it
   surely functions as a component of integrated weed management
   technology. Marginally reduced use of herbicide over time will provide
   significant economical benefits to farmers and will also reduce adverse
   effects on the environment. There is a great possibility of breeding new
   allelopathic rice by regulating their capacity to produce allelopathic
   substances. Allelopathic potential in rice was greatly improved by the
   classical breeding method of crossing between a non-allelopathic
   commercial cultivar and an allelopathic cultivar. The first priority
   research areas are identification of allelochemicals and genes
   responsible for allelopathic effects and these traits can be easily
   incorporated into improved cultivars by either classical breeding or
   biotechnology. Allelopathic activities of rice seem to be derived from
   the joint action of momilactones with phenolic compounds. Phenolics,
   however, are unlikely to be the primary allelochemicals since they never
   reach a phytotoxic level in soil. However, it is believed that phenolics
   like other multiple compounds present at concentrations below the
   activity threshold could have pronounced allelopathic effects through
   their joint action. Momilactone B seems to be the responsible
   allelochemical because its activities were 30-fold to 300-fold greater
   than phenolic acids. Insertion of two specific genes such as CA4H for
   p-coumaric acid and OsDTS2 for momilactone into one commercial rice
   cultivar by biotechnology will lead to the development of allelopathic
   rice cultivar. Further studies on genetic control of rice allelopathy,
   the complete array of the responsible chemicals in rice root exudates
   and their mode of action will shed more light on developing an
   allelopathic rice crop.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1-19}},
Abstract = {{Transgenic crops are new products of agriculture biotechnology. The
   environmental risks and benefits of transgenic crops are topic of hot
   debate. Current agriculture management practices and ecosystems have
   their own impacts on the environment and further any additional negative
   effect of transgenic crops may mitigate their positive impacts as well
   as increase the background value of negative impacts due to new
   agriculture practices. Most of the risk assessment studies on transgenic
   plants have done observations on changes in their respective aboveground
   environment and its biota. Very few reports are available on the impacts
   of transgenic plants or their products (that they release in soil) on
   soil biota (both invertebrates and. microorganisms) and soil processes
   mediated by them. However, observations of these studies were not
   delivering anything conclusively and creating state of confusion also
   regarding impact of transgenic plants on soil ecosystem. As some of the
   studies suggested that If production and release of the transgene
   products from transgenic plants through different routes in soil exceed
   to its consumption/ biodegradation, may lead to their accumulation
   beyond threshold levels, which may have acute as well as chronic effect
   on soil ecosystem. Impacts of transgenic plants are also dependent upon
   spatial and temporal environmental variables. Whereas some of the
   studies observation suggests that transgenic plants don't have any
   negative impact on soil ecosystem. Keeping this status in background we
   prepared this manuscript. Our manuscript is divided in two parts, first
   part comprises review of the available literature on impacts of
   commercialized transgenic plants on soil ecosystem and its diversity,
   and in second part keeping above information as background, a framework
   is proposed for future comparative impact assessment of transgenic
   plants and its non transgenic isoline on soil ecosystem. In this
   approach each transgenic crop along with its non-transgenic isoline
   should be dealt separately according to its construct. The proposed
   approach is precautionary at each step, if there is any doubt at any
   stage they should be clarified by repetition of experiments. This
   approach will be helpful in filling of information gaps, which still
   exists in impact assessment studies of transgenic plants on soil
   ecosystem. This approach suggested monitoring should be carried out
   prior as well as post release of transgenic plants. Impact assessment of
   transgenic plants with respect to soil ecosystem should be made
   mandatory in current regulatory framework of transgenic crops throughout
   the world, to assure the use of transgenic technology without affecting
   the diversity and functioning of soil ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite image-based mapping of tropical forests is vital to
   conservation planning. Standard methods for automated image
   classification, however, limit classification detail in complex tropical
   landscapes. In this study, we test an approach to Landsat image
   interpretation on four islands of the Lesser Antilles, including Grenada
   and St. Kitts, Nevis and St. Eustatius, testing a more detailed
   classification than earlier work in the latter three islands. Secondly,
   we estimate the extents of land cover and protected forest by formation
   for five islands and ask how land cover has changed over the second half
   of the 20(th) century. The image interpretation approach combines image
   mosaics and ancillary geographic data, classifying the resulting set of
   raster data with decision tree software. Cloud-free image mosaics for
   one or two seasons were created by applying regression tree
   normalization to scene dates that could fill cloudy areas in a base
   scene. Such mosaics are also known as cloud-filled, cloud-minimized or
   cloud-cleared imagery, mosaics, or composites. The approach accurately
   distinguished several classes that more standard methods would confuse;
   the seamless mosaics aided reference data collection; and the
   multiseason imagery allowed us to separate drought deciduous forests and
   woodlands from semi-deciduous ones. Cultivated land areas declined 60 to
   100 percent from about 1945 to 2000 on several islands. Meanwhile,
   forest cover has increased 50 to 950\%. This trend will likely continue
   where sugar cane cultivation has dominated. Like the island of Puerto
   Rico, most higher-elevation forest formations are protected in formal or
   informal reserves. Also similarly, lowland forests, which are drier
   forest types on these islands, are not well represented in reserves.
   Former cultivated lands in lowland areas could provide lands for new
   reserves of drier forest types. The land-use history of these islands
   may provide insight for planners in countries currently considering
   lowland forest clearing for agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Animals and plants can transform their body in response to their needs,
   adapting to environmental changes and movement or locomotion. The
   mechanisms of these transformations and deformations can be used for the
   creation of new deployable structures in architecture. The possibilities
   of new synthetic materials enable the architects to apply the natural
   principles in design much more easily than before.
   Today's deployable structures are often made of soft or hard materials.
   New synthetic and composite materials (e.g. glass-reinforced plastic)
   provide the possibility of using elastic materials for new deployable
   structures. The deformation of such structures can be made not only with
   hinges and rollers, but also with the elasticity of materials.
   Answering the question of how it is possible to translate these natural
   mechanisms into architecture is the main focus of this paper. We use
   here the ``abstract formal patterns{''} for representing the natural
   mechanisms. These patterns show the transformation of an organ or a body
   and art; represented by wire-frame models as points, lines and colors.
   We want to present how these models can be used in architecture after
   gradual modifications in different steps.
   We have chosen the body deformation of an ``earthworm{''} as a case
   study in order to explain this method. An earthworm moves by means of
   waves of muscular contractions, which alternately shorten and lengthen
   the body. We present an abstraction of this natural principle and
   development of new deployable structures in architecture by using the

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Fish species have been often used as indicators of environmental quality
   in aquatic ecosystems, while biotic indices based on fish have become
   common tools in ecological monitoring. Nevertheless, such indices are
   far from perfect, mainly because they are based on assumptions that
   sometimes are not met and because they cannot be optimized from a
   computational point of view. As any other method, they rely upon expert
   judgments for selecting relevant metrics, combining metrics into a score
   and defining thresholds between ecological status classes in the scoring
   scale. Provided that no procedure can be entirely objective in
   evaluating ecological status, as this very concept is inherently
   subjective, we propose a novel approach in which the unavoidable
   subjective elements only play a role in the earliest steps, while the
   subsequent optimization of the evaluation procedure is as objective as
   possible. An expert system, designed after this concept for Latium
   (Central Italy) river basins and based on a multilayer perceptron neural
   network, was developed and implemented into a Graphical User Interface
   (GUI) in order to make it easily accessible to non-technical users. The
   neural network reconstructs experts' judgments on the basis of a set of
   abiotic descriptors and fish assemblage composition, thus providing
   consensus estimates of ecological status for any river stretch. This
   approach allows easily the incorporation into the expert system of new
   data and new expert judgments as soon as they become available. However,
   the very first version of the expert system is already able to correctly
   classify 2 out of 3 cases, while the worst classification error does not
   exceed a single class of ecological status. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

   Information}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystem regime shifts, which are long-term system reorganizations,
   have profound implications for sustainability. There is a great need for
   indicators of regime shifts, particularly methods that are applicable to
   data from real systems. We have developed a form of Fisher information
   that measures dynamic order in complex systems. Here we propose the use
   of Fisher information as a means of: (1) detecting dynamic regime shifts
   in ecosystems, and (2) assessing the quality of the shift in terms of
   intensity and pervasiveness. Intensity is reflected by the degree of
   change in dynamic order, as determined by Fisher information, and
   pervasiveness is a reflection of how many observable variables are
   affected by the change. We present a new robust methodology to calculate
   Fisher information from time series field data. We demonstrate the use
   of Fisher information to detect regime shifts on a model for a shallow
   lake. Next, we use Fisher information to analyze marine ecosystem
   response to physical changes using real time-series data of a coastal

Abstract = {{The effect of climate change and the growing world population are
   together increasing both the chance of flooding and the consequences.
   There is mounting recognition that reliance on structural flood defences
   alone may be neither sufficient nor sustainable in the long term,
   particularly in low lands.
   In Italy, in the wake of the floods that plagued the northern part of
   the country in the fifties and sixties, a process was set in motion
   aimed at developing a new integrated approach to water management, at
   the catchment level, suitable for coping with water related disasters.
   In this context, three case-studies of flood risk management and hazard
   assessment are featured: two related to the Po catchment and the last to
   the Basento river in the Basilicata Region. After describing the
   methodologies, which differ in the application effort required and in
   the accuracy expected, the paper focuses on both the results achieved
   and the reliability of the procedures applied. Management issues are
   approached under four general headings: planning, technical, operational
   and institutional. Although the cases differ with respect to the
   flooding problems they encounter, some common issues emerged: the
   challenge of translating a riskbased approach on a basin-wide level into
   concrete measures, harmonizing flood-risk management policy with spatial
   planning and institutional cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{A global assessment of desertification undertaken by the Millennium
   Ecosystem Assessment (MA) shows that desertification in drylands
   threatens the homes and livelihoods of millions of poor. Environmental
   impacts of desertification are further exacerbated by political
   marginalization of the dryland poor and the slow growth of health and
   education infrastructures. The MA report also highlights the global
   nature of the environmental and social challenges posed by
   desertification. The impacts on the global environment - increasing dust
   storms, floods and global warming - are well known and documented. Less
   well-known are the strong impacts of desertification on societies and
   economies, notably those related to human migration and economic
   refugees. The MA report points to a variety of integrated policy options
   to reverse the decline of drylands while optimizing economic output, and
   emphasizes the inclusion of these in the mainstream national strategies
   for poverty reduction.
   The MA report suggests that full understanding of the significance of
   desertification is constrained by many uncertainties regarding the
   relationships among desertification, climate change, biodiversity,
   ecosystem services and human wellbeing. To counter these uncertainties,
   we need to significantly improve and document our knowledge of the
   interactions between socio-economic factors and ecosystem conditions. A
   framework developed by a group of UN agencies provides the underpinnings
   for improved management of scientific knowledge and monitoring - leading
   to improved understanding of the human-ecosystem interactions. The
   framework is part of a new initiative to evaluate the global
   environmental benefits of combating land degradation. While building on
   the conceptual approach espoused by the MA, this initiative aspires to
   develop a knowledge management network for issues relevant to land
   degradation, including desertification and deforestation.}},

Abstract = {{Aim By dissolving natural physical barriers to movement, human-mediated
   species introductions have dramatically reshuffled the present-day
   biogeography of freshwater fishes. The present study investigates
   whether the antiquity of Australia's freshwater ichthyofauna has been
   altered by the widespread invasion of non-indigenous fish species.
   Location Australia.
   Methods Using fish presence-absence data for historical and present-day
   species pools, we quantified changes in faunal similarity among major
   Australian drainage divisions and among river basins of north-eastern
   Australia according to the Sorensen index, and related these changes to
   major factors of catchment disturbance that significantly alter river
   processes.
   Results Human-mediated fish introductions have increased faunal
   similarity among primary drainages by an average of 3.0\% (from 17.1\%
   to 20.1\% similarity). Over three-quarters of the pairwise changes in
   drainage similarity were positive, indicating a strong tendency for
   taxonomic homogenization caused primarily by the widespread introduction
   of Carassius auratus, Gambusia holbrooki, Oncorhynchus mykiss and
   Poecilia reticulata. Faunal homogenization was highest in drainages
   subjected to the greatest degree of disturbance associated with human
   settlement, infrastructure and change in land use. Scenarios of future
   species invasions and extinctions indicate the continued homogenization
   of Australian drainages. In contrast, highly idiosyncratic introductions
   of species in river basins of north-eastern Australia have decreased
   fish faunal similarity by an average of 1.4\%.
   Main conclusions We found that invasive species have significantly
   changed the present-day biogeography of fish by homogenizing Australian
   drainages and differentiating north-eastern river basins. Decreased
   faunal similarity at smaller spatial scales is a result of high
   historical similarity in this region and reflects the dynamic nature of
   the homogenization process whereby sporadic introductions of new species
   initially decrease faunal similarity across basins. Our study points to
   the importance of understanding the role of invasive species in defining
   patterns of present-day biogeography and preserving the antiquity of
   Australia's freshwater biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach to population-level assessment was applied in order to
   demonstrate its utility in estimating and managing the risk of zinc in a
   water environment. Much attention has been paid to population-level risk
   assessment, but there have been no attempts to determine a safe
   population-level concentration as an environmental criterion. Based on
   the published results of toxicity tests for various species, we first
   theoretically derived a threshold concentration at which a population
   size is unchanged due to the adverse effects of zinc exposure. To derive
   a zinc concentration that will protect populations in natural
   environments, we adopted the concept of species sensitivity
   distribution. Assuming the threshold concentrations of a set of species
   are log-normally distributed, we calculated the 95\% protection level of
   zinc (PHC5 :population-level hazardous concentration of 5\% of species),
   which is 107 mu g/L. Meanwhile, the 95\% protection criterion (HC5)
   based on conventional individual-level chronic toxicity, was calculated
   to be 14.6 mu g/L. The environmentally safe concentration for a
   population-level endpoint is about 7 times greater than that for an
   individual-level endpoint. The proposed method provides guidance for a
   pragmatic approach to population-level ecological risk assessment and
   the management of chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To assess the genetic and archaeological evidence for the migration
   of modern humans out of Africa to the circum-Pacific region and compare
   the migration patterns with Late Pleistocene and Holocene changes in sea
   level and climate.
   Location Southern and eastern Asia, Australia, and Oceania.
   Methods Review of the literature and detailed compilations of data on
   early human settlements, sea level, and climate change.
   Results The expansion of modern humans out of Africa, following a
   coastal route into southern Asia, was initially thwarted by a series of
   large and abrupt environmental changes. A period of relatively stable
   climate and sea level from c. 45,000 yr BP to 40,000 yr BP supported a
   rapid coastal expansion of modern humans throughout much of Southeast
   Asia, enabling them to reach the coasts of northeast Russia and Japan by
   38,000-37,000 yr BP. Further northwards, migrations were delayed by cold
   northern climates, which began to deteriorate rapidly after 33,000 yr
   BP. Human migrations along the coast of the Bering Sea into the New
   World appear to have occurred much later, c. 14,000 yr BP, probably by
   people from central Asia who were better adapted to cold northern
   climates. Cold, dry climates and rapidly changing sea levels leading
   into and out of the Last Glacial Maximum inhibited coastal settlement,
   and many of the sites occupied prior to 33,000 yr BP were abandoned.
   After 16,000 yr BP, the sea-level rise slowed enough to permit coastal
   ecosystems to develop and coasts to be re-colonized, but abrupt changes
   in climate and sea level inhibited this development until after 12,000
   yr BP. Between 12,000 yr BP and 7000 yr BP there was a dramatic increase
   in reef and estuary/lagoon ecosystems, concurrent with a major expansion
   of coastal settlements. This early Holocene increase in coastal
   environments and the concomitant expansion of human coastal-resource
   exploitation were followed by corresponding declines in both phenomena
   in the mid-Holocene, c. 6000-4000 yr BP. This decline in coastal
   resources is linked to the drop in sea level throughout the Pacific,
   which may have caused the widespread population dislocations that
   ultimately led to the human expansion throughout Oceania.
   Main conclusions Climate and sea-level changes played a central role in
   the peopling of the circum-Pacific region.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To address the hypothesis that there has been a substantial increase
   in woody vegetation cover ('vegetation thickening') during the 100 years
   after the burning practices of aboriginal hunter-gatherers were abruptly
   replaced by the management activities associated with pastoralism in
   north-east Australia.
   Location Three hundred and eighty-three sites on 3000 km transect,
   inland Queensland, Australia.
   Methods Vegetation structure descriptions from the route notes of the
   first European exploration of the location by Ludwig Leichhardt in
   1844-45 were georeferenced and compiled. Leichhardt's application of
   structural descriptors (e.g. `scrub', `open forest', `plain') was
   interpreted as domains within a matrix of tall stratum and low stratum
   woody cover. Woody cover was also interpreted for the same locations
   using aerial photography that largely pre-dates extensive land clearing
   (1940s-1970s) and compared with their structural domain in 1844-45. The
   fire-sensitive tree, cypress-pine (Callitris glaucophylla) was singled
   out for case study because it has been widely proposed that the density
   of this tree has substantially increased under European pastoral
   management.
   Results The coarse resolution of this analysis indicates that the
   structure of the vegetation has been stable over the first 100 years of
   pastoralism. For example treeless or sparsely treed plains described by
   Leichhardt (1844-45) had the same character on the aerial photography
   (1945-78). Leichhardt typically described vegetation that includes
   cypress-pine as having a `thicket' structure suggesting dense
   regenerating stands of small trees, consistent with the signature
   typical on the aerial photography.
   Main conclusions A large data set of geographically located descriptions
   of vegetation structure from the first European traverse of inland
   Australia compared with vegetation structure determined from aerial
   photography does not support the hypothesis that vegetation thickening
   has been extensive and substantial. On the contrary the study suggests
   that the structure of the vegetation has been relatively stable for the
   first 100 years of European settlement and pastoralism except for those
   areas that have been affected by broad-scale clearing.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{13-17}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Many studies have searched for traits that characterize successful
   invaders. Unfortunately, very few generalizations have emerged from this
   work. It seems that the traits of successful invaders are idiosyncratic
   and context-dependent. Unless we are to study each potential invader in
   each possible target community individually, we will need a new
   approach.
   2. We introduce a framework for predicting traits that are likely to
   confer success in a given ecosystem. Our approach considers the
   prevailing environmental conditions, the traits of resident species, and
   the traits of potentially invading species.
   3. Our approach can be applied to ecosystems where the environmental
   conditions and/or disturbance regime have recently changed, to predict
   the range of trait space occupied by (i) native species at risk of local
   extinction, (ii) native species that can persist under the present
   conditions, and (iii) successful invaders. Our approach can also be used
   to identify unoccupied viable trait space (i.e. vacant niches) that
   might be at risk of invasion.
   4. Synthesis. Understanding invasions resulting from rapid changes in
   environmental conditions and invasions resulting from the colonization
   of vacant niches would be a major step forward for invasion biology. The
   conceptual framework described here is not limited to plant invasions:
   the same approach can be used for any taxa (e.g. insects, fish, mammals
   and marine invertebrates) and could also be used to predict species
   responses to environmental change.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{366}},
Pages = {{175-186}},
Abstract = {{This study provides a baseline measure of pelagic fish species diversity
   around fish aggregating devices (FADs) in the Western Indian Ocean.
   Using data from visual censuses made by SCUBA divers around drifting
   FADs we (1) analysed 11 diversity indices describing 4 main components
   of pelagic diversity: number of species, evenness, taxonomic diversity
   and rarity and (2) discussed the viability of using visual censuses
   around FADs to monitor temporal and spatial changes in diversity
   patterns of pelagic fishes in the future. Our results not only show that
   a single index, such as species richness or the Shannon-Wiener index,
   cannot provide a complete description of pelagic fish diversity around
   FADs, but also that some components of diversity appear to be
   multifaceted themselves and require the simultaneous use of several
   complementary indices in order to be accurately described and monitored.
   Despite a limited sampling effort, our results suggest that using visual
   censuses around FADs could provide reproducible `relative' indices of
   diversity for a well-delimited assemblage of species (intra- and
   extranatant species in the epipelagic domain). In this context, we
   propose a preliminary `short list' of diversity indices based firstly on
   their complementarity and secondly on their simplicity. While visual
   censuses of pelagic fishes at FADs (like any other sampling method)
   cannot give an exhaustive picture of diversity, they are a
   fishery-independent survey method that can complement other sampling
   techniques and provide reproducible information to monitor the diversity
   of these very difficult-to-access pelagic fish communities.}},

Abstract = {{Competition is a key process in plant populations and communities. We
   thus need, if we are to predict the responses of ecological systems to
   environmental change, a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of
   plant competition. Considering competition, however, only at the
   population level is not sufficient because plant individuals usually are
   different, interact locally, and can adapt their behaviour to the
   current state of themselves and of their biotic and abiotic environment.
   Therefore, simulation models that are individual-based and spatially
   explicit are increasingly used for studying competition in plant
   systems. Many different individual-based modelling approaches exist to
   represent competition, but it is not clear how good they are in
   reflecting essential aspects of plant competition. We therefore first
   summarize current concepts and theories addressing plant competition.
   Then, we review individual-based approaches for modelling competition
   among plants. We distinguish between approaches that are used for more
   than 10 years and more recent ones. We identify three major gaps that
   need to be addressed more in the future: the effects of plants on their
   local environment, adaptive behaviour, and below-ground competition. To
   fill these gaps, the representation of plants and their interactions
   have to be more mechanistic than most existing approaches. Developing
   such new approaches is a challenge because they are likely to be more
   complex and to require more detailed knowledge and data on
   individual-level processes underlying competition. We thus need a more
   integrated research strategy for the future, where empirical and
   theoretical ecologists as well as computer scientists work together on
   formulating, implementing, parameterization, testing, comparing, and
   selecting the new approaches. (c) 2008 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades it has become increasingly obvious that
   disturbance, whether natural or anthropogenic in origin, is ubiquitous
   in ecosystems. Disturbance-related processes are now considered to be
   important determinants of the composition, structure and function of
   ecological systems. However, because disturbance and succession
   processes occur across a wide range of spatio-temporal scales their
   empirical investigation is difficult. To counter these difficulties much
   use has been made of spatial modelling to explore the response of
   ecological systems to disturbance(s) occurring at spatial scales from
   the individual to the landscape and above, and temporal scales from
   minutes to centuries. Here we consider such models by contrasting two
   alternative motivations for their development and use: prediction and
   exploration, with a focus on forested ecosysterns. We consider the two
   approaches to be complementary rather than competing. Predictive
   modelling aims to combine knowledge (understanding and data) with the
   goal of predicting system dynamics; conversely, exploratory models focus
   on developing understanding in systems where uncertainty is high.
   Examples of exploratory modelling include model-based explorations of
   generic issues of criticality in ecological systems, whereas predictive
   models tend to be more heavily data-driven (e.g. species distribution
   models). By considering predictive and exploratory modelling alongside
   each other, we aim to illustrate the range of methods used to model
   succession and disturbance dynamics and the challenges involved in the
   model-building and evaluation processes in this arena. (c) 2007 Rubel

Abstract = {{Moisture deteriorates buildings materials. It causes physical, chemical
   and biological damages. Moist materials are susceptible for corrosion,
   provide suitable conditions for microbe growth and have diminished
   thermal insulation properties. If condensed vapor in porous spaces
   freezes it can destroy the structure of material. New buildings are
   designed to prevent water transport and vapour condensation in the
   building barriers. But there still exist many old or historical
   buildings which require renovation. In this case, the knowledge of
   moisture content is necessary because high moisture levels change
   physical properties of the materials and the measurement should be
   possible in almost all zones of the barriers. The simplest one is the
   gravimetrical measurement method. This is a destructive method because
   it requires cutting the samples from the building barriers. This
   underlines the necessity to develop a simple and non-destructive
   measurement method that allows measurement in wide range of humidity.
   Such method is adopted from agrotechnic measurement. Thermocouple
   psychrometry is a technique that determines the water potential of
   liquid phase of porous buildings materials. To run the water potential
   measurement experiment, the psychrometer probe must be placed in a
   drilled hole. After attaining the temperature and the vapor pressure
   equilibrium between the the air in porous material and the space
   surrounding the probe, a series of measurement procedures must be
   followed. Very sensitive microvoltometer is required to make voltage
   drop readings from the thermocouple. Experiments made prove that the
   thermocouple psychrometry measurement of water potential is a very
   accurate method and permits to get stable and repeatable results.
   Relative humidity can be determined in range between 90 and 99\%. This
   method is also very flexible because it gives the opportunity to make
   measurements in a wide range of temperatures and then compare the
   results to the standard temperature after simple conversion. All this
   advantages make thermocouple psychrometry a very useful method of
   relative humidity determination in laboratory and field measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of rare and declining species is one of the most important
   tasks of wildlife managers. Here we present a large-scale, long-term
   monitoring program for Olympic marmot (Marmota olympus) throughout its
   range across a logistically challenging mountainous park. Our
   multiple-stage process of survey design accounts for the difficulty
   imposed by access to remote habitats and funding constraints. The
   Olympic marmot is endemic to the Olympic Mountains, Washington State,
   USA. Although nearly all of its range is enclosed within Olympic
   National Park, declines and local extirpations of the species have been
   documented. We considered several possible alternative survey
   approaches, and propose a monitoring program designed to reflect
   extinction-recolonisation dynamics using presence-absence data. The
   sampling design is based on annual surveys of a set of at least 25
   randomly selected clusters ( closely located groups of sites with record
   of current or historical occupancy by marmots), and supplemented by
   sampling 15 never-occupied sites to test for new colonisations. The
   monitoring plan provides a framework that park managers can use for
   assessing changes over time in Olympic marmot distribution across the
   range of the species. Our sampling design may serve as a useful case
   study for establishing monitoring programs for other species with

Abstract = {{External (i.e. point source and tributary) phosphorus loads are an
   appropriate target for lake managers concerned with eutrophication
   control. However, internal loads associated with phosphorus that has
   accumulated in lake sediments can retard the response to reductions in
   external loading. This paper describes the development, calibration,
   confirmation and application of a model for phosphorus exchange at the
   sediment-water interface of a eutrophic, urban system, Onondaga Lake,
   New York. The model is based on the principles of mass balance and
   accommodates the delivery of labile particulate phosphorus to the
   sediment surface, diagenesis of that phosphorus within the sediment
   (conversion to the soluble form), redox-mediated adsorption and
   desorption, and diffusion and release of soluble phosphorus to the water
   column. Values for most model inputs and coefficients were determined
   through a suite of field and laboratory measurements and
   experimentation, establishing the credibility of the tool for
   site-specific application. The model was calibrated to measured sediment
   profiles of soluble and labile particulate phosphorus, limiting
   coefficient adjustment to experimentally defined bounds. The
   confirmation process included comparison of model-predicted and measured
   rates of sediment phosphorus release with no further coefficient
   adjustment.
   The model was then applied in the prediction of the sediment response to
   changes in the phosphorus content of sedimenting particulate matter,
   changes which would accompany reductions in external phosphorus loads to
   the lake. It is demonstrated that steady state rates of sediment
   phosphorus release, i.e. those in equilibrium with newly established
   rates of labile particulate phosphorus deposition, are achieved over a
   period of 19-26 years. These findings have important implications with
   respect to the natural recovery of eutrophic systems and will assist
   water quality managers in developing appropriate public expectations for
   the timing of lake restoration. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The dynamics of landscape change are closely linked to the dynamics of
   land tenure-the societal institutions (organizations, rules, fights and
   restrictions) that control the allocation and use of land and its
   associated resources by people. Land tenure occurs over a characteristic
   set of spatial and temporal scales. Understanding the nature of
   variation in land tenure in space and time is an important step towards
   developing a deeper understanding of land tenure change and its impacts
   on societies and ecosystems. In this paper we develop a new method of
   characterizing and exploring spatial and temporal variation in land
   tenure, focusing on the potential for dynamic feedbacks between
   variation in space and variation in time. The primary objective of this
   research is to develop a robust set of methods that can be used to make
   inferences about pattern-process linkages across multiple scales in
   landscapes that contain interlinked social and ecological systems. We
   apply our approach to the analysis of a 30-year data set of land
   ownership in part of Hamilton County (north central Florida) and find
   strong evidence for positive feedbacks between spatial and temporal
   variation. Our results suggest that spatial and temporal variation in
   land tenure interact strongly, raising the interesting possibility that
   strategic purchases of land in ecologically important areas may serve to
   limit habitat fragmentation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.. All rights

Abstract = {{Contact patterns in populations fundamentally influence the spread of
   infectious diseases. Current mathematical methods for epidemiological
   forecasting on networks largely assume that contacts between individuals
   are fixed, at least for the duration of an outbreak. In reality, contact
   patterns may be quite fluid, with individuals frequently making and
   breaking social or sexual relationships. Here, we develop a mathematical
   approach to predicting disease transmission on dynamic networks in which
   each individual has a characteristic behaviour (typical contact number),
   but the identities of their contacts change in time. We show that
   dynamic contact patterns shape epidemiological dynamics in ways that
   cannot be adequately captured in static network models or mass-action
   models. Our new model interpolates smoothly between static network
   models and mass-action models using a mixing parameter, thereby
   providing a bridge between disparate classes of epidemiological models.
   Using epidemiological and sexual contact data from an Atlanta high
   school, we demonstrate the application of this method for forecasting

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The time-of-detection method for aural avian point counts is a new
   method of estimating abundance, allowing for uncertain probability of
   detection. The method has been specifically designed to allow for
   variation in singing rates of birds. It involves dividing the time
   interval of the point count into several subintervals and recording the
   detection history of the subintervals when each bird sings. The method
   can be viewed as generating data equivalent to closed capture-recapture
   information. The method is different from the distance and
   multiple-observer methods in that it is not required that all the birds
   sing during the point count. As this method is new and there is some
   concern as to how well individual birds can be followed, we carried out
   a field test of the method using simulated known populations of singing
   birds, using a laptop computer to send signals to audio stations
   distributed around a point. The system mimics actual aural avian point
   counts, but also allows us to know the size and spatial distribution of
   the populations we are sampling. Fifty 8-min point counts (broken into
   four 2-min intervals) using eight species of birds were simulated.
   Singing rate of an individual bird of a species was simulated following
   a Markovian process (singing bouts followed by periods of silence),
   which we felt was more realistic than a truly random process. The main
   emphasis of our paper is to compare results from species singing at
   (high and low) homogenous rates per interval with those singing at (high
   and low) heterogeneous rates. Population size was estimated accurately
   for the species simulated, with a high homogeneous probability of
   singing. Populations of simulated species with lower but homogeneous
   singing probabilities were somewhat underestimated. Populations of
   species simulated with heterogeneous singing probabilities were
   substantially underestimated. Underestimation was caused by both the
   very low detection probabilities of all distant individuals and by
   individuals with low singing rates also having very low detection
   probabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Customary forms of resource management, such as taboos, have received
   considerable attention as a potential basis for conservation initiatives
   in the Indo-Pacific. Yet little is known about how socioeconomic factors
   influence the ability of communities to use customary management
   practices and whether socioeconomic transformations within communities
   will weaken conservation initiatives with a customary foundation. We
   used a comparative approach to examine how socioeconomic factors may
   influence whether communities use customary fisheries management in
   Papua New Guinea. We examined levels of material wealth (modernization),
   dependence on marine resources, population, and distance to market in 15
   coastal communities. We compared these socioeconomic conditions in 5
   communities that used a customary method of closing their fishing ground
   with 10 communities that did not use this type of management. There were
   apparent threshold levels of dependence on marine resources,
   modernization, distance to markets (< 16.5 km), and population (> 600
   people) beyond which communities did not use customary fisheries
   closures. Nevertheless, economic inequality, rather than mean
   modernization levels seemed to influence the use of closures. Our
   results suggest that customary management institutions are not resilient
   to factors such as population growth and economic modernization. If
   customary management is to be used as a basis for modern conservation
   initiatives, cross-scale institutional arrangements such as networks and

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The concept of resilience is widely promoted as a promising notion to
   guide new approaches to ecosystem and resource management that try to
   enhance a system's capacity to cope with change. A variety of mechanisms
   of resilience specific for different systems have been proposed. In the
   context of resource management those include but are not limited to the
   diversity of response options and flexibility of the social system to
   adaptively respond to changes on an adequate scale. However,
   implementation of resilience-based management in specific real-world
   systems has often proven difficult because of a limited understanding of
   suitable interventions and their impact on the resilience of the coupled
   social-ecological system. We propose an agent-based modeling approach to
   explore system characteristics and mechanisms of resilience in a complex
   resource management system, based on a case study of water use in the
   Amudarya River, which is a semiarid river basin. Water resources in its
   delta are used to sustain irrigated agriculture as well as aquatic
   ecosystems that provide fish and other ecosystem services. The three
   subsystems of the social-ecological system, i.e., the social system, the
   irrigation system, and an aquatic ecosystem, are linked by resource
   flows and the allocation decision making of actors on different levels.
   Simulation experiments are carried out to compare the resilience of
   different institutional settings of water management to changes in the
   variability and uncertainty of water availability. The aim is to
   investigate the influence of ( 1) the organizational structure of water
   management, ( 2) information on water availability, and ( 3) the
   diversity of water uses on the resilience of the system to short and
   long-term water scarcity. In this paper, the model concept and first
   simulation results are presented. As a first illustration of the
   approach the performances of a centralized and a decentralized regime
   are compared under different scenarios of information on water
   availability. Under the given conditions of a regularly fluctuating
   inflow and compliance of agents with orders from a national authority,
   the centralized system performs better as long as irrigation is the only
   type of water use. Diversification of resource use, e. g., irrigation
   and fishing, increases the performance of the decentralized regime and
   the resilience of both. Systematic analysis of the performance of
   different system structures will help to identify properties and
   mechanisms of resilience. This understanding will be valuable for the
   identification, development, and evaluation of management interventions
   in specific river basins.}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The culture trap is the tendency to put cultural markers and habits
   above the demands of reason or compassion. It can reduce receptivity to
   new ideas and trigger Phoenix Cycles of catastrophe and renaissance.
   System research is then complicated by the historiographic problem of
   continuity and change, because there are no objective criteria for
   deciding whether ``the system{''} survived or was destroyed by the
   catastrophe. This paper explores the differences between uncertainty
   emergence and self-organizing emergence using the concept of a
   ``possibility space{''} to clarify the relationship between anti-causal
   events and causal states, i.e., the meso-history of conjuncture.
   Conjunctures are interpreted ex post in the context of deep time. The
   paper distinguishes autopoiesis, i.e., a new instance of a species, from
   elaboration, i.e., the origin of new species. It also describes a
   spectrum ranging from metastability, in which the possibility space is
   time invariant, to innovation, in which the possibility space is a
   synergetic artefact of changing habits and beliefs. Metastable systems
   are computably complex; we can make predictions across the boundaries of
   successive conjunctures, subject to statistical uncertainties.
   Innovative systems are uncomputably complex; although we can make
   predictions within a conjuncture and anticipate bottlenecks, we cannot
   predict beyond the conjuncture because conceptual taxonomies will not be
   conserved. The relationship between adaptive potential and constraint
   remains fundamental, although debates about whether the system is
   resilient are meaningless. System boundaries are artefacts of a dynamic
   consensus. The analytical sciences use methods designed for metastable
   systems, whereas the discursive sciences presume innovation. These
   methods predispose researchers to different space-time perspectives
   that, in turn, make it possible to generalize about their roles in
   different policy arenas. Tensions between analytical and discursive
   scientists become more understandable and manageable if these
   historiographic issues are clarified. The relationship between
   innovation and metastability is illustrated in an appendix on the
   emergence of social complexity in Europe.}},

   present reconstructions of historical fire occurrence using tree ring
   proxies, along with chronologies of tree recruitment, to infer the
   effects of WFU programs on forest structure. Historically, fires burned
   every 6 to 9 years, which moderated tree recruitment. Fire suppression
   policies established in the early 1900s successfully excluded fire and
   allowed for unprecedented tree recruitment. Despite the substantial
   changes in forest structure and composition, the frequency and extent of

Abstract = {{We used a nonintrusive field experiment carried out at six sites - Wales
   (UK), Denmark (DK), the Netherlands (NL), Hungary (HU), Sardinia (Italy
   - IT), and Catalonia (Spain - SP) - along a climatic and latitudinal
   gradient to examine the response of plant species richness and primary
   productivity to warming and drought in shrubland ecosystems. The warming
   treatment raised the plot daily temperature by ca. 1 degrees C, while
   the drought treatment led to a reduction in soil moisture at the peak of
   the growing season that ranged from 26\% at the SP site to 82\% in the
   NL site. During the 7 years the experiment lasted (1999-2005), we used
   the pin-point method to measure the species composition of plant
   communities and plant biomass, litterfall, and shoot growth of the
   dominant plant species at each site. A significantly lower increase in
   the number of species pin-pointed per transect was found in the drought
   plots at the SP site, where the plant community was still in a process
   of recovering from a forest fire in 1994. No changes in species richness
   were found at the other sites, which were at a more mature and stable
   state of succession and, thus less liable to recruitment of new species.
   The relationship between annual biomass accumulation and temperature of
   the growing season was positive at the coldest site and negative at the
   warmest site. The warming treatment tended to increase the aboveground
   net primary productivity (ANPP) at the northern sites. The relationship
   between annual biomass accumulation and soil moisture during the growing
   season was not significant at the wettest sites, but was positive at the
   driest sites. The drought treatment tended to reduce the ANPP in the NL,
   HU, IT, and SP sites. The responses to warming were very strongly
   related to the Gaussen aridity index (stronger responses the lower the
   aridity), whereas the responses to drought were not. Changes in the
   annual aboveground biomass accumulation, litterfall, and, thus, the
   ANPP, mirrored the interannual variation in climate conditions: the most
   outstanding change was a decrease in biomass accumulation and an
   increase in litterfall at most sites during the abnormally hot year of
   2003. Species richness also tended to decrease in 2003 at all sites
   except the cold and wet UK site. Species-specific responses to warming
   were found in shoot growth: at the SP site, Globularia alypum was not
   affected, while the other dominant species, Erica multiflora, grew 30\%
   more; at the UK site, Calluna vulgaris tended to grow more in the
   warming plots, while Empetrum nigrum tended to grow less. Drought
   treatment decreased plant growth in several studied species, although
   there were some species such as Pinus halepensis at the SP site or C.
   vulgaris at the UK site that were not affected. The magnitude of
   responses to warming and drought thus depended greatly on the
   differences between sites, years, and species and these multiple plant
   responses may be expected to have consequences at ecosystem and
   community level. Decreases in biodiversity and the increase in E.
   multiflora growth at the SP site as a response to warming challenge the
   assumption that sensitivity to warming may be less well developed at
   more southerly latitudes; likewise, the fact that one of the studied
   shrublands presented negative ANPP as a response to the 2003 heat wave
   also challenges the hypothesis that future climate warming will lead to
   an enhancement of plant growth and carbon sequestration in temperate
   ecosystems.
   Extreme events may thus change the general trend of increased
   productivity in response to warming n the colder sites.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The flowering plant family Proteaceae is putatively of Gondwanan
   age, with modern and fossil lineages found on all southern continents.
   Here we test whether the present distribution of Proteaceae can be
   explained by vicariance caused by the break-up of Gondwana.
   Location Africa, especially southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand,
   South America, New Caledonia, New Guinea, Southeast Asia, Sulawesi,
   Tasmania.
   Methods We obtained chloroplast DNA sequence data from the rbcL gene,
   the rbcL-atpB spacer, and the atpB gene from leaf samples of forty-five
   genera collected from the field and from living collections. We analysed
   these data using Bayesian phylogenetic and molecular dating methods,
   with five carefully selected fossil calibration points to obtain age
   estimates for the nodes within the family.
   Results Four of eight trans-continental disjunctions of sister groups
   within our sample of the Proteaceae post-date the break-up of Gondwana.
   These involve independent lineages, two with an Africa-Australia
   disjunction, one with an Africa-South America disjunction, and one with
   a New Zealand-Australasia disjunction. The date of the radiation of the
   bird-pollinated Embothriinae corresponds approximately to the
   hypothesized date of origin of nectar-feeding birds in Australia.
   Main conclusions The findings suggest that disjunct distributions in
   Proteaceae result from both Gondwanan vicariance and transoceanic
   dispersal. Our results imply that ancestors of some taxa dispersed
   across oceans rather than rafting with Gondwanan fragments as previously
   thought. This finding agrees with other studies of Gondwanan plants in
   dating the divergence of Australian, New Zealand and New Caledonian taxa
   in the Eocene, consistent with the existence of a shared, ancestral
   Eocene flora but contrary to a vicariance scenario based on accepted
   geological knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To examine the distribution and structure of genetic variation among
   native Spartina alterniflora and to characterize the evolutionary
   mechanisms underlying the success of non-native S. alterniflora.
   Location Intertidal marshes along the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts
   of North America.
   Methods amova, parsimony analysis, haplotype networks of chloroplast DNA
   (cpDNA) sequences, neighbour-joining analysis, Bayesian analysis of
   population structure, and individual assignment testing were used.
   Results Low levels of gene flow and geographic patterns of genetic
   variation were found among native S. alterniflora from the Atlantic and
   Gulf coasts of North America. The distribution of cpDNA haplotypes
   indicates that Atlantic coast S. alterniflora are subdivided into
   `northern' and `southern' groups. Variation observed at microsatellite
   loci further suggests that mid-Atlantic S. alterniflora are
   differentiated from S. alterniflora found in southern Atlantic and New
   England coastal marshes. Comparisons between native populations on the
   Atlantic and Gulf coasts and non-native Pacific coast populations
   substantiate prior studies demonstrating reciprocal interspecific
   hybridization in San Francisco Bay. Our results corroborate historical
   evidence that S. alterniflora was introduced into Willapa Bay from
   multiple source populations. However, we found that some Willapa Bay S.
   alterniflora are genetically divergent from putative sources, probably
   as a result of admixture following secondary contact among previously
   allopatric native populations. We further recovered evidence in support
   of models suggesting that S. alterniflora has secondarily spread within
   Washington State, from Willapa Bay to Grays Harbor.
   Main conclusions Underlying genetic structure has often been cited as a
   factor contributing to ecological variation of native S. alterniflora.
   Patterns of genetic structure within native S. alterniflora may be the
   result of environmental differences among biogeographical provinces, of
   migration barriers, or of responses to historical conditions.
   Interactions among these factors, rather than one single factor, may
   best explain the distribution of genetic variation among native S.
   alterniflora. Comprehensive genetic comparisons of native and introduced
   populations can illustrate how biological invasions may result from
   dramatically different underlying factors - some of which might
   otherwise go unrecognized. Demonstrating that invasions can result from
   several independent or interacting mechanisms is important for improving
   risk assessment and future forecasting. Further research on S.
   alterniflora not only may clarify what forces structure native
   populations, but also may improve the management of nonnative
   populations by enabling post-introduction genetic changes and the rapid
   evolution of life-history traits to be more successfully exploited.}},

   Results Our analyses show that all families except the Laurasian

   Pettalidae is restricted to temperate Gondwana, Neogoveidae to tropical
   Gondwana, Stylocellidae to Southeast Asia, and Troglosironidae to New

Abstract = {{The utility of hydropsychid (Trichoptera:Hydropsychidae) caddisfly
   larvae for freshwater biomonitoring has been demonstrated, but the major
   impediment to its implementation has been the lack of species-level
   larval descriptions and illustrations. A rapid and reliable molecular
   protocol that also uses morphology is proposed because conventional
   approaches to associating undescribed larvae with adults have been slow
   and problematic. Male adults were identified before DNA sequence
   analyses were used. These identifications established morphospecies
   boundaries that were mapped on phylograms constructed from 2 independent
   gene fragments: mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and
   large subunit (28S) nuclear ribosomal DNA expansion fragment D2 (D2).
   Species boundaries were confirmed if they were monophyletic on both
   molecular phylograms. Larval associations were made with reference to
   the phylogenetic analyses under 2 criteria: sequence identity across
   both genes or nested placement within a reference species boundary. A
   total of 133 individuals belonging to Chinese Hydropsyche sensu lato
   group (including Hydropsyche {[}Hydropsyche], Hydropsyche
   {[}Occutanspsyche], Ceratopsyche, Mexipsyche, Hydatomanicus, and
   Herbertorossia) were included in our study to test the new protocol. D2
   sequences (all individuals) and COI sequences (101 individuals) were
   obtained, and 2 independent phylograms were constructed using neighbor
   joining. Both fragments provided enough nucleotide changes to
   differentiate independently most Hydropsyche sensu lato species, with
   ambiguity in only a few species that eventually could be resolved with
   additional sequences and specimens. COI diverges significantly within
   some species, suggesting a need for caution when applying typical
   genetic divergence thresholds in species diagnoses. The study enabled us
   to establish a procedure for delimiting species boundaries and
   associating larvae and adults using DNA sequences and morphological
   evidence. Ideal sampling strategies for larval-adult association are
   suggested. Associating larvae and adults of hydropsychids using DNA
   sequences appears to be promising in terms of both reliability and

Abstract = {{Question: What are the effects of fire in native shrubland communities
   and in pine plantations established in these shrublands?
   Location: Northern Patagonia, Argentina.
   Methods: We surveyed four sites in Chall-Huaco valley, located in
   northwest Patagonia. Each site was a vegetation mosaic composed of an
   unburned Pinus ponderosa plantation, a plantation burned in 1996, and an
   unburned matorral and a matorral burned by the same fire. We recorded
   the cover of all vascular plant species. We also analysed species
   richness, total cover, proportion of exotic species, abundance of woody
   species and herb species, cover of exotic species, abundance of woody
   and herb species and differences in composition of species. For both
   shrubs and tree species we recorded the main strategy of regeneration (
   by resprouting or by seed).
   Results: We found that fire had different effects on native matorral and
   pine plantations. Five years after fire, plantations came to be
   dominated by herbs and exotic species, showing differences in floristic
   composition. In contrast, matorral communities remained very similar to
   unburned matorral in terms of species richness, proportion of woody
   species, and herb species and proportion of exotics. Also, pine
   plantations were primarily colonized by seedlings, while matorrals were
   primarily colonized by resprouting.
   Conclusions: Matorrals are highly fire resilient communities, and the
   practice of establishing plantations on matorrals produces a strong
   reduction in the capacity of matorral to return to its original state.
   The elimination of shrubs owing to the effect of plantations can hinder
   regeneration of native ecosystems. Burned plantations may slowly develop
   into ecosystems similar to the native ones, or they may produce a new
   ecosystem dominated by exotic herbs. This study shows that plantations
   of exotic conifers affect native vegetation even after they have been
   removed, as in this case by fire.}},

   Wisconsin, in an effort to enhance the production of waterfowl and other
   wetland associated species. During summer 2004, we re-examined I I
   restorations to determine how their plant communities had changed since
   1992. In addition, we re-evaluated waterfowl and anuran communities at

   only two wetlands. Significant decreases in plant diversity and plant
   species richness were detected between 1992 and 2004, while significant
   increases were detected for species classified as obligate or
   facultative wet. These changes suggest that the plant communities at the
   restorations have matured since 1992. Use of the wetlands by waterfowl
   and anurans, on the other hand, did not exhibit significant change over

Abstract = {{Six commonly used coral reef survey methods, mapping of 1 m x 1 m
   quadrats (MAP), line-point transect (LPT), line-intercept transect
   (LIT), video sampling (VIDEO) and 1 m x 1 m photo-quadrats analysed by
   point-sampling (PHOTP) or by outlining coral colonies (PHOTS), were
   compared for their accuracy and precision in recording benthic substrate
   cover, and for their time-and cost-efficiency. Sampling was carried out
   along a 50 in transect at Ras Urn Sidd, South Sinai, Egypt. For abundant
   substrate categories (>10\% cover) few significant differences were
   recorded between the results obtained by the different methods. Detailed
   mapping of quadrats (MAP) along the entire length of the transect served
   as the baseline against which the results of other methods were
   evaluated. Compared to this, VIDEO provided the most accurate cover
   estimates of major benthic substrate categories. Both line-transect
   methods, LIT and LPT, overestimated the cover of some categories, while
   PHOTP and PHOTS underestimated them. A series of factors seemed to be
   responsible for the differences in the substrate cover values obtained
   using different methods, including contour effects, proportion of
   substrate sampled, view angle, image resolution and observer bias. Power
   analysis indicated that the sample sizes required to yield an 80\%
   chance of detecting even a 20\% relative difference in total hard coral
   cover (e.g. between sites or times) were 27 mapped quadrats, or 1200
   points for LPT, or 135 m of LIT, or 116 frames with 15 points for VIDEO,
   or 38 photo-quadrats for PHOTP and 33 for PHOTS; these are sample sizes
   considerably in excess of those commonly used by most reef workers. Much
   greater sample sizes are required to detect similar differences in cover
   of individual coral growth forms or taxa. When the time taken to record
   and analyse these data is considered, relative cost-efficiency in terms
   of time required by the different methods to detect this level of change
   was found to be VIDEO > PHOTP > PHOTS > LPT > MAP > LIT. Where, in more
   detailed studies, information is also required on numbers and sizes of
   colonies or on processes causing change, use of photo-quadrats may be
   preferred. A new protocol, recording 0.25 m x 0.25 m mini-quadrats with
   modem underwater digital still camera, is proposed, as combining this
   advantage of photo-quadrats with the sampling power of VIDEO. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{A process-based approach to spatially distributed, overland-flow
   modelling is employed to as by assess the impact of water and nutrient
   redistribution at the landscape scale caused by short, high-intensity
   rainstorm e vents across grassland-shrubland vegetation boundaries of a
   semi-arid ecosystem in the south-western United States. The modelling
   scenarios showed that simulated fluxes from shrubland into grassland
   lead to a gain of water resources but to a loss of nutrient resources in
   the grassland areas close to the boundary. Simulated fluxes from
   grasslands into shrublands do not lead to a gain of water resources, but
   to an increase of nutrient resources for thee shrubland are as close to
   the boundary. On the basis of the modelling results, a new hypothesis
   for the on-going desertification process in the south-westesern United
   States is proposed. It is hypothesised that a vegetation boundary is
   stable when two conditions prevail to balance the lower resistance of
   grassland within the existing environmental setting with the higher
   resistance of shrubland: that the depletion of soil nutrients by the
   action of overland flow in the grassland zone close to the boundary is
   in balance with the replenishment rates of grassland by other nutrient
   cycling, and that the grassland gains enough water resources from the
   upslope shrublands. In contrast, a vegetation boundary potentially
   becomes unstable when the grassland acquires a competitive disadvantage
   towards shrubland regarding water benefit and nutrient depletion due to
   the combined effects of overland-flow dynamics and some external forces
   such as extensive overgrazing or climate change. The modelling results
   suggest that landscape linkages through the redistribution of water and
   soil resources across vegetation-transition zones at the landscape scale
   and feedback dynamics of overland-flow processes play a significant role
   in the persistence of land degradation in the US Southwest. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the activity of peptides in earthworm tissue and
   coelomic fluid, we established the peptide separation and purification
   method in our laboratory. Six antimicrobial peptides were isolated and
   purified from earthworm tissue liquid homogenate and coelomic fluid,
   which contained 5-50 amino acid (AA) residues with the same or similar
   sequence of Ala-Met-Val-Ser-Gly, and named the antibacterial
   vermipeptides family (AVPF) according to their structure and
   antibacterial characteristics. In this paper, we introduced a general
   protocol of AVPF peptide preparation methods from earthworms, including
   crude peptide preparation and purification by ultrafiltration,
   ion-exchange chromatography, gel-filtration and HPLC chromatography. The
   AVPF includes a wide antibacterial spectrum and speciality, performs
   antimicrobial activities not only to Gram-positive and Gram-negative
   bacteria but also to fungi. Multi-functions of some peptides of AVPF
   have been reported. As an example, the resistance of EP3 and EP5 of AVPF
   to cancer cells, HeLa and MGC803 has been reported. EP5 caused apoptosis
   of HeLa cell. The threshold value of EP3 that causes apoptosis of HeLa
   cells was 0.75 mg/mL with an apoptotic rate of 48.12\%. MGC803 cells
   showed significant morphological changes when the cells were attached by
   EP3. Short peptides with 5-7 amino acid residues formed multimers in the
   PB buffer, a more likely explanation for the antibacterial mechanism of
   short peptides that causes MGC803 cells to break. The antiviral effect
   of antimicrobial peptides (EP5) on the pseudorabies virus (PRV) was
   analyzed using the cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition test. Results
   showed that EP5 inhibited the CPE by PRV on BHK cells. The mechanism of
   antiviral activity of EP5 may be explained by inhibiting the duplication
   of viral DNA. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Many species are currently expanding their ranges in response to
   climate change, but the mechanisms underlying these range expansions are
   in many cases poorly understood. In this paper we explore potential
   climatic factors governing the recent establishment of new palm
   populations far to the north of any other viable palm population in the
   world.
   Location Southern Switzerland, Europe, Asia and the world.
   Methods We identified ecological threshold values for the target
   species, Trachycarpus fortunei, based on gridded climate data, altitude
   and distributional records from the native range and applied them to the
   introduced range using local field monitoring and measured
   meteorological data as well as a bioclimatic model.
   Results We identified a strong relationship between minimum winter
   temperatures, influenced by growing season length and the distribution
   of the palm in its native range. Recent climate change strongly
   coincides with the palm's recent spread into southern Switzerland, which
   is in concert with the expansion of the global range of palms across
   various continents.
   Main conclusions Our results strongly suggest that the expansion of
   palms into (semi-)natural forests is driven by changes in winter
   temperature and growing season length and not by delayed population
   expansion. This implies that this rapid expansion is likely to continue
   in the future under a warming climate. Palms in general, and T. fortunei
   in particular, are significant bioindicators across continents for
   present-day climate change and reflect a global signal towards warmer
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A normative analysis of the problem of optimal extraction of a

   pattern of the resource extraction. Different approaches are offered for
   the construction of the paths of switching to decreasing resource use.
   Some seemingly attractive short-run policies of switching to decreasing
   extraction can run counter to long-run criteria. If we consider the
   maximin principle, applied to the negative shock on the output percent
   change, as the short-run criterion, then the optimal transition path can
   be consistent with the long-run government goals. It is shown
   analytically and numerically that there are values of parameters for the
   transition paths of extraction that consumption along these paths is
   asymptotically constant or infinitely growing. A new approach to the
   Rawlsian maximin criterion which allows for growth of consumption is

Abstract = {{Much contemporary ecology emphasises the importance of taking a spatial
   perspective in linking ecological patterns and processes. However,
   collecting and analysing spatial data is expensive. Here we compare
   spatially implicit and spatially explicit versions of a model of
   successional dynamics in a forest- shrubland mosaic in a mountain-top
   reserve in New Caledonia. The models are used to (i) understand the
   circumstances driving change in abundance of forest and shrubland, and
   (ii) compare the outcomes of spatially explicit and spatially implicit
   models of the same system. The spatially explicit model is grid-based
   and uses a spatially implemented `state-and-transition' approach, with
   fire spread and seed dispersal the main spatial processes considered.
   The spatially implicit model is based on a transition matrix approach.
   TWO alternative transition matrices were constructed, one based on field
   measurements and the other parameterised using output from the spatially
   explicit model. Although the averaged dynamics of the two models appear
   similar, the models make very different qualitative predictions about
   the landscape. Under the same initial parameter conditions two
   alternative landscape states emerge from the spatially explicit model;
   this is not the case for the spatially implicit model. Further, the
   spatial model produces outcomes much closer to those documented
   historically and inferred from the palxoecological record. The
   differences between the non-spatial and spatial models arise because, in
   this system, fine-scale interactions between landscape pattern and
   process are drivers of coarser scale dynamics, and such interactions are
   not included in the spatially implicit model. More generally, in order
   to understand coarse-scale spatial dynamics it may be important to
   consider local spatial patterns; spatially explicit models are those
   most likely to incorporate these. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {{The World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List Index (RLI) is used to
   measure global trends in the status of biodiversity. We examined bow the
   index might be used to measure the trend in the status of indigenous
   breeding birds in British Columbia between 1992 and 2006 We followed the
   RLI method described by Butchart et al. (2004, 2007) as closely as
   possible. Because IUCV Red List assessments at the regional level are
   not available in British Columbia, we used NatureServe S (subnational)
   ranking data. We calculated three index trend lines. The first two of
   these allowed us to compare an index based on our original data to one
   based on data that had been retrospectively corrected, the latter
   produced a smooth, flat line. A third trend line, based on the corrected
   data but excluding species new to province since 194 7, produced a
   gently sloping downward trend. Ongoing immigration of bird species in
   and out of British Columbia added to the complexity of interpreting our
   regional RLI-type index, especially because our S-rank data did not
   incorporate transboundary ``rescue{''} effects. Because the RLI is
   scaled so that the maximum value is based on a state in which all
   species are simultaneously ranked as least concern, it may exaggerate
   the highest potential status of intrinsically vulnerable species. A
   simpler, more intuitive graphic allows reporting that is less dependent
   on context. We believe the RLI approach holds useful innovation for an
   indicator of change in biodiversity within jurisdictional boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive mammals are the greatest threat to island biodiversity and
   invasive rodents are likely responsible for the greatest number of
   extinctions and ecosystem changes. Techniques for eradicating rodents
   from islands were developed over 2 decades ago. Since that time there
   has been a significant development and application of this conservation
   tool. We reviewed the literature on invasive rodent eradications to
   assess its current state and identify actions to make it more effective.
   Worldwide, 332 successful rodent eradications have been undertaken; we
   identified 35 failed eradications and 20 campaigns of unknown result.
   Invasive rodents have been eradicated from 284 islands (47,628 ha). With
   the exception of two small islands, rodenticides were used in all
   eradication campaigns. Brodifacoum was used in 71\% of campaigns and
   91\% of the total area treated. The most frequent rodenticide
   distribution methods (from most to least) are bait stations, hand
   broadcasting, and aerial broadcasting. Nevertheless, campaigns using
   aerial broadcast made up 76\% of the total area treated. Mortality of
   native vertebrates due to nontarget poisoning has been documented, but
   affected species quickly recover to pre-eradication population levels or
   higher A variety of methods have been developed to mitigate nontarget
   impacts, and applied research can further aid in minimizing impacts.
   Land managers should routinely remove invasive rodents from islands <
   100 ha that lack vertebrates susceptible to nontarget poisoning. For
   larger islands and those that require nontarget mitigation, expert
   consultation and greater planning effort are needed. With the exception
   of house mice (Mus musculus), island size may no longer be the limiting
   factor for rodent eradications; rather, social acceptance and funding
   may be the main challenges. TO be successful, large-scale rodent
   campaigns should be integrated with programs to improve the livelihoods
   of residents, island biosecurity, and reinvasion response programs.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic conservation plans have only recently considered the dynamic
   nature of ecosystems. Methods have been developed to incorporate climate
   change, population dynamics, and uncertainty in reserve design, but few
   studies have examined how to account for natural disturbance.
   Considering natural disturbance in reserve design may be especially
   important for the world's remaining intact areas, which still experience
   active natural disturbance regimes. We developed a spatially explicit,
   dynamic simulation model, CONSERV, which simulates patch dynamics and
   fire, and used it to evaluate the efficacy of hypothetical reserve
   networks in northern Canada. We designed six networks based on
   conventional reserve design methods, with different conservation targets
   for woodland caribou habitat, high-quality wetlands, vegetation, water
   bodies, and relative connectedness. We input the six reserve networks
   into CONSERV and tracked the ability of each to maintain initial
   conservation targets through time under an active natural disturbance
   regime. None of the reserve networks maintained all initial targets, and
   some over-represented certain features, suggesting that both
   effectiveness and efficiency of reserve design could be improved through
   use of spatially explicit dynamic simulation during the planning
   process. Spatial simulation models of landscape dynamics are commonly
   used in natural resource management, but we provide the first
   illustration of their potential use for reserve design. Spatial
   simulation models could be used iteratively to evaluate competing
   reserve designs and select targets that have a higher likelihood of
   being maintained through time. Such models could be combined with
   dynamic planning techniques to develop a general theory for reserve
   design in an uncertain world.}},

Abstract = {{1. Stream habitat quality assessment complements biological assessment
   by providing a mechanism for ruling out habitat degradation as a
   potential stressor and provides reference targets for the physical
   aspects of stream restoration projects. This study analysed five
   approaches for predicting habitat conditions based on discriminant
   function, linear regressions, ordination and nearest neighbour analyses.
   2. Quantitative physical and chemical habitat and riparian conditions in
   minimally-impacted streams in New Hampshire were estimated using United
   States Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and
   Assessment Program protocols. Catchment-scale descriptors were used to
   predict segment-scale stream channel and riparian habitat, and the
   accuracy and precision of the different modelling approaches were
   compared.
   3. A new assessment index comparing and summarizing the degree of
   correspondence between predicted and observed habitat based on Euclidean
   distance between the standardized habitat factors is described. Higher
   index scores (i.e. greater Euclidean distance) would suggest a greater
   deviation in habitat between observed conditions and expected reference
   conditions. As in most biotic indices, the range in index scores in
   reference sites would constitute a situation equivalent to reference
   conditions. This new index avoids the erroneous prediction of multiple,
   mutually exclusive habitat conditions that have confounded previous
   habitat assessment approaches.
   4. Separate linear regression models for each habitat descriptor yielded
   the most accurate and precise prediction of reference conditions, with a
   coefficient of variation (CV) between predictions and observations for
   all reference sites of 0.269. However, for a unified implementation in
   regions where a classification-based approach has already been taken for
   biological assessment, a discriminant analysis approach, that predicted
   membership in biotic communities and compared the mean habitat features
   in the biotic communities with the observed habitat features, was
   similar in prediction accuracy and precision (CV = 0.293).
   5. The best model had an error of 27\% of the mean index value for the
   reference sites, indicating substantial room for improvement. Additional
   catchment characteristics not readily available for this analysis, such
   as average rainfall or winter snow-pack, surficial geological
   characteristics or past land-use history, may improve the precision of
   the predicted habitat features in the reference streams. Land-use
   history in New Hampshire and regional environmental impacts have greatly
   impacted stream habitat conditions even in streams considered
   minimally-impacted today; thus as regional environmental impacts change
   and riparian forests mature, reference habitat conditions should be
   re-evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores and contrasts the different social processes of
   valuation now appearing as economic means of valuing the environment.
   Monetary valuation via stated preference approaches has been criticised
   for assuming well formed and informed preferences and excluding a range
   of sustainability concerns such as rights, fairness and equity.
   Deliberative monetary valuation (DMV) in small groups is a novel hybrid
   of economic and political approaches which raises the prospect of a
   transformative and moralising experience. Critics of standard contingent
   valuation approaches have advocated this as offering a way forward.
   However there has been a lack of clarity as to the means of obtaining
   values, the expected outcomes and their role. Moving to group settings
   of deliberation raises concepts of social willingness to pay and accept
   which are distinct from an aggregate of individual value, although this
   does not seem to have been widely recognised. A new classification of
   values is presented appropriate to the literature trying to merge
   economic and political processes. Values associated with the individual
   may be exchange values, charitable contributions or fair prices, while
   social values can be speculative, expressive or arbitrated. The use of
   DMV is shown to result in different values due to variations in the
   institutional setting and process of valuation.}},

Abstract = {{New statistical modelling methods, such as neural networks (NNs), allow
   us to take a step further in the understanding of complex relations in
   aquatic ecosystems. In this paper the results from the analysis of
   macro-invertebrate communities in a complex riverine environment are
   presented. We attempted to explain observed changes in species
   composition and abundance with neural network modelling methods and
   compared the results to linear regression. The NN method used is an
   improved form of the RF5 algorithm, developed to effectively discover
   numeric laws from data. RF5 uses Product Unit Networks (PUNs), which are
   in effect multivariate non-discrete power functions. The data set
   consisted of a 10-year time series of monthly samples of
   macro-invertebrates on artificial substrates in the rivers Rhine and
   Meuse in the Netherlands. During this period the invertebrate community
   has largely changed coinciding with the invasion of Ponto-Caspian
   crustaceans. We used physical-chemical data and data on the abundance of
   the invasive taxa Corophium curvispinum and Dikerogammarus villosis to
   explain the observed changes in the resident invertebrate community. The
   analyses showed temperature, abundance of invasive taxa and peak
   discharges as important factors. Comparison of the results from NN
   modelling to linear regression revealed that the factors temperature and
   abundance of Dikerogammarus villosis explained equally well in both
   cases. Only the neural network was able to use information on peak
   discharge and timing of the peak in the previous winter to improve model
   performances. Neural networks are known to yield excellent modelling
   results, a drawback however is their lack of transparency or their
   `black box' character. The use of relatively easy interpretable (white
   box) PUNs allows us to investigate the extracted relations in more
   detail and can enhance our understanding of ecosystem functioning. Our
   results show that peak discharges might be an important factor
   structuring invertebrate communities in rivers and hint on the existence
   of interacting effects from invasive species and discharge peaks. They
   finally show the value of biological data sets that are collected over a
   long period and in a highly standardised way.}},

Abstract = {{To enhance our understanding of how aquatic endotherms respond thermally
   to their environment, we present two new designs for recording heat flux
   (HF) and skin temperature (T-s) from the dorsal fins of free-ranging
   dolphins. The first package, held on by a series of small suction cups,
   was designed for short-tenn deployments on the order of hours. The
   second package, a long-term attachment, was held on via two 5.0-min
   -Delrin (R) pins and was designed for deployments on the order of days.
   The former version was configured to release remotely, by way of a
   galvanic linkage, removing the need to re-capture tagged dolphins. The
   latter was designed to be removed after re-capture of the individual but
   also included a fail-safe galvanic release. One of the major advances of
   our approach is that it allows both convective and conductive pathways
   of heat loss to be dynamically recorded from freeswimming wild dolphins,
   whereas previous approaches have recorded primarily conductive heat loss
   from trained captive or restrained wild dolphins. The short-tenn,
   re-usable package has been field-tested on 55 bottlenose dolphins
   (Tursiops truncatus) in Sarasota Bay, Florida and the long-term device
   on two spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) in the eastern tropical
   Pacific Ocean. By also incorporating into each package a
   time-depth-velocity recorder we were able to examine patterns of heat
   flux in relation to changing behavioural states of the tagged
   individual. Heat flux recorded at the dorsal fin was found to be
   individually variable and dynamic. Water temperature (T-w) had a
   profound effect on patterns of heat loss in both species with HF
   increasing with even minor decreases in T-w. This device significantly
   improves our ability to understand the thermal biology of dolphins as
   they move about in their natural environment. (c) 2007 Published by

Abstract = {{Questions: How is restored inundation affecting the groundwater
   composition in a floodplain? To what extent has the floodplain plant
   community composition changed ? What are the effects of flooding
   frequency and intensity and water quality on the floodplain vegetation
   changes?
   Location: Demer river, Flanders, Belgium.
   Methods: 75 10 m x 10 m plots were surveyed in 1997 and in 2003.
   Vegetation changes were quantified using a Detrended Correspondence
   Analysis on the combined 1997-2003 dataset. Groundwater quality in the
   floodplain was analysed on inacro-ions. Inundation intensity and
   frequency were related to vegetation changes.
   Results: The inundation water was rich in nutrients, although only for
   NH4 and ortho-PO4, and a significant increase was recorded in the
   groundwater. Plant species characteristic of very nutrient-rich herb
   vegetation disappeared or decreased while the cover and species richness
   of species from wet, moderately productive habitats increased. Very few
   new species colonized the floodplain.
   Conclusion: Nutrient-rich flooding water does not necessarily result in
   increased abundance of species from nutrient-rich habitats, very likely
   because N becomes less available by denitrification and is transformed
   into biomass by tall herbs. Either micro-site limitation or dispersal
   limitation could explain the colonization problems of new species. The
   data do not allow distinction between these two mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Threatened and endangered species recovery programs consume increasing
   resources. Even so, there is increased concern about actual and
   projected biodiversity losses and in the success of recovery programs in
   reversing these trends. In this paper, we use a panel data set and
   ordered probit econometric methods to statistically examine the
   determinants of the 1990-2002 biennial U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
   (FWS) recovery scores for up to 225 vertebrate species listed as
   threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. We find that
   species-specific spending is a significant determinant of species'
   recovery scores and that increased spending reduces the probability that
   FWS will classify a species as extinct or declining. The evidence does
   not support the hypothesis that increased spending increases the
   probability that a species is stable or improving. Other FWS' actions
   have significant and substantive influences on improved recovery scores.
   These include progress on or completion of a recovery plan and
   achievement of stated recovery objectives. We find evidence that species
   achieve better recovery scores if FWS considers them to have high
   recovery potential and that species whose recovery is judged by FWS to
   be in conflict with economic activity are more likely to be classified
   as extinct. Our evidence does not support the conclusion that critical
   habitat designation promotes species' recoveries or prevents species'
   declines. We also report a new finding that recovery success varies
   across FWS administrative regions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Aim To provide a quantitative spatial analysis of the riverscape
   (open-water bodies and their surrounding areas) of the Western Amazonian
   lowlands using a consistent surface of remotely sensed imagery. Taking
   into account the essential significance of fluvial environments for the
   Amazonian biota, we propose that an enhanced understanding of the
   Amazonian riverscape will provide new insight for biogeographical
   studies in the region and contribute to the understanding of these
   megadiverse tropical lowlands.
   Location An area of 2.2 million km(2) covering the Western Amazonian
   lowlands of the Andean foreland region, i.e. the upper reaches of the
   Amazon river system. Areas in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil
   and Bolivia between longitudes 83 degrees W and 65 degrees W and
   latitudes 5 degrees N and 12 degrees S are included.
   Methods A mosaic of 120 Landsat TM satellite images was created with
   100-m resolution, and water areas of over I ha in size or c. 60 m in
   width were extracted using a simple ratio threshold applicable to a
   large set of data. With this method, 99.1\% of the water areas present
   in 30-m imagery were mapped with images with 100-m resolution. Water
   pixels of distinct river segments were assigned to river classes on the
   basis of their channel properties, and islands and lakes were
   distinguished separately and classified. Measures of water patterns such
   as structure, composition, richness and remoteness were provided for
   various spatial units. Riverine corridors were computed from the
   open-water mask by outer limits of active channels and floodplain lakes.
   Analytical results are shown as both thematic maps and statistics.
   Results A total of 1.1\% of Western Amazonia is covered by open-water
   bodies over 1 ha in size or 60 m in width. River-bound waters comprise
   98\% of the total water surface. Whilst isolated lakes are scarce,
   river-bound oxbow and backchannel lakes are plentiful, comprising 17.5\%
   of all waters. They are particularly frequent along meandering channels,
   which dominate both in area and length. The riverine corridors including
   active channels and floodplain lakes cover 17\% of the land area. The
   average distance from any point of land to the nearest water is 12 km.
   Geographically speaking, the distribution of waters is uneven across the
   region, and the detailed characteristics of the riverscape are
   geographically highly variable. Three major, fluvially distinct regions
   can be identified: central Western Amazonia, the south, and the
   nortb-east. The proportional surface areas of the riverine corridors,
   numbers of lakes, sizes of islands and their distributions depend
   largely on the types and sizes of the rivers.
   Main conclusions Our results support the notion of Western Amazonia as a
   dynamic, highly fluvial environment, highlighting and quantifying
   considerable internal variation within the region in terms of fluvial
   patterns and the processes that they reflect and control.
   Biogeographically, the variety of types of fluvial environments and
   their characteristics are important constituents of what influences the
   distribution of species and dynamics of terrestrial habitats. Spatially
   consistent riverscape data can serve as a consistent and scalable source
   of relevant information for other biogeographical approaches in the
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Did the forest area in the Swiss Alps increase between 1985
   and 1997? Does the forest expansion near the tree line represent an
   invasion into abandoned grasslands (ingrowth) or a true upward shift of
   the local tree line? What land cover / land use classes did primarily
   regenerate to forest, and what forest structural types did primarily
   regenerate? And, what are possible drivers of forest regeneration in the
   tree line ecotone, climate and/or land use change?
   Location: Swiss Alps.
   Methods: Forest expansion was quantified using data from the repeated
   Swiss land use statistics GEOSTAT. A moving window algorithm was
   developed to distinguish between forest ingrowth and upward shift. To
   test a possible climate change influence, the resulting upward shifts
   were compared to a potential regional tree line.
   Results: A significant increase of forest cover was found between 1650
   to and 2450 m. Above 1650 m, 10\% of the new forest areas were
   identified as true upward shifts whereas 90\% represented ingrowth, and
   we identified both land use and climate change as likely drivers. Most
   upward shift activities were found to occur within a band of 300 m below
   the potential regional tree line, indicating land use as the most likely
   driver. Only 4\% of the upward shifts were identified to rise above the
   potential regional tree line, thus indicating climate change.
   Conclusions: Land abandonment was the most dominant driver for the
   establishment of new forest areas, even at the tree line ecotone.
   However, a small fraction of upwards shift can be attributed to the
   recent climate warming, a fraction that is likely to increase further if
   climate continues to warm, and with a longer time-span between warming
   and measurement of forest cover.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved O-2 is an important aquatic ecosystem health indicator.
   Metabolic and gas exchange (G) rates, which control O-2 concentration,
   are affected by nutrient loading and other environmental factors.
   Traditionally, aquatic metabolism has been reported as primary
   production:community respiration (P:R) ratios using diel measurements
   and interpretations of dissolved O-2 and/or CO2 concentrations, and
   recently using stable isotopes (delta O-18, Delta P-17) and steady state
   assumptions. Aquatic ecosystems, such as rivers and ponds, are not at
   steady state and exhibit diel changes, so steady state approaches are
   often inappropriate. A dynamic O-2 stable isotope model
   (photosynthesis-respiration-gas exchange; PoRGy) is presented here,
   requiring a minimum of parameters to quantify daily averaged P, R, and G
   rates under transient field conditions. Unlike steady state approaches,
   PoRGy can address scenarios with 100\% O-2 saturation but with delta
   O-18-O-2 values that are not at air equilibrium. PoRGy successfully
   accounts for isotopic G when applied to an oxygen isotope equilibration
   laboratory experiment. PoRGy model results closely matched the diel O-2
   and delta O-18-O-2 data from three field sites with different P:R:G
   ratios and various P, R and G rates. PoRGy provides a new research tool
   to assess ecosystem health and to pose environmental impact-driven
   questions. Using daily averaged rates was successful and thus they can
   be used to compare ecosystems across seasons and landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the possible role of variation in predation pressure in
   the phenotypic divergence of two island populations of the Italian wall
   lizard, Podarcis sicula. In 1971, ten adult specimens from the island of
   Pod Kopiste (Adriatic Sea, Croatia) were transported to the island of
   Pod Mrcaru, 3.5 km east, where they founded a new population. Although
   the two islands resemble each other in general physiognomy (size,
   elevation, microclimate) and in the absence of terrestrial predators,
   lizards from the newly established population are now on average larger
   and have shorter hind limbs. They also exhibit lower maximal sprint
   speed as measured on a racetrack, and fatigue faster when chased in a
   torus track. In the field, lizards from the original population of Pod
   Kopiste respond to a simulated predatory attack by fleeing at larger
   approach distances and by running further from the predator than lizards
   from Pod Mrcaru. These changes in morphology, behaviour and performance
   may result from the relaxed predation intensity on the latter island.
   Our analysis of the structural features of the microhabitats suggests
   that the vegetation on Pod Mrcaru offers more protection to lizards.
   Also, plasticine models of lizards, laid out on the islands, less often
   exhibited signs of being attacked by birds on Pod Mrcaru than on Pod
   Kopiste. Our findings provide an example of how changes in (possibly a
   single) environmental factor may simultaneously produce responses in
   behaviour, morphology and whole-animal physiology, and this on a
   surprisingly small spatial and temporal scale.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid degradation of many reefs worldwide calls for more effective
   monitoring and predictions of the trajectories of coral reef habitats as
   they cross cycles of disturbance and recovery. Current approaches
   include in situ monitoring, computer modelling, and remote sensing
   observations. We aimed to combine these three sources of information for
   Abore Reef in New Caledonia by using: (1) a generic timed automata model
   of reef habitat trajectories, (2) two high spatial resolution
   multispectral images acquired before and after hurricane Erika in a
   2-year interval (March, 2003), and (3) extensive field data on Abore's
   benthic community structure. Field and remote sensing observations were
   used to verify model predictions of habitat evolution during the 2-year
   interval. We also tested whether a fairly generic model of habitat
   evolution can be used to flag local incorrect image change detection
   interpretation. The automaton manipulates objects such as states,
   transitions and clocks (transition times), and we found that it is
   possible, with expert knowledge, to describe complex habitat
   trajectories with this formalism. On Abore Reef, we analyzed 22
   heterogeneous polygons mapped before and after hurricane Erika using a
   36 habitat typology. We examined 75 trajectories suggested by the
   before-after image classifications and critically reviewed the benefits
   of the combined timed automata model-image approach. The Abore Reef case
   study confirms that this is a fruitful path to maximize the benefits of
   both tools, and minimize their respective drawbacks. However, we
   conclude that timed automata and remote sensing analysis need to be
   locally optimized to achieve useful results, and suggests further
   improvements by using hybrid models able to manipulate continuous, and
   fuzzy, properties. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Critical to the conservation of biodiversity is knowledge of status and
   trends of species. To that end, monitoring programmes have reported on
   the state of biodiversity using reference conditions as comparison.
   Little consensus exists on how reference conditions are defined and how
   such information is used to index intactness. Most use protected areas
   or an arbitrary year as reference. This is problematic since protected
   areas are often spatially biased, while arbitrarily defined reference
   years are often not sufficiently distant in time. We propose an
   alternative that relies on empirical estimates of reference conditions.
   Statistical ranges of reference are estimated and compared with observed
   occurrence and abundance to index status of individual species. When
   averaged among species, overall iritactness is estimated. We demonstrate
   the approach using 202-winter mammal tracking sites from the boreal
   forest of Alberta, Canada. Intactness was estimated at 89 out of 100
   with the southern boreal having lowest intactness and greatest human
   footprint. We suggest empirical predictions of reference conditions be
   used as baselines for comparing changes in the state of species and
   biodiversity. Reporting can occur at any spatial (e.g., ecosystem) or
   hierarchical (e.g., species, guilds, taxonomic group, or overall
   biodiversity) scale and is easily interpreted (scaled from 0-degraded to
   100-intact). When used in a long-term monitoring framework, statistical
   trends in biodiversity intactness can be estimated, individual status of
   species assessed, and relevant policy evaluated. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Woodpeckers are considered keystone species for webs of cavity nesters
   and habitat and resource specialists that strongly depend on
   availability of trees suitable for cavity excavation. Most studies
   carried out in northern hemisphere temperate coniferous forests
   emphasize the importance of old growth stages of forests or large dead
   trees as habitat for cavity builders. We present a study of Nothofagus
   pumilio tree selection by the magellanic woodpecker (Campephilus
   magellanicus) that incorporates dendroecological data on long-term
   growth trends of trees that provides new insights into the processes
   that create suitable habitat for cavity excavating species. We analysed
   351 cavity and neighbouring control trees in terms of age and radial
   growth patterns, as well as external tree characteristics. In addition,
   from a subsample of these trees we developed tree-ring chronologies for
   each group using standard methods in order to analyse potential
   differences in radial growth patterns between cavity and non-cavity
   trees. Multivariate models that account for differences between paired
   cavities versus control trees indicated that growth decline and the
   degree of crown dieback were the primary variables explaining magellanic
   woodpecker tree selection for cavity building. In contrast to previous
   work, neither diameter (above a certain threshold) nor age, were
   important determinants of selection. Furthermore, trees that became
   present cavity are those that had synchronously declined in radial
   growth during the 1943-44 and 1956-57 droughts and the 1985-86 massive
   caterpillar defoliation. Insect outbreaks and extreme climatic events
   may episodically reduce vigour, induce partial crown mortality, trigger
   increased fungal attack and heart rot formation at different tree
   heights on the bole in a group of trees and thus increase availability
   of soft substrate and their likelihood of cavity excavation by the
   magellanic woodpecker. These results underscore the importance of
   drought/biotically-induced canopy dieback events in creating habitat for

Abstract = {{Statistically distinguishing density-dependent from density-independent
   populations and selecting the best demographic model for a given
   population are problems of primary importance. Traditional approaches
   are PBLR (parametric bootstrapping of likelihood ratios) and Information
   criteria (IC), such as the Schwarz information criterion (SIC), the
   Akaike information criterion (AIC) or the Final prediction error (FPE).
   While PBLR is suitable for choosing from a couple of models, ICs select
   the best model from among a set of candidates. In this paper, we use the
   Structural risk minimization (SRM) approach. SRM is the model selection
   criterion developed within the Statistical learning theory (SLT), a
   theory of great generality for modelling and learning with finite
   samples. SRM is almost unknown in the ecological literature and has
   never been used to analyze time series.
   First, we compare SRM with PBLR in terms of their ability to
   discriminate between the Malthusian and the density-dependent Ricker
   model. We rigorously repeat the experiments described in a previous
   study and find out that SRM is equally powerful in detecting
   density-independence and much more powerful in detecting
   density-dependence.
   Then, we compare SRM against ICs in terms of their ability to select one
   of several candidate models; we generate, via stochastic simulation, a
   huge amount of artificial time series both density-independent and
   dependent, with and without exogenous covariates, using different
   dataset sizes, noise levels and parameter values. Our findings show that
   SRM outperforms traditional ICs, because generally a) it recognizes the
   model underlying the data with higher frequency, and b) it leads to
   lower errors in out-of-samples predictions. SRM superiority is specially
   apparent with short time series.
   We finally apply SRM to the population records of Alpine ibex Capra ibex
   living in the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy), already investigated
   by other authors via traditional statistical methods; we both analyze
   their models and introduce some novel ones. We show that models that are
   best according to SRM show also the lowest leave-one-out
   cross-validation error.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological patterns are difficult to extract directly from vegetation
   data. The respective surveys provide a high number of interrelated
   species occurrence variables. Since often only a limited number of
   ecological gradients determine species distributions, the data might be
   represented by much fewer but effectively independent variables. This
   can be achieved by reducing the dimensionality of the data. Conventional
   methods are either limited to linear feature extraction (e.g., principal
   component analysis, and Classical Multidimensional Scaling, CMDS) or
   require a priori assumptions on the intrinsic data dimensionality (e.g.,
   Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling, NMDS, and self organized maps, SOM).
   In this study we explored the potential of Isometric Feature Mapping
   (Isomap). This new method of dimensionality reduction is a nonlinear
   generalization of CMDS. Isomap is based on a nonlinear geodesic
   inter-point distance matrix. Estimating geodesic distances requires one
   free threshold parameter, which defines linear geometry to be preserved
   in the global nonlinear distance structure. We compared Isomap to its
   linear (CMDS) and nonmetric NMDS) equivalents. Furthermore, the use of
   geodesic distances allowed also extending NMDS to a version that we
   called NMDS-G. In addition we investigated a supervised Isomap valiant
   (S-Isomap) and showed that all these techniques are interpretable within
   a single methodical framework.
   As an example we investigated seven plots (subdivided in 456 subplots)
   in different secondary tropical montane forests with 773 species of
   vascular plants. A key problem for the study of tropical vegetation data
   is the heterogeneous small scale variability implying large ranges of
   beta-diversity. The CMDS and NMDS methods did not reduce the data
   dimensionality reasonably. On the contrary, Isomap, explained 95\% of
   the data variance in the first five dimensions and provided ecologically
   interpretable visualizations; NMDS-G yielded similar results. The main
   shortcoming of the latter was the high computational cost and the
   requirement to predefine the dimension of the embedding space. The
   S-Isomap learning scheme did not improve the Isomap variant for an
   optimal threshold parameter but substantially improved the nonoptimal
   solutions.
   We conclude that Isomap as a new ordination method allows effective
   representations of high dimensional vegetation data sets. The method is
   promising since it does not require a priori assumptions, and is
   computationally highly effective.}},

Abstract = {{Minimum patch size for a viable population can be estimated in several
   ways. The density-area method estimates minimum patch size as the
   smallest area in which no new individuals are encountered as one extends
   the arbitrary boundaries of a study area outward. The density-area
   method eliminates the assumption of no variation in density with size of
   habitat area that accompanies other methods, but it is untested in
   situations in which habitat loss has confined populations to small
   areas. We used a variant of the density-area method to study the minimum
   patch size for the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) in Florida,
   USA, where this keystone species is being confined to ever smaller
   habitat fragments. The variant was based on the premise that individuals
   within populations are likely to occur at unusually high densities when
   confined to small areas, and it estimated minimum patch size as the
   smallest area beyond which density plateaus. The data for our study came
   from detailed surveys of 38 populations of the tortoise. For all 38
   populations, the areas occupied were determined empirically, and for 19
   of them, duplicate surveys were undertaken about a decade apart. We
   found that a consistent inverse density-area relationship was present
   over smaller areas. The minimum patch size estimated from the
   density-area relationship was at least 100 ha, which is substantially
   larger than previous estimates. The relative abundance of juveniles was
   inversely related to population density for sites with relatively poor
   habitat quality, indicating that the estimated minimum patch size could
   represent an extinction threshold. We concluded that a negative
   density-area relationship may be an inevitable consequence of excessive
   habitat loss. We also concluded that any detrimental effects of an
   inverse density area relationship may be exacerbated by the
   deterioration in habitat quality that often accompanies habitat loss.
   Finally, we concluded that the value of any estimate of minimum patch
   size as a conservation tool is compromised by excessive habitat loss.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Chronic stress events are defined as disturbance events that
   exceed the lifespan of the dominant plant species, fluctuate in
   intensity and lack abruptness or physical destruction of biomass. Can
   the effects of chronic stress events be measured on vegetation
   communities? Did two chronic stress events, the removal of a tide gate
   and a four year drought, cause a temporary or permanent shift in the
   vegetation communities of a tidal marsh?
   Location: Tidal marsh in southeastern United States.
   Methods: Change in species composition and dominance and community
   change on a landscape level salinity gradient were measured between time
   periods ranging from four months to seven years to construct a
   statistical baseline reference community at freshwater, oligohaline, and
   mesohaline sections of a tidal marsh. Statistical shifts in the plant
   community were defined as changes in the plant community that fell
   outside of the defined baseline reference community.
   Results: Plant community changes outside of the reference community
   occurred in 13 Out of 378 community comparisons. Removal of the tide
   gate had a greater effect on interstitial salinity levels than the
   drought and was most intense in the oligohaline marsh, where between 20
   to 45\% of the freshwater/oligohaline community types permanently
   converted to oligohaline community types. However, community shifts in
   the freshwater and oligohaline marsh induced by the drought were
   temporary, lasting from 1 to 3+ years. Neither chronic stress event
   permanently altered the mesohaline plant communities.
   Conclusion: The effects of chronic stress events could be detected; an
   extended historical record of vegetation change (18 years) was necessary
   to identify community shifts outside of a reference condition of the
   community and to determine if those shifts were permanent or temporary.}},

Abstract = {{Net primary production (NPP) depends crucially on the sun radiation
   absorption, and hence its prediction on the modelling of the radiation.
   In heterogeneous systems such as savannas, the photosynthetically active
   radiation (PAR) absorption is more difficult to predict than in
   homogeneous systems, due to the presence of tree clumps and open grass
   areas. Using a detailed 3D model, we propose new formulations of PAR
   absorption derived from the Beer-Lambert law for heterogeneous
   vegetation. To account for intra-plot vegetation heterogeneity we assume
   an intra-plot partition of space into two or three zones, based on tree
   location. We develop two models derived model from the Beer-Lambert law:
   (1) a simple partition of space below and outside trees, (2) a partition
   in three zones, including the tree shading area. The only model to
   predict PAR interception for all types of spatial patterns was the most
   complex one (including tree +tree shading zone +open grass areas). In
   this model, extinction coefficients can be derived from vegetation
   structural parameters like tree cover, and tree shading area. Tree
   shading area could be computed from geometric site parameters (latitude,
   longitude, tree height). With increasing satellite resolution it can be
   possible to obtain these structural parameters of vegetation (cover,
   overlap, tree height) needed by this Beer-Lambert derived model. Such an
   absorption model could then be used as a basis for a Monteith-style
   model of vegetation functioning for heterogeneous vegetation. (C) 2006

Abstract = {{Plant ecologists have placed increasing emphasis on a functional
   understanding of vegetation. One way to gain insight into the assemblage
   of vegetation communities is to investigate plant trait responses to
   environmental gradients or experimental treatments. We present
   simulations of responses of suites of traits to treatments differing in
   soil resources and disturbance intensity, in order to construct a
   functional response hierarchy of traits. We focus on the traits specific
   leaf area (SLA), plant height, seed mass and life cycle. Though only
   four traits are varied, these traits are connected to other traits
   either through trade-offs (e.g. SLA with leaf life span and relative
   growth rate, seed mass with seed number) or allometric rules (e.g.
   above-ground biomass scales positively with below-ground biomass). Thus
   a wide range of plant life history is represented in the simulations. We
   simulated the assemblage of plant types composed of these traits at two
   fertility levels and four disturbance treatments, i.e. every 7 years,
   annually, or monthly mown, and annually ploughed. We present the results
   of a simulation using LEGOMODEL, an individual-based, spatially
   explicit, ecological field model and develop a novel method to construct
   a functional response hierarchy of traits. A competitive ranking of
   plant types is constructed and subsequently translated into a functional
   response hierarchy of traits on the basis of the variability of trait
   states within the plant type ranking. The competitive superior trait
   states as well as the functional hierarchy change between different
   treatments. Except for deeply disturbed conditions, perennial plants are
   always superior. Tall canopy height is superior on fertile soil, as long
   as it is not mown monthly. High SLA is advantageous at fertile or
   ploughed sites. Life cycle and canopy height are always at the first two
   ranks of the functional hierarchy of traits. Our results concerning the
   advantageous trait states are in line with published field studies,
   except for the trait seed mass. Here LEGOMODEL predicts competitive
   advantage of small seeds under any treatment. The functional response
   hierarchy of traits presents a hypothesis to be refined by further field
   research as we know of no field study addressing this question. (C) 2006

Abstract = {{This study combines niche modeling and systematic area prioritization
   using distribution data for 131 species of amphibians and reptiles from

   performance of the current conservation area network in Northeast India
   with respect to the representation of amphibians and reptiles, and (ii)
   to identify potential areas for expanding the current conservation area
   network. In a two-step protocol, maximum entropy niche modeling was used
   to project species' potential geographic occurrences, and the resulting
   probabilistic distribution data were used to prioritize areas with
   algorithms that maximize the representation of all species in minimal
   total area. The results provided a critical assessment of conservation
   priorities in this data-deficient region, and indicate the utility of
   combining niche modeling with systematic area prioritization in such
   situations. Many areas that had been overlooked in previous assessments
   were identified. Although the existing protected areas were found to be
   inadequate for representation of amphibian and reptile diversity, the
   prioritization results show that by targeting a minimal representation
   of 5\% of the current total area suitable for each species, the gaps can
   be filled with a relatively modest (0.41\%) increase in the current
   total area covered by the network. Extended analyses were also performed
   to assess the effects of putatively rare species on reserve selection,
   which showed that the inclusion of these taxa can change the
   prioritization solutions significantly. The prioritization results also

Abstract = {{Aim To test the hypothesis that anthropogenic alteration of stream-flow
   regimes is a key driver of compositional shifts from native to
   introduced riparian plant species.
   Location The arid south-western United States; 24 river reaches in the
   Gila and Lower Colorado drainage basins of Arizona.
   Methods We compared the abundance of three dominant woody riparian taxa
   (native Populus fremontii and Salix gooddingii, and introduced Tamarix)
   between river reaches that varied in stream-flow permanence (perennial
   vs. intermittent), presence or absence of an upstream flow-regulating
   dam, and presence or absence of municipal effluent as a stream water
   source.
   Results Populus and Salix were the dominant pioneer trees along the
   reaches with perennial flow and a natural flood regime. In contrast,
   Tamarix had high abundance (patch area and basal area) along reaches
   with intermittent stream flows (caused by natural and cultural factors),
   as well as those with dam-regulated flows.
   Main conclusions Stream-flow regimes are strong determinants of riparian
   vegetation structure, and hydrological alterations can drive dominance
   shifts to introduced species that have an adaptive suite of traits. Deep
   alluvial groundwater on intermittent rivers favours the deep-rooted,
   stress-adapted Tamarix over the shallower-rooted and more competitive
   Populus and Salix. On flow-regulated rivers, shifts in flood timing
   favour the reproductively opportunistic Tamarix over Populus and Salix,
   both of which have narrow germination windows. The prevailing
   hydrological conditions thus favour a new dominant pioneer species in
   the riparian corridors of the American Southwest. These results reaffirm
   the importance of reinstating stream-flow regimes (inclusive of
   groundwater flows) for re-establishing the native pioneer trees as the
   dominant forest type.}},

Abstract = {{Aim We analysed lake-sediment pollen records from eight sites in
   southern New England to address: (1) regional variation in ecological
   responses to post-glacial climatic changes, (2) landscape-scale
   vegetational heterogeneity at different times in the past, and (3)
   environmental and ecological controls on spatial patterns of vegetation.
   Location The eight study sites are located in southern New England in
   the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut. The sites span a climatic
   and vegetational gradient from the lowland areas of eastern
   Massachusetts and Connecticut to the uplands of north-central and
   western Massachusetts. Tsuga canadensis and Fagus grandifolia are
   abundant in the upland area, while Quercus, Carya and Pinus species have
   higher abundances in the lowlands.
   Methods We collected sediment cores from three lakes in eastern and
   north-central Massachusetts (Berry East, Blood and Little Royalston
   Ponds). Pollen records from those sites were compared with previously
   published pollen data from five other sites. Multivariate data analysis
   (non-metric multi-dimensional scaling) was used to compare the pollen
   spectra of these sites through time.
   Results Our analyses revealed a sequence of vegetational responses to
   climate changes occurring across southern New England during the past
   14,000 calibrated radiocarbon years before present (cal yr BP). Pollen
   assemblages at all sites were dominated by Picea and Pinus banksiana
   between 14,000 and 11,500 cal yr BP; by Pinus strobus from 11,500 to
   10,500 cal yr BP; and by P. strobus and Tsuga between 10,500 and 9500
   cal yr BP. At 9500-8000 cal yr BP, however, vegetation composition began
   to differentiate between lowland and upland sites. Lowland sites had
   higher percentages of Quercus pollen, whereas Tsuga abundance was higher
   at the upland sites. This spatial heterogeneity strengthened between
   8000 and 5500 cal yr BP, when Fagus became abundant in the uplands and
   Quercus pollen percentages increased further in the lowland records. The
   differentiation of upland and lowland vegetation zones remained strong
   during the mid-Holocene Tsuga decline (5500-3500 cal yr BP), but the
   pattern weakened during the late-Holocene (3500-300 cal yr BP) and
   European-settlement intervals. Within-group similarity declined in
   response to the uneven late-Holocene expansion of Castanea, while
   between-group similarity increased due to homogenization of the regional
   vegetation by forest clearance and ongoing disturbances.
   Main conclusions The regional gradient of vegetation composition across
   southern New England was first established between 9500 and 8000 cal yr
   BP. The spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation may have arisen at that
   time in response to the development or strengthening of the regional
   climatic gradient. Alternatively, the differentiation of upland and
   lowland vegetation types may have occurred as the climate ameliorated
   and an increasing number of species arrived in the region, arranging
   themselves in progressively more complex vegetation patterns across
   relatively stationary environmental gradients. The emergence of a
   regional vegetational gradient in southern New England may be a
   manifestation of the increasing number of species and more finely
   divided resource gradient.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problematic relationship between publication success and

   P-values are often judged according to whether they lie beneath
   traditionally accepted thresholds (< 0.05, < 0.01, < 0.001, < 0.0001);
   we examine how these thresholds influence the distribution of reported
   absolute P-values in published scientific papers, the majority in
   biological sciences. We collected published P-values from three leading
   journals, and summarized their distribution using the frequencies
   falling across and within these four threshold values between 0.05 and
   0. These published frequencies were then fitted to three complementary
   null models which allowed us to predict the expected proportions of
   P-values in the top and bottom half of each inter-threshold interval
   (i.e. those lying below, as opposed to above, each P-value threshold).
   Statistical comparison of these predicted proportions, against those
   actually observed, provides the first empirical evidence for a
   remarkable excess of probability values being cited on, or just below,
   each threshold relative to the smoothed theoretical distributions. The
   pattern is consistent across thresholds and journals, and for whichever

Abstract = {{Despite prevalent use of anthropogenic structures by bats and the
   associated implications for public health, management, and bat
   conservation, very little quantitative information exists about urban
   roost characteristics and their selection by bats. During the summers of
   2001 to 2004 we conducted fieldwork in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA,
   situated on the northern end of Colorado's Front Range, to address
   questions of roost selection by the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus).
   The city has experienced its greatest growth in the past half century,
   with its population increasing by 30\% in the last decade. Similar
   growth in new buildings has occurred, with the number of new housing
   permits issued annually doubling in the past decade. We located 142
   roosts using radiotelemetry or by citizen calls in response to a
   newspaper article and flyers. To determine characteristics of roost
   selectivity by bats, we compared variables for known maternity roosts
   and randomly selected buildings at microhabitat and landscape scales
   using logistic regression; we used an information theoretic approach to
   determine which variables were most important. We considered 44 and 100
   buildings in the microhabitat and landscape scale analyses,
   respectively. At the microhabitat scale maternity roosts had exit points
   with larger areas that were higher from the ground and had warmer
   average temperatures than randomly selected buildings. At the landscape
   scale distances to similarly categorized roosts were smaller, and
   urbanization variables such as lower building density, higher street
   density, and lower traffic count density were most important. Results
   for variables important to urban-roosting big brown bats were often
   analogous to studies that characterized maternity roosts found in tree
   snags and rock crevices. In addition, changes in the landscape, not only
   in the form of anthropogenic structures but also in water availability
   and vegetation structure such as riparian forests, may have led to
   population increases and range expansions of the big brown bat. Because
   big brown bats appear to selectively choose specific combinations of
   characteristics found at maternity roosts, not all available structures
   can be considered suitable and exclusion from established maternity
   roosts may negatively impact bat populations.}},

   in 1977, 1990 and 2000. Sapling growth within 25 treefall gaps was
   sampled all three times. Canopy trees were measured using the
   point-centered quarter method, with 83 points sampled all three times.
   Gap regeneration increased significantly in density and basal area from
   1977-1990. Beech (Fagus grandifolia) significantly increased its
   relative gap sapling density from 68\% to 91\% to 94\% over the 3 y.
   Other species decreased in absolute numbers presumably due to deer
   browsing. Canopy tree density remained constant and basal area increased
   1977-1990 but both decreased 1990-2000. Species relative density and
   basal area values did not change. Mortality rates almost doubled from
   1977-1990 to 1990-2000, increasing especially for smaller canopy trees.
   Snag densities and formation rates also increased, though not
   significantly, from the first to the second time interval. Beech, in
   particular, showed large increases in mortality, probably due to the
   growing impact of beech bark disease, which reached the stand about
   1990. The stand seems changing to a new state with less beech in the
   canopy and more in the understory. Which species will replace beech in
   the canopy is difficult to predict.}},

Abstract = {{Primary tropical forests are renowned for their high biodiversity and
   carbon storage, and considerable research has documented both species
   and carbon losses with deforestation and agricultural land uses.
   Economic drivers are now leading to the abandonment of agricultural
   lands, and the area in secondary forests is increasing. We know little
   about how long it takes for these ecosystems to achieve the structural
   and compositional characteristics of primary forests. In this study, we
   examine changes in plant species composition and aboveground biomass
   during eight decades of tropical secondary succession in Puerto Rico,
   and compare these patterns with primary forests. Using a well-replicated
   chronosequence approach, we sampled primary forests and secondary
   forests established 10, 20, 30, 60, and 80 years ago on abandoned
   pastures. Tree species composition in all secondary forests was
   different from that of primary forests and could be divided into early
   (10-, 20-, and 30-year) vs. late (60- and 80-year) successional phases.
   The highest rates of aboveground biomass accumulation occurred in the
   first 20 years, with rates of C sequestration peaking at 6.7 +/- 0.5 Mg
   C (.) ha(-1) (.) yr(-1). Reforestation of pastures resulted in an
   accumulation of 125 Mg C/ha in aboveground standing live biomass over 80
   years. The 80 year-old secondary forests had greater biomass than the
   primary forests, due to the replacement of woody species by palms in the
   primary forests. Our results show that these new ecosystems have
   different species composition, but similar species richness, and
   significant potential for carbon sequestration, compared to remnant
   primary forests.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting population dynamics is a fundamental problem in applied
   ecology. Temperature is a potential driver of short-term population
   dynamics, and temperature data are widely available, but we generally
   lack validated models to predict dynamics based upon temperatures. A
   generalized approach involves estimating the temperatures experienced by
   a population, characterizing the demographic consequences of
   physiological responses to temperature, and testing for predicted
   effects on abundance. We employed this approach to test whether minimum
   winter temperatures are a meaningful driver of pestilence from
   Dendroctonus frontalis ( the southern pine beetle) across the
   southeastern United States. A distance-weighted interpolation model
   provided good, spatially explicit, predictions of minimum winter air
   temperatures ( a putative driver of beetle survival). A Newtonian heat
   transfer model with empirical cooling constants indicated that beetles
   within host trees are buffered from the lowest air temperatures by;
   similar to 1-4 degrees C ( depending on tree diameter and duration of
   cold bout). The life stage structure of beetles in the most northerly
   outbreak in recent times ( New Jersey) were dominated by prepupae, which
   were more cold tolerant (by > 3 degrees C) than other life stages.
   Analyses of beetle abundance data from 1987 to 2005 showed that minimum
   winter air temperature only explained 1.5\% of the variance in
   interannual growth rates of beetle populations, indicating that it is
   but a weak driver of population dynamics in the southeastern United
   States as a whole. However, average population growth rate matched
   theoretical predictions of a process-based model of winter mortality
   from low temperatures; apparently our knowledge of population effects
   from winter temperatures is satisfactory, and may help to predict
   dynamics of northern populations, even while adding little to population
   predictions in southern forests. Recent episodes of D. frontalis
   outbreaks in northern forests may have been allowed by a warming trend
   from 1960 to 2004 of 3.3 degrees C in minimum winter air temperatures in
   the southeastern United States. Studies that combine climatic analyses,
   physiological experiments, and spatially replicated time series of
   population abundance can improve population predictions, contribute to a
   synthesis of population and physiological ecology, and aid in assessing
   the ecological consequences of climatic trends.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable land use under climate change requires detailed knowledge of
   the system dynamics. This applies particularly for the management of
   domestic livestock in semi-arid and arid grazing systems, where the risk
   of degradation is high and likely climate change may have a strong
   impact. A suitable way to assess potential future trends of these
   complex systems is through the application of simulation models.
   We reviewed 41 models published between 1995 and 2005 simulating
   semi-arid and arid livestock grazing systems. The models were
   categorized according to the model aim and type, their temporal and
   spatial scale, and several indicators of model complexity. Additionally,
   we developed a list of model requirements for adequately simulating the
   effects of climate change. Based on these requirements, we evaluated the
   potential of current models to simulate impacts of climate change and
   determine important shortcomings.
   Three general model types could be distinguished, namely state and
   transition, difference and differential equation, and rule-based models.
   Over time, we found that the number of models aiming to improve
   management strategies increased, while there were fewer models that
   aimed to understand system dynamics. This was accompanied by a trend to
   simplify model descriptions of hydrological relationships.
   Important shortcomings of current models included the impact of
   increased CO2 levels on plant productivity and the ability to resolve
   changes in intra-annual precipitation patterns. The consideration of
   both external drivers is crucial under climate change, hence sustainable
   long-term decision making is currently lacking important information.
   Synthesis and applications. Sustainable livestock management in
   semi-arid and arid systems requires knowledge about effects of future
   climate change to adjust livestock density adequately. Producers'
   experiences from current weather conditions are not necessarily
   transferable to future conditions, thus models could help to support
   management. However, an analysis of current models has shown that few
   existing models are able to assess the impacts of the predicted climate
   change. Therefore, we call for the development of new dynamic grazing
   models that provide land managers with the necessary tools to face the
   threat of future climate changes.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The cosmopolitan genus Herbertus is notorious for having a difficult
   taxonomy and for the fact that there is limited knowledge of species
   ranges and relationships. Topologies generated from variable molecular
   markers are used to discuss biogeographical patterns in Herbertus and to
   compare them with the geological history of continents and outcomes
   reported for other land plants.
   Location Africa, Asia, Azores, Europe, southern South America, northern
   South America, North America, New Zealand.
   Methods Phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed
   spacer and chloroplast (cp) trnL-trnF sequences of 66 accessions of
   Herbertus and the outgroup species Triandrophyllum subtrifidum and
   Mastigophora diclados were used to investigate biogeographical patterns
   in Herbertus. Areas of putative endemism were defined based on the
   distribution of species included in the analyses. Maximum parsimony
   analyses were undertaken to reconstruct ancestral areas and intraspecies
   migration routes.
   Results The analyses reveal species-level cladograms with a correlation
   between genetic variation and the geographical distribution of the
   related accessions. The southern South American Herbertus runcinatus is
   sister to the remainder of the genus, which is split into two main
   clades. One contains the Neotropical-African Herbertus juniperoideus and
   the New Zealand/Tasmanian Herbertus oldfieldianus. An African accession
   of H. juniperoideus is nested within Neotropical accessions. The second
   main clade includes species that inhabit Asia, the Holarctic, Africa,
   and northern South America. Maximum parsimony analyses indicate that
   this clade arose in Asia. Herbertus sendtneri originated in Asia and
   subsequently colonized the Holarctic and northern South America. An
   Asian origin and colonization into Africa is indicated for H. dicranus.
   Main conclusions The current distribution of Herbertus cannot be
   explained by Gondwanan vicariance. A more feasible explanation of the
   range is a combination of short-distance dispersal, rare long-distance
   dispersal events (especially into regions that faced floral
   displacements as a result of climatic changes) extinction,
   recolonization, and diversification. The African Herbertus flora is a
   mixture of Asian and Neotropical elements. Southern South America
   harbours an isolated species. The molecular data indicate partial
   decoupling of molecular and morphological variation in Herbertus.
   Biogeographical patterns in Herbertus are not dissimilar to those of
   other groups of bryophytes, but elucidation of the geographical ranges
   requires a molecular approach. Some patterns could be the result of
   maintenance of Herbertus in the inner Tropics during glacial maxima, and
   dispersal into temperate regions in warm phases.}},

Abstract = {{A one spatial-box version of the NEMURO oceanic lower trophic food web
   model was applied to a coastal upwelling environment typified by West
   Coast Vancouver Island. We used both ad hoc calibration and the
   automatic calibration program PEST. NEMURO was first calibrated to I
   year of monthly field data using the usual ad hoc approach of trial and
   error changes to 18 candidate parameters. Four PEST calibrations were
   then performed. The first three PEST calibrations used model predictions
   in year 10 from the ad hoc calibration as data in a twin experiment
   design; the fourth PEST calibration repeated the ad hoc procedure by
   having PEST calibrate NEMURO to the field data. When provided with ad
   hoc calibration model predictions as data, PEST accurately recovered the
   known 18 parameter values, even when small and large phytoplankton were
   lumped into total phytoplankton. When 57 parameters were allowed to vary
   PEST-estimated-reasonable values for all 57 parameters, but they
   differed from the ad hoc calibrated values. However, when applied to the
   field data, PEST-estimated parameter values that differed greatly from
   the ad hoc values. The PEST calibration fitted some of the field data
   better than the ad hoc calibration but at the cost of unequal small and
   large phytoplankton concentrations. Thus, with proper and careful
   implementation, PEST offers a viable approach for objective calibration
   of NEMURO to site-specific monitoring data. We recommend that automatic
   calibration methods, such as PEST, be used for application of the NEMURO
   model to new locations. When the field data allow for specification of
   time series for each phytoplankton and zooplankton state variable, PEST
   will provide an objective, defensible, and repeatable way to calibrate
   the many parameters of the NEMURO model. If the available data are
   insufficient for specification of each state variable, then ad hoc
   calibration will likely be needed to allow for inclusion of qualitative
   decisions about model fit. Use of PEST in this situation will provide
   better understanding of the data-model mis-matches and will provide an
   alternative calibration to the necessary, but subjective, ad hoc
   calibration. Comparison of the ad hoc and PEST calibrations (even if
   unsuccessful) will help in the interpretation of the ad hoc calibration.
   Robust parameter estimation by any method depends on the quality and
   consistency of the calibration dataset. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{NEMURO, the North Pacific Ecosystem Model for Understanding Regional
   oceanography, simulates the temporal evolution and dynamics of the North
   Pacific's nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton food web. The approach of
   developing a single model formulation allowed quantitative comparisons
   across various locations and time periods. Building on a common
   foundation enabled the linkages between lower trophic levels to the
   higher trophic (fish) components to proceed systematically. NEMURO was
   extended to NEMUROTISH by using the lower trophic level output of NEMURO
   as input to a bioenergetic-based model of fish growth and population
   dynamics. This paper summarizes the contributions of individual papers
   that comprise this issue of Ecological Modelling and that all used the
   NEMURO family of models. Contributions represent a rich set of
   case-studies and in-depth modeling studies focused on the North Pacific
   that addressed: oceanic biogeochemistry, regional and seasonal
   variability of phytoplankton and zooplankton, reconstruction of 40-50
   years of plankton dynamics, effects of climate on herring and saury
   growth and population dynamics, the feasibility of automatic calibration
   methods, the sensitivity of the model to parameter values, and
   projections of future states of the ecosystem under global warming. Next
   steps in the evolution of NEMURO are suggested and include increased
   resolution of the physical model underlying NEMURO, the addition of new
   biological state variables at the lower trophic levels to better
   represent the diversity of oceanic species and their potential for
   different responses under changing environmental conditions, and the
   addition of more higher trophic level species to allow for
   inter-specific (competition and predation) interactions. The NEMURO
   effort involved a diverse group of researchers working jointly on a
   common problem for several years. Consequently, the resulting
   contributions, even at the level of the individual papers, provide a
   broader perspective and integration of the results than would have

Abstract = {{Lacunarity results can be skewed by edge effects and this may have
   negative implications for research projects in ecological pattern
   analysis and modeling. The problem occurs because the standard
   gliding-box algorithm over-samples the center of a map and under-samples
   along its edges. This effect is particularly strong when the scale of
   inquiry is large relative to the extent of the map, as fewer box mass
   estimates are utilized to form the distribution from which lacunarity is
   calculated. We devised a new algorithm where we allowed the gliding-box
   to overlap beyond the edge of the map and wrap back around to the
   opposing side, thereby solving both problems. In this study, we compare
   the standard lacunarity algorithm with this new periodic boundary
   algorithm (a method often used in cellular automata modeling) to
   quantify the differences between the two approaches and to determine
   when the standard algorithm may suffer from deleterious effects. We
   performed our analysis upon several neutral landscapes to evaluate the
   importance of pattern as well. We found that the standard algorithm
   skews results when the pattern is strongly heterogeneous or aggregated,
   especially when the classes are not evenly distributed around the center
   of the map or when percent cover pi is low. The advantages and

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to determine the effect of new agri-approaches
   on possible future land-use changes. We analysed the construction of
   these post-classical approaches in agriculture management. The
   post-classical approach to agriculture stresses the leading role of the
   global environment as a potential tool for formulating new
   agro-scenarios integrating local landscapes and the global environment.
   The emerging construction of post-classical agri-approaches may be
   viewed as a kind of turning point in agriculture. In the presented
   example, the real role of agriculture was meant to consider agriculture
   as an appropriate tool to buffer the effects of global environmental
   changes. However, a large share of anthropogenic emissions is derived
   from agriculture. To make agriculture an ecological tool for the
   absorption of CO, requires not only a lot of research to measure this
   effect, but also social and political conviction about this approach. It
   also requires a broader definition of agriculture than the current one
   of food production and local social and environmental values.
   In this example, an offer was made to stakeholders in the form of
   agro-subsidies for forestation and grasslands so to diminish CO, levels
   over the next 10 years in Nove Hrady, Czech Republic, a more or less
   representative ``neutral{''} rural area in Central Europe. The
   stakeholders represented all land-use interests as much as possible. In
   general, the results revealed a relatively great sensitivity of land use
   in response to post-classical agro-scenarios and showed that application
   of this kind of agro-tool could be possible at the landscape scale. The
   estimation of land-type proportion showed a relatively great loss of
   arable land. The scenario concerned with the possibility of increased
   CO, absorption by forestation showed relatively large increases in
   forests, while the scenario ``grassland{''} could be important in
   affecting biodiversity, because of the considerable increased number of
   patches. These are general tendencies more than any exact percentage of
   land-use proportion. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Declines in many native fish populations have led to reassessments of
   management goals and shifted priorities from consumptive uses to species
   preservation. As management has shifted, relevant environmental
   characteristics have evolved from traditional metrics that described
   local habitat quality to characterizations of habitat size and
   connectivity. Despite the implications this shift has for how habitats
   may be prioritized for conservation, it has been rare to assess the
   relative importance of these habitat components. We used an information
   - theoretic approach to select the best models from sets of logistic
   regressions that linked habitat quality, size, and connectivity to the
   occurrence of chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) nests. Spawning
   distributions were censused annually from 1995 to 2004, and data were
   complemented with field measurements that described habitat quality in
   43 suitable spawning patches across a stream network that drained 1150
   km(2) in central Idaho. Results indicated that the most plausible models
   were dominated by measures of habitat size and connectivity, whereas
   habitat quality was of minor importance. Connectivity was the strongest
   predictor of nest occurrence, but connectivity interacted with habitat
   size, which became relatively more important when populations were
   reduced. Comparison of observed nest distributions to null model
   predictions confirmed that the habitat size association was driven by a
   biological mechanism when populations were small, but this association
   may have been an area- related sampling artifact at higher abundances.
   The implications for habitat management are that the size and
   connectivity of existing habitat networks should be maintained whenever
   possible. In situations where habitat restoration is occurring,
   expansion of existing areas or creation of new habitats in key areas
   that increase connectivity may be beneficial. Information about habitat
   size and connectivity also could be used to strategically prioritize
   areas for improvement of local habitat quality, with areas not meeting
   minimum thresholds being deemed inappropriate for pursuit of restoration
   activities.}},

Title = {{Spatial patterns and vegetation-site relationships of the presettlement

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Aim The purposes of this study were to develop a Geographic Information
   System and spatial analytical methodology to reconstruct and represent
   the presettlement vegetation in a spatially continuous manner over large
   areas and to investigate vegetation-site relationships before widespread
   changes of the vegetation had taken place.
   Location The study area was the Holland Land Company Purchase in western
   New York, a 14,400 km(2) area extending across the physiographic
   provinces of the Erie-Ontario Lowlands and the Appalachian Uplands.
   Methods Bearing-tree records from the Holland Land Company township
   surveys of western New York in c. 1800 were collected and analysed. The
   geostatistical method of indicator kriging was used to map spatially
   continuous representations of individual tree species. Rule-based and
   statistically clustered approaches were used to analyse and classify the
   reconstructed tree species distributions in order to obtain the
   vegetation association distribution. Contingency table analysis was
   conducted to quantify species relationships with soil conditions.
   Results The presettlement vegetation at both the tree species and the
   vegetation association levels were easier to interpret and visually more
   effective as a spatially continuous representation than as a
   discontinuous distribution of symbols. The results for tree species were
   probability occurrences of species distribution, showing spatial
   patterns that were not apparent in discrete maps of points or in summary
   tables of species frequencies. Analysis of the 8792 bearing trees
   suggested the dominance of American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and sugar
   maple (Acer saccharum) in the forest composition 200 years ago. Both
   soil drainage and texture were important site determinants of the
   vegetation in western New York. The rule-based and statistically
   clustered approaches had the advantage of summarizing vegetation
   compositional patterns in a single image, thus avoiding the need to
   delineate manually and subjectively the location of boundaries between
   adjacent vegetation associations.
   Main Conclusions The study offers more insights into the spatial pattern
   of presettlement forests in western New York than do prior studies. The
   spatially continuous representation could also enable the comparison of
   vegetation distribution from data sources that have different sampling
   schemes, for example the comparison of presettlement vegetation from the
   presettlement land survey records with current vegetation from modern
   forest inventories. The results are of value, providing a useful
   benchmark against which to examine vegetation change and the impacts of
   human land use.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{235-240}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In response to my essay review that attempted to reconcile the plant
   strategy theories of Grime and Tilman, Grime rejects five tenets that I
   had identified in his theories that were incomplete, inconsistent, or
   incorrect.
   Grime fails to adequately address three of these concerns. Regarding the
   other concerns, it is clear that the concept of relative importance
   needs to be developed further. For example, if both competition and the
   stress of low nutrient supplies can remove species from a given
   environment, then neither can be elevated over the other without being
   tautological.
   With regards to Tilman's response, it is clear that it will be important
   to be explicit about the relationship between data and models. At times,
   Tilman is neither evaluating individual models with a Popperian approach
   nor comparing contrasting models in a Bayesian fashion. As it stands, it
   is unclear what is required for Tilman to reject R{*} as the mechanism
   of competition, or whether it passes some undetermined threshold of
   acceptability.
   Comparing concentration reduction to supply pre-emption as the mechanism
   of competition recommends supply pre-emption on many fronts. Supply
   pre-emption better represents the movement of nutrients in soil
   solution. Assuming well-mixed soil solutions can theoretically lead to
   improper prediction of competitive outcomes. Empirically, there are
   examples where R{*} does not predict outcomes for competition for
   nutrients, and supply pre-emption appears to generate metrics (root
   length density) that are equivalent if not better than concentration
   reduction (R{*}) at explaining these outcomes.
   The next plant strategies paradigm will not be a result of choosing
   either Grime's or Tilman's theories, but represent a synthesis of the
   two sets of theories while also incorporating novel concepts and
   research. I agree with Tilman that more research is needed in
   understanding mechanisms of coexistence, but there still remains large
   gaps in our understanding of plant traits and growth that limit our
   understanding of competition for nutrients and will likely constrain our
   understanding of coexistence even more.}},

Abstract = {{Expansion of the nature conservation estate in northeastern New South
   Wales, Australia, has captured weed-infested timber plantations amid a
   mosaic of high conservation value lands. We adopted a
   state-and-transition approach to test the hypothesis that restoration
   barriers restrict the natural regeneration of native species in
   Eucalyptus grandis plantations infested by Lantana camara in Bongil
   Bongil National Park, New South Wales. Plantation tree thinning and weed
   control were applied in factorial combination at three sites (totaling
   to 4.5 ha). Topsoil chemistry responses to these interventions were
   attributable to the ``ash bed{''} effect, with temporary increases in
   topsoil pH(W) and nitrate, particularly where canopy reduction was
   greatest. Other soil changes were minor, indicating that thinning and
   burning did not risk soil degradation. Plant species richness and
   functional group representation in the regenerating understorey were
   improved by the interventions. Regeneration of native potential canopy
   trees, understorey trees, shrubs and woody climbers, and perennial forbs
   all increased with canopy retention. Grass cover dominated the
   regeneration where canopy cover was less than 50\%. In the absence of
   weed control, the cover of introduced shrubs increased with reduction in
   canopy cover, as did the rate of understorey regeneration generally.
   These responses indicate that thinning and weed control can reinstate
   succession, leading to structurally and compositionally diverse forest.
   Given the abundance of native woody regeneration under retained canopy,
   the lantana understorey was more important in inhibiting native
   regeneration. The experimental approach will promote efficient use of
   resources across the remaining 200 ha of low conservation value
   plantations in this national park.}},

Volume = {{201}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Regulation of interannual phenological variability is an important
   component of climate and ecological models. Prior phenological efforts
   using the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) as a proxy of
   vegetation dynamics have often simulated spring events only or failed to
   simulate interannual variability. Our aim is to address these
   shortcomings and to use the AVHRR to develop prognostic models for
   interannual land surface phenology and, critically, to test whether or
   not the developed models are superior to use of climatological phenology
   values from the AVHRR. Using datasets for the conterminous United
   States, we first filtered data to select regions and plant functional
   types for which the best-possible remotely sensed signal could be
   obtained. We then used a generalized linear model approach to model the
   relationship between an integrative productivity index and estimates of
   the start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) derived from the
   AVHRR, yielding models capable of prognostically predicting SOS/EOS
   events independently of satellite data. Mean absolute errors between the
   model-predicted and AVHRR-observed SOS/EOS ranged from 5.1 to 20.3 days.
   SOS errors were uniformly lower than EOS errors. SOS models for the
   deciduous broadleaf forest and grassland plant functional types produced
   lower errors than use of the climatological SOS values while all other
   models produced errors higher than those obtained from the
   climatological dates. Based on this criterion for success, we suggest
   that the AVHRR may not be appropriate for further development of
   prognostic land surface phenology models. However, an intercomparison of
   phenological dates from an independent spring index model, our model
   predictions, and the AVHRR observations indicated that interannual
   predictions from our models may be superior to the satellite data upon
   which they are based, implying that a further comparison between models
   based on the AVHRR and newer, superior sensors, should be conducted. (c)

Abstract = {{The goal of the Europe-wide conservation programme Natura-2000 is to
   ensure the conservation of both key habitat types and species.
   Natura-2000 articulates a Europe-wide vision, and the strategic level
   policy decisions will undoubtedly draw upon regional (national)
   statistics. At this time neither standardised methods nor funds have
   been found for essential recurrent small area monitoring. At this time
   neither standardised method for small area monitoring has been adopted,
   nor have funds been allocated for such efforts. We use an open raised
   bog in Austria's Salzburg Province as an example, and advocate a
   landscape analysis-based monitoring solution which can utilise
   historical data in combination with modern remotely sensed data sources,
   geo-visualisation, and landscape metrics analyses. In this paper, we
   augment a historical range of variability (HRV) assessment made from an
   aerial photograph time series with additional disturbance state
   representations created using photo-realistic visualisation. We
   introduce an object-based approach to historical/scenario landscape
   analyses and the use of a novel vector-based landscape metric tool. We
   assess the potential of structural metrics to assist in the
   quantification of site status by experimenting with several landscape
   metrics on the historical and simulated representations.
   The methodology is used to successfully quantify a trend of encroachment
   by heather and woody vegetation that is consistent with existing
   literature, and to provide a basis for further analysis. The landscape
   metrics applied show a marked increase in ``bush-encroached bog{''} via
   the degradation gradient, as well as a decrease in the remaining core
   area of undisturbed ``open raised bog{''}. Results of a patch isolation
   analysis show an increase in both fraumentation and isolation of
   remaining patches of ``open raised bog{''} area. Landscape metrics are
   useful for documentation of the structural consequences of changes in
   the bog, but must be applied with considerable care and rigor in order
   to indicate habitat conservation status. In our study, generalised
   landscape metrics evidence various deficiencies in terms of calculation
   or interpretability, ambiguity in interpretation, detailed species
   knowledge required for meaningful parameterisation, dependence on
   thematic resolution, and quality of the underlying classification. (c)

Abstract = {{In sitit farm-scale measurements are a prerequisite for improving the

   changes made to the process-based model NZ-DNDC to allow us to simulate
   emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from typical New Zealand grazed
   grassland soils, and subsequent improvements to account for periodic
   changes in pasture growth, N input from animals, and water balance/soil

   spatially due to uneven excretal N inputs, and seasonally due to
   climatic conditions. The model was validated against field measurements

   The model simulated effectively most of the soil water-filled pore-space
   (WFPS) and the general pulses and trends in NO emission from both the
   sheep- and dairy-grazed pastures, and also captured the observed effects
   of excretal and fertiliser N inputs. It also fairly reproduced the real
   variability in underlying processes regulating N2O emissions. A series
   of sensitivity tests conducted on NZ-DNDC showed the model predicted
   changes in pasture production and N2O emissions with changes in climate,
   soil properties, fertiliser management and grazing regimes. Pasture
   production was more sensitive to rainfall, temperature and initial soil
   carbon levels than to fertiliser additions, and stocking rate while NO
   emissions were strongly sensitive to rainfall, quantity and frequency of
   N inputs through both fertiliser and increased stocking rate, and

Abstract = {{We analyzed whether habitat deterioration due to ski slopes affected
   lizards' behavior, and whether these changes in behavior had
   consequences for the body condition and health state of lizards. Results
   suggested that habitat deterioration in ski slopes not only implied a
   loss of optimal habitat for lizards, but also led to an increase in
   perceived risk of predation. Males seemed to adjust their movement
   patterns to differences in risk, increasing their movement speed during
   their displacements across risky areas within ski slopes, but as a
   consequence, they incurred loss of body condition. A laboratory
   experiment supported that fleeing at high speeds in areas without
   refuges can be a factor responsible for reduced body condition. However,
   changes in body condition did not affect sprint speed of lizards. Our
   study provides new evidence that behavioral strategies to cope with
   increased predation risk, due to human-induced habitat deterioration,
   may affect body condition of lizards. Our results have applications for
   the design of conservation plans for this endangered lizard species.
   Environmental impact studies should be performed before opening new ski
   slopes, but taking into account not only the presence of lizards but
   also their body condition. An effective way to decrease the effects of
   habitat loss may be the artificial restoration of some refuges to create
   safe corridors for movement. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{134}},

Abstract = {{As the area of the world's forests shrinks, the management of production
   forests is becoming increasingly paramount for biodiversity
   conservation. In the United States and Australia, public debate and
   controversy about the management of production forests during the later
   decades of the 20th century resulted in governments adopting sweeping
   top-down changes to forest policy, with regional forest plans a
   cornerstone of this process. This paper reviews the biodiversity
   conservation outcomes of two such processes, the Southeast Queensland
   Forests Agreement (Australia) and the Northwest Forest Plan (United
   States). Several key lessons are identified. First, these plans are
   significant steps forward in the struggle to conserve forest
   biodiversity while providing for production of timber. Second, expanding
   the conservation reserve system by itself does not necessarily ensure
   biodiversity conservation, especially if reserves are traded off for
   increased timber harvesting in forests outside of reserves or if certain
   important elements of biodiversity are not accounted for either by
   conservation forests or production forests. Third, reserves often need
   active management to restore diversity in previously-logged forests and
   reduce fuels that have accumulated as a result of fire exclusion.
   Fourth, the current plans fall short of the comprehensive
   whole-of-landscape, multiple-ownership approach needed to support
   long-term sustainable forestry and biodiversity conservation. Fifth,
   adaptive management was not adequately institutionalized and sometimes
   misapplied, although, in the case of the Pacific Northwest, a major
   regional monitoring strategy was developed and partially implemented.
   Finally, ecological science suffered in the collision with the
   socio-political decision-making process due to the limited scope that
   was left for testing and evaluating the new approaches to forest
   management. We conclude, based on the evaluation of the two regional
   plans, that regional biodiversity conservation goals may be better
   achieved by implementing sustainable forest management practices across
   all ownerships and involving all stakeholders and the broader community.

Abstract = {{This paper reports a bioclimatic envelope model study of the potential
   distribution of 19 tree species in the Iberian Peninsula during the Last
   Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21 000 yr BP) and the Mid-Holocene (6000 yr BP).
   Current patterns of tree species richness and distributions are believed
   to have been strongly influenced by the climate during these periods.
   The modelling employed novel machine learning techniques, and its
   accuracy was evaluated using a threshold-independent method. Two
   atmospheric general circulation models, UGAMP and ECHAM3 (generated by
   the Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project, PMIP), were used to
   provide climate scenarios under which the distributions of the 19 tree
   species were modelled. The results obtained for these scenarios were
   assessed by agreement measure analysis; they differed significantly for
   the LGM, but were more similar for the Mid-Holocene.
   The results for the LGM support the inferred importance of pines in the
   Iberian Peninsula at this time, and the presence of evergreen Quercus in
   the south. Important differences in the altitude at which the modelled
   species grew were also predicted. During the LGM, some normally higher
   mountain species potentially became re-established in the foothills of
   the Pyrenees. The warm Mid-Holocene climate is clearly reflected in the
   predicted expansion of broad-leaved forests during this period,
   including the colonization of the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula

Title = {{Seed mass, shape, and persistence in the soil seed bank of Israeli
   coastal sand dune flora}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{325-340}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Question: Are seed mass and shape related to persistence in the soil
   seed bank among 54 species of the Israeli flora?
   Search method: Persistence was determined by soil seed bank
   investigations in which the fraction of non-germinated viable seeds was
   regarded as the persistent soil seed bank. When seedling emergence had
   ceased but before new seeds were shed, all soil from the upper 5 cm of
   120 quadrats was removed to the laboratory. At that time, the seeds
   sampled were those from previous seed rains.
   Data description: Plant species with persistent and transient seeds were
   widely scattered across the range of seed mass or dimension and
   variances. A significant relationship was found between seed mass (or
   dimension) and seed persistence with persistent seeds tending to have
   larger mass. However, no significant relationship was found between seed
   shape and seed persistence. Species with persistent seeds had
   significantly higher seed mass than those with transient seeds
   (one-tailed t-test = 1.68, n = 48, P = 0.007), but there was no
   significant difference in shape between them (one-tailed t-test = 1.68,
   n = 48, P = 0.076; t-test = 1.68, n = 45, P = 0.124). Species with
   persistent seeds yielded significantly higher seed dimensions than those
   with transient seeds (one-tailed t-test = 1.95, n = 48, P = 0.029). In
   this study, there was no threshold in seed mass (or dimension) and shape
   that distinguished transient from persistent seeds.
   Conclusions: Species with persistent seeds have significantly larger
   seeds than species with transient seeds. However, species with small
   and/or round persistent seeds were relatively common. The underlying
   mechanism proposed for the observed pattern is a high proportion of
   large-seeded, persistent species with hard seed coat dormancy and
   abundant litter on the surface of the soil. Data from all eight floras
   studied to date suggest that significant differences in climate may
   determine diverse patterns in the relationships between seed mass and
   shape and persistence. Small and compact seeds are likely to occur in
   soil seed banks in humid climates, whereas large-seeded species with
   persistent seed banks are more likely to be abundant in arid climates.

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic perturbations have profoundly modified the Earth's
   biogeochemical cycles, the most prominent of these changes being
   manifested by global carbon (C) cycling. We investigated long-term
   effects of human-induced land-use and land-cover changes from native
   tropical forest (Kenya) and subtropical grassland (South Africa)
   ecosystems to agriculture on the dynamics and structural composition of
   soil organic C (SOC) using elemental analysis and integrated C-13
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), near-edge X-ray absorption fine
   structure (NEXAFS) and synchrotron-based Fourier transform
   infrared-attenuated total reflectance (Sr-FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy.
   Anthropogenic interventions led to the depletion of 76\%, 86\% and 67\%
   of the total SOC; and 77\%, 85\% and 66\% of the N concentrations from
   the surface soils of Nandi, Kakamega and the South African sites,
   respectively, over a period of up to 100 years. Significant proportions
   of the total SOC (46-73\%) and N (37-73\%) losses occurred during the
   first 4 years of conversion indicating that these forest- and
   grassland-derived soils contain large amounts of labile soil organic
   matter (SOM), potentially vulnerable to degradation upon human-induced
   land-use and land-cover changes. Anthropogenic perturbations altered not
   only the C sink capacity of these soils, but also the functional group
   composition and dynamics of SOC with time, rendering structural
   composition of the resultant organic matter in the agricultural soils to
   be considerably different from the SOM under natural forest and
   grassland ecosystems. These molecular level compositional changes were
   manifested: (i) by the continued degradation of O-alkyl and acetal-C
   structures found in carbohydrate and holocellulose biomolecules, some
   labile aliphatic-C functionalities, (ii) by side-chain oxidation of
   phenylpropane units of lignin and (iii) by the continued aromatization
   and aliphatization of the humic fractions possibly through selective
   accumulation of recalcitrant H and C substituted aryl-C and aliphatic-C
   components such as (poly)-methylene units, respectively. These changes
   appeared as early as the fourth year after transition, and their
   intensity increased with duration of cultivation until a new
   quasi-equilibrium of SOC was approached at about 20 years after
   conversion. However, subtle but persistent changes in molecular
   structures of the resultant SOM continued long after (up to 100 years) a
   steady state for SOC was approached. These molecular level changes in
   the inherent structural composition of SOC may exert considerable
   influence on biogeochemical cycling of C and bioavailability of
   essential nutrients present in association with SOM, and may
   significantly affect the sustainability of agriculture as well as
   potentials of the soils to sequester C in these tropical and subtropical
   highland agroecosystems.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{95-104}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Recent changes in European agricultural policy have led to measures
   to reverse the loss of species-rich grasslands through the creation of
   new areas on ex-arable land. Ex-arable soils are often characterized by
   high inorganic nitrogen (N) levels, which lead to the rapid
   establishment of annual and fast-growing perennial species during the
   initial phase of habitat creation. The addition of carbon (C) to the
   soil has been suggested as a countermeasure to reduce plant-available N
   and alter competitive interactions among plant species.
   2. To test the effect of C addition on habitat creation on ex-arable
   land, an experiment was set up on two recently abandoned fields in
   Switzerland and on two 6-year-old restoration sites in the UK. Carbon
   was added as a mixture of either sugar and sawdust or wood chips and
   sawdust during a period of 2 years. The effects of C addition on soil
   parameters and vegetation composition were assessed during the period of
   C additions and 1 year thereafter.
   3. Soil nitrate concentrations were reduced at all sites within weeks of
   the first C addition, and remained low until cessation of the C
   additions. The overall effect of C addition on vegetation was a
   reduction in above-ground biomass and cover. At the Swiss sites, the
   addition of sugar and sawdust led to a relative increase in legume and
   forb cover and to a decrease in grass cover. The soil N availability,
   composition of soil micro-organisms and vegetation characteristics
   continued to be affected after cessation of C additions.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The results suggest that C addition in
   grassland restoration is a useful management method to reduce N
   availability on ex-arable land. Carbon addition alters the vegetation
   composition by creating gaps in the vegetation that facilitates the
   establishment of late-seral plant species, and is most effective when
   started immediately after the abandonment of arable fields and applied
   over several years.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Forest restoration in ponderosa pine and mixed ponderosa
   pine-Douglas fir forests in the US Rocky Mountains has been highly
   influenced by a historical model of frequent, low-severity surface fires
   developed for the ponderosa pine forests of the Southwestern USA. A
   restoration model, based on this low-severity fire model, focuses on
   thinning and prescribed burning to restore historical forest structure.
   However, in the US Rocky Mountains, research on fire history and forest
   structure, and early historical reports, suggest the low-severity model
   may only apply in limited geographical areas. The aim of this article is
   to elaborate a new variable-severity fire model and evaluate the
   applicability of this model, along with the low-severity model, for the
   ponderosa pine-Douglas fir forests of the Rocky Mountains.
   Location Rocky Mountains, USA.
   Methods The geographical applicability of the two fire models is
   evaluated using historical records, fire histories and forest
   age-structure analyses.
   Results Historical sources and tree-ring reconstructions document that,
   near or before AD 1900, the low-severity model may apply in dry,
   low-elevation settings, but that fires naturally varied in severity in
   most of these forests. Low-severity fires were common, but high-severity
   fires also burned thousands of hectares. Tree regeneration increased
   after these high-severity fires, and often attained densities much
   greater than those reconstructed for Southwestern ponderosa pine
   forests.
   Main conclusions Exclusion of fire has not clearly and uniformly
   increased fuels or shifted the fire type from low- to high-severity
   fires. However, logging and livestock grazing have increased tree
   densities and risk of high-severity fires in some areas. Restoration is
   likely to be most effective which seeks to (1) restore variability of
   fire, (2) reverse changes brought about by livestock grazing and
   logging, and (3) modify these land uses so that degradation is not
   repeated.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Does grazing have the same effect on plant species richness
   at different spatial scales? Does the effect of spatial scale vary under
   different climatic conditions and vegetation types? Does the slope of
   the species-area curve change with grazing intensity similarly under
   different climatic conditions and vegetation types?
   Location: Pastures along a climatic gradient in northeastern Spain.
   Methods: In zones under different regimes of sheep grazing (high-,
   low-pressure, abandonment), plant species richness was measured in
   different plot sizes (from 0.01 to 100 m(2)) and the slope of the
   species-area curves was calculated. The study was replicated in five
   different locations along a climatic gradient from lowland semi-arid
   rangelands to upland moist grasslands.
   Results: Species richness tended to increase with grazing intensity at
   all spatial scales in the moist upland locations. On the contrary, in
   the most and locations, richness tended to decrease, or remain
   unchanged, with grazing due to increased bare soil. Grazing
   differentially affected the slope (z) of the species-area curve (power
   function S = c A(z)) in different climatic conditions: z tended to
   increase with grazing in arid areas and decrease in moist-upland ones.
   beta-diversity followed similar pattern as z.
   Conclusions: Results confirm that the impact of grazing on plant species
   richness are spatial-scale dependent. However, the effects on the
   species-area relationship vary under different climatic conditions. This
   offers a novel insight on the patterns behind the different effects of
   grazing on diversity in moist vs. and conditions reported in the
   literature. It is argued that the effect of spatial scale varies because
   of the different interaction between grazing and the intrinsic spatial
   structure of the vegetation. Variations in species-area curves with
   grazing along moisture gradients suggest also a different balance of
   spatial components of diversity (i.e. alpha- and beta-diversity).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Treeless meadows and parks are widespread but poorly
   understood features of the montane vegetation of the western USA. These
   communities frequently form reversed treelines where grassy valleys
   occur below forested slopes above. Our purpose was to assess the
   environmental correlates of such treelines, as well as patterns in the
   composition and diversity of grasslands and forest margins in the Valles
   Caldera National Preserve.
   Location: Valles Caldera National Preserve (35 degrees 50'-36 degrees
   00' N, 106 degrees 24'-106 degrees 37' W, 2175-3150 m), Jemez Mountains,
   New Mexico, USA.
   Methods: We conducted a gradient analysis based on 200 nested quadrats
   on transects crossing reversed treelines and spanning the compositional
   heterogeneity of grasslands. We used cluster analysis and non-metric
   multidimensional scaling to assess relationships between compositional
   variation and environmental variables.
   Results: We found strong, highly significant relationships of the
   vegetation to gradients in slope inclination, soil texture, moisture,
   nutrient availability, and nighttime minimum temperatures. Reversed
   treelines are most strongly associated with shifts in the thermal
   regime, exhibit weaker relationships with soil texture and nutrient
   content, and show no relationship with gravimetric soil moisture.
   Gradients in aspect, soil moisture, and annual mean temperature are
   associated with compositional variation within grasslands and forest
   margins.
   Conclusions: Lower nightly minimum temperatures and fewer consecutive
   frost-free days resulting from cold-air drainage may prevent tree
   seedling establishment in valley bottoms via photo-inhibition, tissue
   damage, or frost heaving. Fine-textured soils may also impede tree
   seedling establishment in valley bottoms. These findings lay the
   groundwork for experimental and physiological tests of these potential
   causes of these reversed treelines.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed understanding of landscape changes along the urban-rural
   gradient provides a useful tool to compare the structural and functional
   differences of landscape patches at different orientations. Although
   several case studies have been conducted confirming the efficacy of this
   approach, integrating temporal data with gradient analysis is still
   rarely used in practice. In this study, a combination of remote sensing
   images, landscape metrics and gradient analysis are employed to analyze
   and compare both the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban sprawl in
   Guangzhou, China. The results show that landscape change in Guangzhou
   exhibits distinctive spatial differences from the urban center to rural
   areas, with higher fragmentation at urban fringes or in new urbanizing
   areas. Due to the complexity of top-down constraints and local
   interactions, Guangzhou exhibits a more complex, dynamic,
   multidimensional configuration of urban sprawl that is different from
   other cities in China. Urban area expanded towards the north and south
   areas due to the increased population and rapid economic development.
   Property market forces and government policy led to the rapid growth
   towards the southern areas. The study also confirms the hypothesis of
   diffusion-coalescence urban dynamics model in the process of
   urbanization. It demonstrates that in order to reveal the complexity of
   landscape pattern, temporal data are needed to capture the baseline as
   well as the spatio-temporal dynamics of landscape changes along the

   characterize the complex spatial pattern of urbanization in Guangzhou

Volume = {{200}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{1-19}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Given the importance of knowledge of species distribution for
   conservation and climate change management, continuous and progressive
   evaluation of the statistical models predicting species distributions is
   necessary Current models are evaluated in terms of ecological theory
   used, the data model accepted and the statistical methods applied. Focus
   is restricted to Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Generalised
   Additive Models (GAM). Certain currently unused regression methods are
   reviewed for their possible application to species modelling.
   A review of recent papers suggests that ecological theory is rarely
   explicitly considered. Current theory and results support species
   responses to environmental variables to be unimodal and often skewed
   though process-based theory is often lacking. Many studies fail to test
   for unimodal or skewed responses and straight-line relationships are
   often fitted without justification.
   Data resolution (size of sampling unit) determines the nature of the
   environmental niche models that can be fitted. A synthesis of differing
   ecophysiological ideas and the use of biophysical processes models could
   improve the selection of predictor variables. A better conceptual
   framework is needed for selecting variables.
   Comparison of statistical methods is difficult. Predictive success is
   insufficient and a test of ecological realism is also needed. Evaluation
   of methods needs artificial data, as there is no knowledge about the
   true relationships between variables for field data. However, use of
   artificial data is limited by lack of comprehensive theory.
   Three potentially new methods are reviewed. Quantile regression (QR) has
   potential and a strong theoretical justification in Liebig's law of the
   minimum. Structural equation modelling (SEM) has an appealing conceptual
   framework for testing causality but has problems with curvilinear
   relationships. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) intended to
   examine spatial non-stationarity of ecological processes requires
   further evaluation before being used.
   Synthesis and applications: explicit theory needs to be incorporated
   into species response models used in conservation. For example, testing
   for unimodal skewed responses should be a routine procedure. Clear
   statements of the ecological theory used, the nature of the data model
   and sufficient details of the statistical method are needed for current
   models to be evaluated. New statistical methods need to be evaluated for
   compatibility with ecological theory before use in applied ecology. Some
   recent work with artificial data suggests the combination of ecological
   knowledge and statistical skill is more important than the precise
   statistical method used. The potential exists for a synthesis of current
   species modelling approaches based on their differing ecological
   insights not their methodology. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by

Abstract = {{Characterizing ecosystem-atmosphere interactions in terms of carbon and
   water exchange on different time scales is considered a major challenge
   in terrestrial biogeochemical cycle research. The respective time series
   currently comprise an observation period of up to one decade. In this
   study, we explored whether the observation period is already sufficient
   to detect cross-relationships between the variables beyond the annual
   cycle, as they are expected from comparable studies in climatology.
   We investigated the potential of Singular System Analysis (SSA) to
   extract arbitrary kinds of oscillatory patterns. The method is
   completely data adaptive and performs an effective signal to noise
   separation.
   We found that most observations (Net Ecosystem Exchange, NEE, Gross
   Primary Productivity, GPP, Ecosystem Respiration, R-eco, Vapor Pressure
   Deficit, VPD, Latent Heat, LE, Sensible Heat, H, Wind Speed, u, and
   Precipitation, P) were influenced significantly by low-frequency
   components (interannual variability). Furthermore, we extracted a set of
   nontrivial relationships and found clear seasonal hysteresis effects
   except for the interrelation of NEE with Global Radiation (R-g).
   SSA provides a new tool for the investigation of these phenomena

Abstract = {{The genus Paramblynotus is the most species-rich genus of the so-called
   macrocynipoids, the large cynipoid parasitoids of wood-boring and
   cone-boring insect larvae. The species range in size from some of the
   largest to the smallest macrocynipoids, comparable in size to
   microcynipoids. Paramblynotus members occur on all continents except
   Europe and Australia, with most species being tropical or subtropical.
   The biology is poorly known but a few observations indicate that the
   species are parasitoids of beetle larvae. In this monographic revision

   qualitative and quantitative features of the external morphology.

   novel coding method, the method of Finite Mixture Coding (FMC) based on
   k-means clustering, or FMCK. The new method is similar to the FMC method
   proposed by previous authors in that they both generate codes (character
   states) for phylogenetic analysis as the direct output of a statistical
   procedure, thus avoiding the subdivision of quantitative data into
   discrete states on the basis of arbitrary criteria as with other coding
   methods. Through incorporating finite mixture analysis and likelihood
   estimation as used in FMC and k-mean cluster analysis for a priori
   statistical modeling of component distributions, FMCK is advantageous
   over FMC in that it can be implemented using readily available statistic
   programs with k-mean cluster analysis, such as STATISTICA, MINITAB or
   SYSTAT, available on both PC and Macintosh platforms. We were able to
   identify 8 quantitative characters among 23 as useful for cladistic
   analysis by using the new coding method. In total, our character matrix
   has 132 coded characters.
   The phylogenetic analysis indicates that species of the previously
   recognized genus Decelleu form a monophyletic group deeply nested within
   Paramblynotus. Decellea is therefore synonymized with Paramblynotus,
   which is separated into seven monophyletic species groups: the
   virginianus, scaber, ynngambicolars, nigricornis, apeosus, ruficollis,
   and punclulalus groups.
   Based on the phylogeny, we reconstruct the historical biogeography of
   the liopterid subfamily Mayrellinae, consisting of the genera
   Paramblynotus and Kiefferiellu, using dispersal-vicariance analysis in
   combination with palaeoenvironmental data. The results suggest that the
   subfamily originated in the Northern Hemisphere and then expanded its
   distribution early by way of the Bering area. The divergence between
   Puramblynotus and Kiefferiellu was apparently associated with the
   formation of the Rocky Mountains about 50 million years ago. An early
   Paramblynotus lineage dispersed to Africa from the eastern Palearctic by
   way of Arabia, and it subsequently diversified along with montane
   forests in Africa. The relatively high diversity of Paramblynotus in
   Southeast Asia is considered to be partly caused by the frequent sea
   level changes since late Oligocene (29 Ma), which drastically changed
   the land configuration of this area.
   We end this paper with a taxonomic revision of the genus Paramblynotus,
   with a total of 92 species treated, including 72 described as new and 20
   previously known, of which 18 are redescribed. Keys to the species
   groups as defined in this paper and to all known species of each species
   group are provided. For all species, the available information on their
   biology and distribution are summarized.}},

Abstract = {{Rivers are conduits for materials and energy; this, the frequent and
   intense disturbances that these systems experience, and their narrow,
   linear nature, create problems for conservation of biodiversity and
   ecosystem functioning in the face of increasing human influence. In most
   parts of the world, riparian zones are highly modified. Changes caused
   by alien plants - or environmental changes that facilitate shifts in
   dominance creating novel ecosystems - are often important agents of
   perturbation in these systems. Many restoration projects are underway.
   Objective frameworks based on an understanding of biogeographical
   processes at different spatial scales (reach, segment, catchment), the
   specific relationships between invasive plants and resilience and
   ecosystem functioning, and realistic endpoints are needed to guide
   sustainable restoration initiatives. This paper examines the
   biogeography and the determinants of composition and structure of
   riparian vegetation in temperate and subtropical regions and
   conceptualizes the components of resilience in these systems. We
   consider changes to structure and functioning caused by, or associated
   with, alien plant invasions, in particular those that lead to breached
   abiotic- or biotic thresholds. These pose challenges when formulating
   restoration programmes. Pervasive and escalating human-mediated changes
   to multiple factors and at a range of scales in riparian environments
   demand innovative and pragmatic approaches to restoration. The
   application of a new framework accommodating such complexity is
   demonstrated with reference to a hypothetical riparian ecosystem under
   three scenarios: (1) system unaffected by invasive plants; (2) system
   initially uninvaded, but with flood-generated incursion of alien plants
   and escalating invasion-driven alteration; and (3) system affected by
   both invasions and engineering interventions. The scheme has been used
   to derive a decision-making framework for restoring riparian zones in
   South Africa and could guide similar initiatives in other parts of the
   world.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of why introduced species achieve ecological success in
   novel environments often requires information about the factors that
   limit the abundance of these taxa in their native ranges. Although
   numerous recent studies have evaluated the importance of natural enemies
   in this context, relatively few have examined how ecological success may
   result from differences in the magnitude of interference competition
   between communities in the native and introduced ranges of nonnative
   species. Here we examine how native-range competitive environments may
   relate to invasion success for two important invasive species, the red
   imported. re ant ( Solenopsis invicta) and the Argentine ant (
   Linepithema humile), in a region of native-range sympatry. At two study
   sites in northern Argentina, we used stable-isotope analysis, a variety
   of observational approaches, and two different reciprocal removal
   experiments to test ( 1) whether S. invicta competes asymmetrically with
   L. humile ( as suggested by the 20th century pattern of replacement in
   the southeastern United States) and ( 2) the extent to which these two
   species achieve behavioral and numerical dominance. Stable-isotope
   analysis and activity surveys indicated that S. invicta and L. humile
   are both omnivores and forage during broadly overlapping portions of the
   diel cycle. Short-term removal experiments at baits revealed no
   competitive asymmetry between S. invicta and L. humile. Longer-term
   colony removal experiments illustrated that S. invicta and L. humile
   experience an approximately equal competitive release upon removal of
   the other. Our results indicate that neither S. invicta nor L. humile
   achieves the same degree of behavioral or ecological dominance where
   they co-occur in native populations as they do in areas where either is
   common in their introduced range. These results strongly suggest that
   interspecific competition is an important limiting factor for both S.
   invicta and L. humile in South America.}},

Abstract = {{Tourism activities can generate both positive and negative effects on
   the conditions of the areas where visiting and fruition activities take
   place; every form of human use of natural environment causes changes to
   the environment conditions. Evaluation of carrying capacity of a
   destination has as a purpose the measurement of the threshold over which
   alteration due to human activities becomes unacceptable. To evaluate the
   consequences of tourism activities impacts it is necessary to know the
   characteristics of the environment where they occur and especially its
   resilience, which is the measure of the disturbance that the natural
   environment can tolerate without altering its equilibrium state. The
   carrying capacity concept is linked with resilience and rises from the
   necessity of measure which is the maximum acceptable level of impact for
   the environment or for one of its components and the capability of
   recovery of the previous condition. The purpose of this study is to
   suggest a model for assessing the physical carrying capacity of tourism
   destinations, as a tool to evaluate whether the current situation is
   sustainable or not and to determine if a rise in visitor numbers could
   affect the quality of the environment, the resources available and the
   quality of public services. For the assessment, all environmental
   aspects are separately analysed and the main environmental issues
   related to the daily life of residents and to tourism activities (air
   quality, water quality and disposability, waste management, soil use)
   are considered. The methodology is based on an evaluative procedure
   inspired by the DPSIR model, useful for underlining which are the
   drivers of impacts and which is the most relevant dataset to describe
   current and future scenarios. The innovative aspect of this study is the
   integration of the physical carrying capacity assessment with the
   evaluation of the managing capacity of environmental and public
   services, which can lead to depletion of ecosystem quality.}},

Pages = {{109-119}},
Abstract = {{In the 1980s the Nature Conservancy Council created an ancient woodland
   inventory showing all woods in Great Britain (GB) greater than 2 ha that
   were believed to have had woodland habitat cover continuously from 1600.
   Subsequently these lists have been maintained as three separate
   inventories by NCC's successors, English Nature (now Natural England),
   Countryside Council. for Wales and Scottish Natural. Heritage. This
   paper outlines the concept of ancient woodland as it has developed in
   GB, and how this idea gave rise to the ancient woodland inventories. The
   criteria used in compiling the inventories are discussed, including the
   inception dates and the threshold size, and the difference between
   ancient woodland and parkland. The inventories have been digitised for
   use with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which has made them more
   accessible to planners and nature conservation bodies; however, the
   digitising process is more precise than the original definition of the
   boundaries of the ancient woodland. The three different countries have
   approached this issue slightly differently, taking account of the
   differing landscapes within which their ancient woodland exists. As the
   inventory developed, new Legislation has also been brought into play to
   protect ancient woodland further. The inventory currently lacks detailed
   information concerning the condition or type of wood, beyond its
   semi-natural or plantation status. Ascertaining, and then maintaining,
   the condition of ancient woodland in Great Britain wilt be a major

Abstract = {{Changes in mammal faunal complexes over time have often been considered
   the result of bioevents linked to major climatic changes though some
   authors claimed that environmental factors such as impacts, eruptions,
   and climatic change have a minimal effect, and intrinsic biotic controls
   may be essential in affecting taxonomic diversity and changing community
   structure. To contribute to the debate, Italian faunal complexes (FCs)
   have been analysed in order to correlate diversity trends and structural
   dynamics with the extensive Middle Pliocene to Late Pleistocene
   environmental changes. Three main aspects have been considered for
   exploring the palacoclimatic significance of faunal evolutionary
   changes: shifts in diversity; shifts in origination/immigration and
   extinction rates (turnover, dispersal, extinction phases); shifts in
   relative abundance of ecological categories defined herein.
   Two major structural reconstructions occurred in the FCs at the
   early/middle Villafranchian transition (from the Middle to the Late
   Pliocene, around 2.6 Ma) and from the early to middle Galerian (from the
   Early to the Middle Pleistocene, i.e., from about 1.2 to 0.7 Ma). The
   Villafranchian turnover phase corresponds to the Middle Pliocene climate
   deterioration, and can be considered a starting point for the Late
   Pliocene dispersal phases. The Early to Middle Pleistocene turnover
   represents the major reorganisation (dispersal and successive turnover)
   in the large mammal complexes of the Italian peninsula, and occurred in
   successive phases during the period of palaeoenvironmental changes at
   the onset of 100 ka climate cyclicity. Accordingly, the results of this
   study confirm that the most important renewals in the Italian large
   mammalian faunas (due both to origmations/immigrations and extinctions)
   are connected to major global climatic changes. Nonetheless, there is no
   or minor evidence of cyclical, climatically-driven turnovers matching
   ``glacial/interglacial{''} alternations. The late Villafranchian (latest
   Pliocene and Early Pleistocene partim) and middle/late Galerian FCs
   (early Middle Pleistocene), for instance, present only minor phyletic
   adjustments and their evolutionary patterns support a model of
   protracted minor faunal change which seems driven by more complex
   forcing factors rather than climate alone. All in all, patterns of
   Italian faunal complexes indicate that climatic changes act in driving
   faunal structural changes in a rather complex way and intrinsic biotic
   controls may also be essential in determining faunal complex evolution:
   major climate change (changes of climate cyclicity), via migrations and
   dispersal events, allowed diversity to increase and altered
   palaeocommunity equilibria, leading to new intra- and inter-guild
   dynamics. The new internal competition caused the disappearances of some
   species through time and led to a new equilibrium within reconstructed
   FCs.
   The results obtained indicate that, at least in Italy, climatic changes
   are a forcing factor, especially in large mammal first appearances,
   whereas the global reconstruction of the structure of the FCs has been
   also influenced by the internal dynamics, not necessarily predicting
   strict dependence on major climatic changes.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2007}},

Abstract = {{To understand the magnitude and ecological impact of predation, we need
   to know not only predator abundance and feeding rates, but also the area
   from which the prey are taken. Previous work on amphibious sea snakes
   (sea kraits Laticauda spp.) in New Caledonia has documented the former
   parameters, and suggested that these marine snakes may be major
   predators within coral-reef ecosystems. To estimate the area over which
   these snakes forage, we have developed methods based on detailed
   assessments of (1) the eel species consumed (and, hence, their habitats
   of origin), (2) the state of digestion (and, hence, time since capture)
   of prey items inside snakes returning to their home islands after
   foraging trips, and (3) the rate of digestion of prey in experimental
   trials. In combination with data on rates of snake movement, we conclude
   that one species (Laticauda laticaudata) forages mostly on soft-bottom
   habitats within 23 km of the home island, whereas the other species (L.
   saintgironsi) forages on coral substrates within 38 km of the home
   island. The distribution of estimated foraging ranges was similar
   between these 2 species (about one-third of prey taken within a few
   kilometres of the home island; the rest from a wide range of much
   further sites), despite interspecific divergence in traits such as prey
   types, prey sizes and rates of digestion. These extensive foraging
   ranges suggest that sea kraits are significant predators of eels over
   the entire area of the lagoon; and imply that populations of these top
   predators can be affected by disturbance to prey resources even many
   kilometres from the home island.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the behavioural changes of Indo-Pacific bottlenose
   dolphins Tursiops aduncus in response to boat-based tourism at both
   group and individual levels. The behaviour, movement and dive patterns
   of nursing females off the south coast of Zanzibar were investigated
   between January and March 2000 to 2002 and statistical comparisons were
   made between observations made at different levels of tourist activity.
   Behavioural data was collected during boat surveys using scan sampling
   of groups and focal individual follows of 5 female dolphins with calves.
   The movement patterns of dolphin groups were not affected by the
   presence of a few (1 to 2) tourist boats without swimmers. However, the
   groups displayed a significantly larger proportion of erratic
   (non-directional) movements as tourist activities increased and when
   swimmers were present. The proportion of active, peduncle, tail-out and
   porpoise dives also increased as tourist activity increased. Further,
   females travelled more frequently as tourist activities increased; this
   may have a negative effect on the time available for females to nurse
   their calves. Intense non-regulated dolphin tourism in this area may
   lead to a shift in habitat use by nursing females, and the apparent
   changes in dolphin behaviour due to the increased levels of tourism may
   ultimately reduce fitness at both individual and population levels. We
   urge that the guidelines already issued by the Department of Fisheries
   and Marine Products, Zanzibar, be implemented and complied with as a
   first important step towards sustainable dolphin tourism.}},

Abstract = {{Crop \& Food Research has developed a set of simulation-based Crop
   Calculators as precision management tools for optimising nitrogen (N)
   and water management of wheat, potato and maize crops. Their main
   purpose is to provide best practice N-fertiliser and irrigation
   management schedules for user-specified crops, or to predict the likely
   consequences of management decisions. Both economic returns and
   environmental impact (N-leaching) are taken into account. The
   Calculators have also been very useful in identifying production
   constraints. In some cases these have been able to be overcome, or in
   others inputs have been reduced to avoid environmental impacts and
   unnecessary costs. They provide a rapid method for assessing the effects
   of changes in management on production, soil resources and
   profitability.
   The Calculators are based on daily time-step simulation models. Each
   Calculator has a unique crop model simulating plant growth and
   development, with responses to variable water and N conditions, but all
   interact with a common soil model. The system model has CROP, SOIL,
   WEATHER and MANAGEMENT modules (Figure 1). During each daily time-step,
   CROP grows to a new state according to current soil state, weather and
   management conditions; and SOIL changes to a new state according to
   current crop state, weather and management conditions. MANAGEMENT has
   details of irrigation and N fertiliser application schedules, which may
   be specified by users to affect soil conditions in one way, or be
   generated by the system according to soil state and management rules to
   advise user for decision support in another way.
   Plant growth potential and the effects of water and N limitations were
   simulated. The levels of drought and N-deficit were quantified by
   simulating the changes in plant available water (balance between
   rainfall and irrigation versus evapotranspiration and drainage) and
   mineral N (balance of organic N mineralisation and N fertilisation
   versus plant N uptake, N leaching and emission) in soil profiles. Crop N
   demand was calculated as the sum of the N demand for various plant
   tissue categories. Crop N uptake was driven by the demand, but limited
   by soil mineral N availability. Effects of drought and N-deficit on crop
   growth were quantified by reducing leaf area expansion, accelerating
   leaf senescence, and reducing radiation use efficiency.
   The Calculators were validated against field-grown crops. Their
   prediction on crop growth and yield matched measurements from the crops
   well under various irrigation and N fertiliser applications and across a
   wide range of weather and soil conditions. Their effectiveness as
   management tools was demonstrated through significant reductions in
   fertiliser applications without reducing yield, especially for potato
   and maize.
   The features of the systems include: keeping it simple; appropriate
   compromise between accuracy and convenience; the use of real system
   constraints together with simulation results for suggesting management.

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study is to predict how much tree shade
   reduces heat stress in dairy cows using two published models which
   predict when heat stress will occur in dairy cows. The reduced solar
   radiation incident on a dairy cow in shaded conditions compared with the
   open should result in the models predicting a lower level of heat stress
   for that cow.
   Method: The two models used to predict heat stress in this study are the
   ECCLIPS model (Turnpenny et al. 2000a, 2000b) and the Heat Load Index or
   HLI (Gaughan and Castaneda 2003). The ECCLIPS model developed by John
   Turnpenny and colleagues calculates the thermal balance for a dairy cow
   under specified climate and radiation conditions. The HLI calculates a
   single index value based on empirical weightings of input variables (air
   temperature, humidity, black globe temperature and wind speed) and
   predicts thermal stress will occur once a threshold value of the index
   (74) is exceeded.
   Predicted heat stress in dairy cows was calculated using both models for
   a one week period in February 2005, at the Lincoln University Dairy
   Farm, Canterbury, New Zealand. Hourly mean climate and radiation data
   from `daylight' hours (0800-1900 hrs, n=84) were input into ECCLIPS and
   HLI. The same data were then re-input, but with solar radiation levels
   reduced to `Shade' conditions based on data from a study of tree-pasture
   interactions in the lower North Island (Douglas et al. 2006). The levels
   of cow thermal stress predicted by the heat stress models were compared
   for `Open' and `Shade' scenarios. If tree shade was effective in
   reducing cow heat stress, the models would predict a lower frequency of
   severe heat stress for the `Shade' scenario compared with the `Open'
   scenario.
   Results: For both models, the predicted frequency of severe heat stress
   in the open was dramatically reduced under shade. ECCLIPS predicted that
   four hours severe heat stress in the open reduced under shade to zero
   hours of severe heat stress; and 44 hours of significant heat stress in
   the open reduced to 5 hours of significant heat stress in the shade.
   HLI and ECCLIPS differed in the number of hours of predicted severe heat
   stress; for cows in the open, ECCLIPS only predicted four hours in the
   severe heat stress category, whereas HLI predicted 13 hours in the `Hot'
   and `Very Hot' categories (HLI>74).
   Conclusions: Tree shade completely eliminated any occurrences of severe
   heat stress, whether predicted by ECCLIPS or the HLI. This result
   suggests that Friesian cows will benefit from shade even under
   relatively mild summer conditions in coastal Canterbury.
   HLI and ECCLIPS differed in the number of hours of predicted severe heat
   stress. However, the thresholds for severe heat stress in these two
   models are set using different criteria. ECCLIPS predicts severe heat
   stress when the cow's evaporative cooling from sweat reaches its maximum
   possible value, and the cow must begin panting in order to maintain
   thermoneutrality. In contrast, the HLI threshold of 74 was set on the
   basis of various indicators of stress in dairy cows, e.g. reduced milk
   production, reduced feed intake or unusual levels of hormones in blood
   serum (Gaughan and Castaneda 2003).
   Heat balance models or thermal stress indices like HLI can be used to
   investigate shade benefits elsewhere in New Zealand, provided a complete
   set of hourly climate data are available.
   Comparison of ECCLIPS and HLI model predictions with field measurements
   of cow heat stress is needed to confirm reliability of these models
   under New Zealand conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The climate change information required for many impact studies is of a
   spatial scale much finer than that provided by climate models. For
   impact applications point specific climate projections are required.
   Therefore a gap exists between what climate models can predict about
   future climate change and the information relevant to our daily life.
   Statistical downscaling models are commonly used to fill this gap.
   Statistical downscaling models are based on the view that the regional
   climate is conditioned by two factors: the large scale climatic state,
   and local physiographic features. The analogue approach developed in the
   Bureau of Meteorology is one example of a more general type of
   statistical downscaling method based on weather classification methods
   in which predictands are chosen by matching previous (i.e., analogous)
   situations to the current weather-state.
   Individual statistical downscaling models were optimised for six regions
   covering the southern half of the Australian continent (five on the
   mainland and one for Tasmania) and for the four calendar seasons. Three
   surface predictands for which high quality climatic records are
   available were modelled: T-max, T-min and rainfall. Each individual
   model was optimised in two steps: first the best combination of
   large-scale atmospheric predictors was determined and then three
   additional parameters were tuned. The development and validation of the
   models was done using the NCEP/NCAR reanalyses from 1958 to 2003. Once
   all parameters were chosen and optimized, the statistical downscaling
   models were applied to a selection of global climate models which
   contributed to the 4(th) assessment made by the Intergovernmental Panel
   on Climate Change (IPCC) released in 2007. Up to 23 GCMs contributed to
   the assembled dataset, however as the statistical models rely on daily
   outputs for the predictors, only a subset of 11 models could be used.
   The experiments available include a simulation of the 20(th) century
   with external forcings and projections for the 21(st) century under two
   emissions scenarios: the A2 scenario (one of the highest emission
   scenario available) and the B1 scenario (one of the lowest emission
   scenarios available). In all cases time slices of either 40 years (at
   the end of the 20(th) century) or 20 years at the middle or the end of
   the 21(st) century are available.
   A graphical user-friendly interface has been developed to facilitate
   dissemination of the statistical downscaling model results. The
   graphical user-friendly interface covers the southern half of the
   Australian continent, and provides a range of options for users to
   obtain tailored information. The user may choose the emission scenario,
   the global climate models (one or several), the season, the region and
   the type of predictands. Once these choices are made, all available
   stations are displayed and the user can choose to display graphical
   outputs or download ASCII files containing the data. Point-specific
   future projections are available for the locations included in the
   high-quality climate data network, maintained by the National Climate
   Centre of the Bureau of Meteorology. This network forms the basis of our
   current understanding of the Australian climate.
   This new tool will enable users to access tailored climate change
   projections for their particular application and to investigate a range
   of uncertainties: emission scenario, climate model sensitivity,
   inter-annual variability and the spatial heterogeneity. The tool is
   currently only available internally within the Bureau of Meteorology but
   is expected to be made available to the public in 2008.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of this research is justified to the integration of
   landscape components for hydrological modelling within distributed
   models. Distributed models are based on homogeneous entities which are
   delineated using landscape parameters such as topography, land use,
   soil, and geology. In ungauged basins most of these required data are
   only available on a coarse spatial resolution. In order to by-pass this
   gap the globally and freely available data from the Shuttle Radar
   Topography Mission (SRTM) were used to obtain model entities on an
   adequate resolution of 30m and 90m. The research relates to two research
   hypotheses that focus on the integration of landscape components in
   hydrological modelling for the application in the program Prediction of
   Ungauged Basins (PUB) of the International Association of Hydrological
   Sciences (IAHS). The method relies on the assumption of a strong,
   process-driven feedback between the topography and further landscape
   components as well as runoff dynamics which can be quantified using
   geoinformation techniques. It is expected that the water balance of
   catchments with insufficient hydrometric infrastructure and data
   availability can be estimated using SRTM-based delineations of
   process-oriented model entities. Entities represent response units (RU)
   which were implemented in distributive hydrological models.
   Overall goal was to investigate the potential of SRTM-data for
   delineation of process relevant response units over various scales. An
   optimisation of the elevation data was therefore required to improve the
   SRTM-relief for hydrological applications. Improvements are necessary to
   embrace drawbacks in the interferometric radar data. Those effects
   result from geometric and radiometric errors as well as interaction
   properties of electro-magnetic waves with the surface. Resulting
   limitations in the SRTM-data could be diminished using several GIS
   procedures and new algorithms for void filling, vegetation reduction,
   hydrological oriented filter combinations and stream burning. Amongst
   others preparations a new developed sink fill method was implemented
   with the name LaSA (Landscape based Sink Algorithm). Main problems were
   vegetation offsets and narrow valleys that caused embarrassments at
   InSAR-DEMs in terms of `digital dams' and hydrological sinks. Standard
   algorithm to fill sinks can cause strong variations of the
   DEM-topography. The objective of LaSA is a minimisation of the
   interferences in DEM surfaces. Elimination of sinks should be realized
   by a landscape-based optimum between filling sinks and carving of flow
   paths in flow barriers.
   In result of the DEM-preparation, hydrological corrected SRTM data were
   available to establish a ruled-based framework for RU-delineation.
   Numerous topographic indices were applied on these data whereas the
   index selection was oriented on different relief driven processes.
   Taking into account the scale problem several indices such as
   Topographic Wetness Index, Stream Power Index were investigated in three
   subcatchments of the river Saale (Germany) with different landscape
   characteristics and thresholds for their classification were determined.
   The resulting datasets were analysed by the Cluster Analysis IVHG. This
   approach combines areas with small displacements in the multivariate
   space only under the constraint of an immediate neighbourhood. Under
   consideration of method transferability and scale a landscape dependent
   roughness index was integrated into data preparation. That led to a
   balanced representation of different landscape types. In order to
   determine the best level of generalisation significant changes of
   distance vectors were analysed. Finally, different patterns of process
   driven RU combining various topographic indices were delineated for the
   three mesoscale-catchments within different landscape types. These
   RU-sets were used as input entities in the hydrological model J2000. The
   analysis of significance of the different landscape components to
   estimate runoff dynamics will define the potential of this approach for
   the use in ungauged basins.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are the digital representation of
   natural topographic as well as man-made features located on the surface
   of the earth. For the last few decades, DEMs are widely used for
   resource management, urban planning, transportation planning, earth
   sciences, environmental assessments, and Geographic Information System
   (GIS) applications. The hydrologic community is also moving into a new
   era of using GIS technology (with the DEM of the area of interest being
   the primary and necessary input) in spatially explicit eco-hydrological,
   biophysical, hydrodynamic and hydraulic modelling approaches to answer
   critical on-ground questions such as choosing appropriate areas within
   catchments to implement different landuse changes and land management
   options. Almost all of the applications including water resource
   management and hydrological modelling require high resolution DEMs
   because the accuracy of DEMs significantly affects the accuracy of
   hydrological predictions.
   High resolution DEMs are not available across most of Australia and
   around the world. Improvements in gathering and displaying elevation
   data make it economically feasible to address the chronic lack of
   high-resolution terrain data. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), a
   relatively new technology, offers advantages over traditional methods
   for representing a terrain surface. The advantages refer to accuracy,
   resolution, and cost. One of the most attractive characteristics of
   LiDAR is its very high vertical accuracy, which enables it to represent
   the Earth surface with high accuracy.
   The NSW Department of Water and Energy (DWE) and NSW Department of
   Environment and Climate Change (DECC) along with Murray Darling Basin
   Commission and Department of Commerce is undertaking the Hydraulic
   Modelling of the flood inundation patterns and overland flow in the
   Koondrook-Perricoota Forest (KPF). MIKE FLOOD with bathymetry derived
   from 1m LiDAR DEM is used to reproduce the observed inundation patterns
   for historical flood events (model calibration/validation) and to
   predict the inundation patterns (areas, depths and flow velocities)
   across the KPF under the proposed new inflow regime.
   This paper presents the results from a statistical analysis undertaken
   to investigate the accuracy of the 1m LiDAR DEM by comparing the LiDAR
   elevations at more than 12000 points (in steep as well as flat areas)
   with on-ground field survey elevations. The field survey points used to
   quantify the accuracy of the LiDAR data have a vertical accuracy of 1mm.
   The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Percentile values from the
   statistical analysis indicate that the 1m LiDAR DEM is a reasonably good
   representation of the ground elevations for any detailed hydraulic and
   hydrological modelling exercise.}},

Abstract = {{The E2 catchment modelling software (Figure 1) was initially developed
   in concept and application over 2003/04 and released in 2005. Its design
   and construction drew on many previous examples and experiences with
   catchment modelling systems, in addition to a set of new needs for a
   science delivery system, and many years of experience in conceptualising
   and modelling catchment processes. The system combines the abstract
   concepts of generation, delivery and filtering of flow and constituents
   with a flexible spatial discretisation system and the ability to
   accumulate, move and manage fluxes through complex networks.
   Since the first public release, E2 has gained acceptance in areas of
   Australia as a flexible modelling tool. Some of the advantages of E2
   have been the flexibility of choice of methods for almost all facets of
   the catchment modelling process, the capacity to build and plug-in new
   models if those available are not appropriate, and the capacity to add
   extra functionality through external plug-ins.
   The user community for E2 has been very supportive, providing feedback
   on design and operational issues, and supporting information exchange on
   applications. The developers have also contributed significantly,
   managing an ever-increasing set of new features requests, handling bugs
   created by software platform changes and the idiosyncrasies of a new and
   extremely flexible modelling system. The underlying system for E2 has
   now developed to the point where it will serve as the basis for a
   broader set of environmental modelling and research tools.
   The features provided in E2 have expanded steadily since the first
   release, both due to the longer time for development of these, as well
   as the enlargement of the needs of users, and extension of application
   of E2 to a broader set of problem situations. The current version (V
   1.3.2) has been downloaded some 450 times, and is supported by an email
   user groups with approximately 70 members.
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   In its 3-year life E2 has been applied to a broad range of catchment
   modelling problems, including decision support for water quality
   improvement, nutrient fate and transport modelling for algal bloom
   prediction, estimation of nutrient loads from dairy systems, assessment
   of the impacts of runoff from bushfire affected forests, and
   investigation of development options and sewage treatment in urban
   growth areas.
   Current E2 development is separating the underlying `engine' from the E2
   modelling application. The engine provides a robust architecture (i.e.
   component-based river system modelling with functional units, node and
   loss models, flows, filtering and constituents) for basic catchment
   modelling needs, and is being developed to meet further needs. This
   expanded engine will be used in future to provide the basis for a suite
   of modelling tools for specific uses, such as river management or
   restoration.
   The inheritor to the E2 catchment modelling software tool, built upon
   this base, is WaterCAST, which was developed to provide not only the
   features available in the current E2 system, but also access to enhanced
   features that include stochastic data inputs and more and better models
   representing catchment flow paths, fluxes and transformations.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies on the asymmetric and non-linear properties of US business
   cycles exclude the dimension of asymmetric conditional volatility. Engle
   (1982) proposes an autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH)
   model to capture the time-varying volatility of inflation rates in the
   United Kingdom. Weiss (1984) finds evidence of ARCH in the US industrial
   production. The ARCH model is then extended to generalized ARCH (GARCH)
   models by Bollerslev (1986) and exponential GARCH models by Nelson
   (1991). Recently Stock and Watson (2002) find that a substantial
   reduction in the variability of the US output growth since the early
   1980s can be explained by a reduction in the variance of macroeconomic
   shocks. However, a few researchers have attempted to formally model
   asymmetries in the conditional variance of business-cycle variables (see
   Brunner 1992, Hamori 2000, and Ho and Tsui 2001, 2003 and 2004). All
   these studies are confined to univariate GARCH analysis. One major
   drawback of the univariate GARCH framework is that it does not capture
   the co-movement of business-cycle variables, nor analyze the empirical
   evidence of asymmetric volatilities in the context of multivariate GARCH
   approach.
   In this paper, we use the multivariate GARCH framework to investigate
   the evidence of asymmetric volatility and time-varying conditional
   correlations between sectors of the monthly US industrial production
   (IIP) indices in 1961-1997. We propose three new multivariate asymmetric
   GARCH models, which are developed based on a synthesis and improvement
   of the methodologies of Ding et al (1993), Sentana (1995) and Tse and
   Tsui (2002), including the VC-Quadratic GARCH (VC-QGARCH) model,
   VC-Leveraged GARCH (VC-LGARCH) model, and VC-Threshold GARCH (VC-TGARCH)
   model. Our proposed models are computationally manageable and are
   capable of capturing features of volatility asymmetry and the path of
   time-varying correlations. The issues of conditional heteroskedasticity
   and volatility asymmetry of business cycles are important because of
   their implications on macroeconomic and business cycle theory,
   measurement and forecasting. If business cycles are conditionally
   heteroskedastic and exhibit volatility asymmetry, then any theory
   assuming the absence of either of these properties is most likely
   inadequate. It is crucial to understand the potential macroeconomic
   policy implications of asymmetric volatility shocks for economies. If
   negative shocks induce greater future volatilities on IIP than positive
   shocks of the same magnitude, this might further vindicate the
   implementation of macroeconomic stabilisation measures by the government
   in times of recession.
   We use monthly data from the OECD website SourceOECD: Main Economic
   Indicators for the 5 sectoral IIP of the US: the Consumer Good (CG), the
   Investment Good (IG), the Manufacturing (M), the Non-Durables (ND) and
   the Raw Materials (RM) with 444 observations.
   The results show that negative shocks have a greater impact on future
   volatilities than positive shocks of the same magnitude for the 5
   sectoral IIP series in the U. S. Most parameter estimates of the
   time-varying conditional correlation coefficient equation are
   significant at the 5\% level, indicating that dynamic correlations
   probably exist among the 5 main industrial groups/sectors. The estimates
   of the time-invariant component of the correlation coefficient equation,
   rho, are significantly positive and broadly similar to those estimates
   from the constant conditional correlations models, which is consistent
   with Lucas' (1977) observation More importantly, the pattern of
   conditional correlations and the magnitude of rho differ among the 10
   sectoral pairs, ranging from a low of 0.2763 (IG-ND pair) to 0.7652
   (M-RM pair) and 0.8363 (CG-M pair). This is consistent with results from
   the VC-LGARCH model. The findings on asymmetric effects have policy
   implications for government to consider the effective countercyclical
   measures during recessions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new test for structural instability among only
   some individuals at the end of a sample in a panel regression model.
   Most tests for structural breaks in the literature are appropriate when
   the break is relatively long lasting and happens in the middle of a
   sample. The distribution of the corresponding test statistic is suitably
   found using asymptotics in which the number of observations before and
   after the break point go to infinity. However, it is often at the end of
   a sample that researchers and policy-makers alike are interested in
   testing for instability.
   Andrews (2003) proposes a test for structural break which was shown to
   be particularly useful when the number of post-break observations is
   small. Unlike the well known Predictive Failure test of Chow (1960), the
   critical values of Andrews's (1993) test statistic are calculated using
   parametric sub-sampling methods making the test robust to non-normal,
   heteroskedastic and serially correlated errors. The extension of the
   test to panel data, under the assumption of cross sectional
   independence, is relatively straightforward as shown in Mancini-Griffoli
   and Pauwels (2006). This extension assumes an alternative hypothesis
   that all individuals exhibit a break, as in other tests for structural
   breaks in the panel literature. Yet, these tests do not allow the
   interesting alternative that only some and not all - individuals are
   affected by a break. This paper addresses such question by introducing a
   standardized Z statistic built from Andrews (2003) statistics averaged
   across individuals.
   Methodologically, the proposed procedure is similar to the approach in
   Im et al. (2003) which, while focussing on the different question of
   unit root tests, also considers an average of separate statistics. The
   test statistic is shown to follow a normal distribution as the number of
   individuals goes to infinity by using the Lindeberg-Feller Central Limit
   Theorem (LF-CLT). This greatly simplifies the computation of the
   critical values with respect to Andrews (2003). As in Andrews (2003),
   though, the proposed statistic is robust to non-normal, heteroskedastic,
   serially correlated errors and when the instability occurs at the end of
   a given sample. Lastly, the test covers the cases of parameter
   heterogeneity or homogeneity pre- and post-instability. Moreover, it is
   straightforward to extend the proposed test statistic and the associated
   asymptotic results to accommodate the presence of cross sectional
   dependency.
   A series of Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed structural
   break test performs very well in finite sample. The experiments
   accommodate serial correlation in the error terms with a mixture of
   different distributions for the innovations. Monte Carlo results
   indicate that the test has good size and power with relatively few time
   series and moderate serial correlation within cross sections. For high
   levels of serial correlation, the performance of the test improves as
   the number of time series observations, T, increases. Lastly, the test
   has good power and size for partial instabilities, when the
   instabilities are of a small magnitude.
   Finally, this paper considers an empirical application of the test to
   demonstrate its practical usefulness. The question of detecting the
   effects of Euro on trade has been at the center of lively debates in
   academic and policy circles alike. However, the papers that have tackled
   the issue have not provided strong empirical evidence in support of the
   presumed effect. This is largely due to two empirical issues: the few
   datapoints available after the Euro's introduction and the heterogeneity
   of the trade effect over different countries. Given both these
   characteristics, the test introduced in this paper is particularly well
   suited. Results show a break at the 10\% significance level in Eurozone
   trade starting in 1998, thereby supporting to the belief commonly
   expressed in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Farmland prices are a critical determinant of farm profitability. Yet
   around the world analyses of farm land prices rarely produces models
   which are both contextually and empirically robust. This paper examines
   the movement of land prices in both Denmark and New Zealand during the
   period 1981 to 2005.
   Typically, farm prices are modelled in terms of their fundamental
   economic values as reflected by discounted future earnings (net-present
   value type of models (NPV)). Hedonic modelling approaches are helpful in
   relating earnings potential to land characteristics but still leave
   significant variation unexplained. This paper takes an alternative
   approach which is, in part, motivated by the observation that
   significant areas of land in Finland are owned by non-farmers and this
   is also true in New Zealand, though to a lesser extent. Hence the paper
   explores the impact of the wider economic performance on stochastic
   trend in land values by examining the convergence between Gross Domestic
   Product (GDP), aggregated agricultural income (AAI) and farmland prices
   (FP). A number of regional policy issues are also related to heavily
   subsidised agriculture in Finland.
   Our approach is to convert data series into a stationary form and in
   this way ensure the necessary conditions for analysis. Results from unit
   root testing provide evidence that logs of average farmland price (FP),
   GDP and aggregated agricultural income (AAI) series are first difference
   stationary I(1) series. In the case of the New Zealand data, the ADF was
   capable of confirming the result. For the Finnish data, the Hadri test
   was done in level as well as in first differences. On first differences,
   the null of joint stationarity is accepted. This suggests that the
   Finnish data series of GDP, aggregated agricultural income and farmland
   prices are also first difference stationary. However the Hadri test
   gives mixed results of stationarity of New Zealand data at levels,
   suggesting that these series are joint stationary I(0). This result is
   not supported by other panel data joint stationary tests. Unit root
   tests clearly suggest that modelling must be done on first differences.
   Results do not support prediction of fast structural change in factors
   affecting Finnish farmland prices. However, they support the view that
   agricultural factors do not have a large effect on agricultural land
   prices in Finland. This might partially explain why hedonic land price
   models fail to give reasonable explanation power over variations in
   farmland prices. Models where value of the land is given by the
   capitalized value of current and expected future streams of net income
   from agriculture fail because, at least in the Finnish case, they
   capture only a limited part of stochastic variation in land prices.
   However, the situation is completely different within the New Zealand
   data. Here the results give a reasonable base for models relying on the
   present value approach, because a reasonable part of the stochastic
   variation in land prices is explained by agricultural factors affecting
   agricultural income.
   Results also support the idea that agriculture's influence on
   agricultural land prices is weakening. However, changes are not as
   dramatic as could be expected by agricultural product price statistics.
   These results show the importance of analysts extending their analyses
   to make better use of indicators of changes in the wider economy when
   seeking to explain fluctuation in agricultural land prices and in
   looking to anticipate future changes.}},

Abstract = {{Major initiatives in Europe, USA and Australia are developing data and
   modelling infrastructure to underpin research and decision support. When
   these are put in place, how will the currency of data and the easy
   integration of data and models change the way research is published and
   reports are developed? We propose an interactive journal, or i-journal,
   as a way of exploiting this information richness. Where reports are
   developed within the infrastructure, there is an opportunity to maintain
   the process of report generation along with the report. The paper
   explores benefits from the publisher's perspective, such as allowing new
   reports to be generated quickly, tailored reports for different
   audiences to be generated automatically and corporate memory to be
   maintained. It also covers benefits from the user's perspective, such
   as, the history of report data and models can be traced, the report
   regenerated with current up-to-date data, and the infrastructure can
   suggest alternative data and models to use for comparison.
   The i-journal is an interactive document that allows users to
   interrogate and explore the resources and modelling process used to
   generate reports. Available on-line, the i-journal enables users to
   select charts, look at the detailed values, follow a reference to the
   sources of the input charts and run the models interactively. Models can
   be examined and parameters changed. The users are thus able to explore
   reports initially generated and investigate other possibilities for
   their own understanding. This is both an opportunity for the author to
   show a coherent picture of connected models and data resources, with
   explanations as why particular parameters or modelling processes have
   been chosen, and for the recipient to use a coherent starting point to
   explore the wider data and modelling space.
   There are significant challenges in building an interoperability
   framework capable of supporting the i-journal. None of the frameworks
   are up to it yet, but we outline what is needed, including: semantic
   model and data integration, versioning, registries and provenance.
   With the ability to generate reports on-the-fly, the i-journal allows
   for customisation. By providing authoring tools for the i-journal,
   report publishers specify the data to be included and how they are
   related together. While the authoring tool aims at facilitating the task
   of pulling information together, reusing data in various situations,
   even previously authored content, it raises a number of issues such as
   deciding what needs to be automated and/or semi-automated and to what
   extent. It also raises the issue of what capabilities users are
   expecting from an authoring tool (e. g., content, presentation,
   modelling authoring), as the specialist systems for each are quite
   sophisticated.
   The i-journal concept provides a way to explore dynamic modelling in the
   context of a report. It provides interactive facilities using a
   reference scenario defined by the author but allows users to modify and
   examine variations to the base scenario. This approach gives users the
   opportunity to explore and better understand the problem space.}},

Abstract = {{Drainage schemes for agro-ecological salinity management have been set
   to lower the shallow groundwater to help increase production and reduce
   the ecological risk. Once the groundwater levels are lowered to desired
   agro-ecological thresholds then drainage scheme's operation needs to be
   optimised according to the groundwater dynamics both in terms of space
   and time to achieve hydro-economic efficiency. Every system, even the
   most complicated ones, can be modelled if its behaviour is fully known
   and understood but a key difficulty in optimization is dealing with
   non-linear spatio-temporal problems. Such problems can be optimised
   using genetic algorithm aimed at finding near optimal solutions to
   highly non-linear optimization problems. GAs are nature inspired
   stochastic computational techniques. The major advantages of these
   algorithms are their broad applicability, flexibility and their ability
   to find optimal or near optimal solutions with relatively modest
   computational requirements.
   This paper presents the development of a surface-groundwater interaction
   model for the spatiotemporal optimization of pumping operation of
   Subsurface Drainage Schemes to achieve the similar or better level of
   service both in space and time domains. A drainage scheme, Wakool
   Tullakool Subsurface Drainage Scheme (WTSSDS), from New South Wales is
   included as a case study to illustrate the need for the optimisation of
   drainage operation to achieve the hydro-economic efficiency. The model
   results are being used to plan an optimal operation of the tubewells to
   control water logging and salinisation.
   Once a groundwater pumping system is put in place to service the
   waterlogging and salinity problems in an irrigation area, changing
   temporal conditions (rainfall, flooding and irrigation practices)
   necessitate a dynamic management response. Such an approach needs to be
   based on a comprehensive understanding of the groundwater dynamics for
   achieving economic efficiency of drainage since some of the tubewells
   may become ineffective while others start drawing more water than
   required to keep the watertable at the desired levels.
   The optimal management strategy, as determined by the
   simulation-optimization analyses, suggests the same or even better
   pumping performance of the scheme could be achieved using 42 wells
   (rather than 53) and a maximum pumping rate of 1000 m(3) d(-1) for an
   individual pump. The groundwater pumping can be reduced by around 1 MCM
   yr(-1) which is approximately 20 \% lesser than the existing rate. This
   will lead to substantial cost savings by reducing the number of wells
   needed and less pumping. Preliminary cost estimates indicated that \$
   4000 MCM yr(-1) pumping cost could be saved.
   This study has also shown that a MODFLOW based surface-groundwater
   interaction model, using hydrogeology, soils, groundwater levels,
   groundwater pumping, channel network and net recharge information can be
   a useful tool to develop understanding of the groundwater dynamics. The
   simulation-optimization analyses can effectively be used to plan an
   optimal operation of the subsurface drainage scheme to control water
   logging and salinisation in a hydroeconomically viable way.}},

Abstract = {{Developing reliable methods for predicting advance of potentially
   harmful invaders in a novel environment remains a persistent challenge
   to epidemiological and ecological modelers. The dominating demographic
   approaches handle space only implicitly and the spatio-temporal
   variation in the resources for invaders growth, reproduction, and spread
   are widely missed.
   Here we introduce a geographic automata based spread model for Colorado
   Beetle that attempts to capture both the inter-seasonal variation in
   environment and the spread dynamics. Spread is modeled with active,
   wind-aided, and logistic-aided dispersals. With the model the resource
   base of the invader can be explored using the resource profiles of
   summers and winters, categorized by their temperature sums and regimes
   respectively. We use a case study of hypothetical aerial invasion of
   Colorado Beetle in Finland to demonstrate how the model can be used for
   exploration and prediction of invasion dynamics.
   The simulation model consists of a spatial seasonal resource array and
   of a spatial abundance level of beetles. During simulation several
   spatio-ecological metrics are updated. These metrics help the user to
   compare seasonal changes in location and area of invasion pattern,
   perforation rate of the pattern, and occurrence probabilities (OP) of
   the invading species. Occurrence probability gives an estimate of
   relative abundance of the invader in the situations where detailed
   individually based estimates are not feasible. Because an invader's
   impact is correlated with its abundance, a surrogate model is thereby
   generated by relating the invader's abundance to environmental variables
   and their inter-seasonal fluctuations. Hanski and Gilpin (1997; Hanski
   1999) are in the same line finding that efforts to explain and predict
   occurrence patterns on the basis of species-specific resource
   requirements may have a high probability of success.
   Such a model, like the one we introduce here, could elucidate which part
   of the potential habitat will be most prone to permanent establishment
   of an invader. Lack of precision should not be a deterrent to developing
   predictive models where none exists. Crude predictions can be refined as
   additional data become available. Even though the problems of a priori
   modeling, such as validation and verification, do arise, in many cases
   it is the only approach we can use in order to get at least a glimpse to
   the future.
   These future events can be explored, for instance, by studying the
   differences in location, area, and perforation rate of the invasion
   pattern and by comparing occurrence probabilities of the species in
   multiple spatial and temporal scales in selected area. The user is also
   able to explore directional speeds with emerging primary and secondary
   progression zones for a selected area. The metrics aid the user in
   exploring the evolution of an invasion pattern at different scales and
   compare the regional differences in spreading rates between selected
   areas.
   Consequently, the aim of this study is to enter the field of a priori
   modeling and develop GIS-based software for exploration of the resource
   base of potential invader and for simulation of its potential spread in
   Finland. In addition our objectives are firstly to identify and rank the
   most risk prone areas where resource for growth, dispersal, and
   overwintering are most favorable from season to season. These are the
   areas where establishment of the beetle is most likely to happen if a
   mass migration takes place and the eradication measures fail. Secondly,
   our objective is to develop a model with which the resource base of the
   invader under current and future climates can be explored using the
   resource profiles of different temperature-categorized summers and
   winters at several scales. Thirdly, our objective is to provide the user
   with the metrics which would aid their exploration of the evolution of
   an invasion pattern at different scales and to compare the regional
   differences in spreading rates between selected areas.}},

Abstract = {{Isolated trees and small patches of trees - paddock trees - are very
   common within the agricultural landscapes of Southern Australia. These
   paddock trees potentially represent important natural habitat elements
   within the agricultural matrix for a variety of fauna, in particular
   birds. However, the numbers of paddock trees are declining rapidly in
   many areas which threaten the biodiversity values of these landscapes.
   To study the importance of these trees for bird species richness
   (sampled in 120 sites), we mapped isolated trees and forest cover from
   Landsat7 and SPOT 5 images using a combination of the normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), spatial filtering and threshold
   values. The results of the isolated trees map were verified visually
   using measures of omission and commission based on a high resolution
   (2.5m) pseudo natural colour SPOT image on which individual trees could
   be clearly distinguished. A high level of accuracy (80\%-90\%) was
   achieved in deriving a layer of trees represented as point objects in
   areas with low-medium tree cover. The overall percent cover of isolated
   trees and forests as mapped from the combined map of isolated trees and
   the classified Landsat image explained 60\% of the variability of the
   foliage projective cover (FPC) as digitized from the high resolution
   (2.5m) SPOT images.
   Various discrete and continuous landscape metrics were calculated based
   on the tree and forest mapping. These included traditional landscape
   metrics available within Fragstats software, as well as continuous
   landscape metrics which were based on spatial filtering and distance
   from and within patches. The relevance of both types of metrics for bird
   richness was analysed according to functional groups of birds (woodland
   and non-woodland). Remotely sensed forest cover at spatial scales
   between 0.03 and 0.28 km(2) was found to explain almost 50\% of the
   variability in overall bird richness and 60\% of the variability in
   woodland bird richness. However, paddock trees and small patches of
   trees or forest did not contribute to the explanation of the spatial
   variability in overall avian richness. The work provides a novel
   approach to investigating the ecological relevance of small and isolated
   landscape features, such as paddock trees, for bird species richness.

Abstract = {{Square-grid digital elevation models (DEMs) are widely used to calculate
   in an accurate way different morphologic parameters from the DEM
   surface. The digital terrain analysis allows defining primary attributes
   such as slope, aspect, plan and profile curvature, local fractal
   dimension, and secondary attributes more devoted to estimate the role
   played by topography in the distribution of soil water or on the
   susceptibility of landscapes to erosion, for instance.
   High resolution DEMs can provide more precise results but require
   specific treatments related to the vertical accuracy. The present
   application concerns the study of different volcanic cinder cones of the
   Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt. Their evolution is directly related to
   erosion processes and partly to the human activity that develop on their
   flank gullies and local collapse structures.
   Volcanic cinder cones formed by cinder and pyroclastic debris are
   generally considered as truncated cones with a crater located in the
   summit. Morphologic changes occur with time and can provide information
   about the age of the edifice using quantitative ratio between different
   parameters in order to characterize the volcanic shape: i.e., the ratio
   height of the cone versus the base diameter would be equal to 0.18 and
   the ratio between the crater diameter and the base diameter would remain
   at 0.40. Until now, numerous geomorphological studies concerning the
   geomorphic definition of the volcanic characteristics or the effect of
   the erosion process are based on these parameters and ratio.
   In order to quantify the volume of removed material during the erosion
   process, an algorithm that reconstitutes the original volcanic shape has
   been applied in a first approach to a 5 m resolution DEM and new
   parameters characterizing the volcanic cones have been proposed.
   In the present case, a combination of aircraft-based LIDAR and GPS has
   been used to enhance in the same region the former DEM resolution in
   such a way that the treatments presented here have been applied to a 1 m
   resolution DEM.
   The process decomposes the studied zone in different altitude slices
   according to the hypsometric interval chosen; the corresponding contour
   line is then extracted. The convex zone of each slice is calculated in
   such a way that a volcanic cone without gullies can be created. The new
   position of the contour lines thus generated is taken into account to
   simulate the erosive regression inside the different actual gullies and
   calculate the volume of cinders removed during this process. For a given
   altitude, all the original DEM pixels that are equal or higher than this
   altitude are reported in an image and codified with the value 1000; on
   the contrary, all the convex DEM pixels that are lower than this
   altitude are codified with the value 500.
   This procedure manages a free space codified with the value 10000 and
   where the intermediate position of the contour line has to be
   researched. This calculation depends on a dilation procedure used to
   fill progressively the free space. The new position of the contour line
   corresponds to the limit between the two dilated zones. This procedure
   is applied until reaching the position of the contour lines as observed
   in the original DEM.
   The hypsometric difference between the original DEM and the successive
   reconstituted DEM provides an estimation of the volume of the eroded
   material at each step.
   Actually, the present treatment illustrates the increasing of the gully
   depth and does not take into account its progressive formation from the
   volcanic base line until its present position. For this reason, further
   developments will simulate progressively the gully formation according
   to the time scale provided by terrain observations.}},

Abstract = {{New Zealand has a long history of land-use change. In Canterbury, there
   has recently been a shift from irrigated cropping or dry land sheep
   production to dairy. The effects of this change in land use on the
   amount of nitrate being leached to groundwater are of particular
   concern. Assessment of the risks associated with any land use requires
   an accounting system that properly tracks the inputs, outputs,
   retentions and losses of water and nitrate over long periods of time,
   both in steady state and in transition. Farming systems are complex in
   terms of time and space necessitating validated models that take into
   account processes simulating the effects of major nutrient sources and
   sinks on appropriate time scales and that balance soil and plant
   processes.
   In this paper we describe how we moved from a single crop model that
   predicted production, leaching and drainage through the lifetime of a
   crop to a system that addresses the above requirements. The model we
   developed can be initiated at an arbitrary point in time, run for an
   arbitrary length of time through many seasons. It keeps track of the
   state of the soil, predicts production, leaching and drainages from
   arbitrary sequences of crops and pastures, and accounts for some returns
   from animals.
   The LUCI (Land Use Change and Intensification) Framework Model (LFM) has
   evolved from a suite of models that began with the Sirius Wheat Model
   (Jamieson et al. 1998, Jamieson and Semenov 2000). That model was
   designed to investigate the effects of variations in nitrogen and water
   on wheat production and quality. The first step in the process of
   evolving the LFR was to disentangle the soil, plant, evapotranspiration
   management and weather modules into distinct interacting objects.. This
   allowed a crop other than wheat to be substituted into the model. Such
   substitutions led to independent models for potato and maize.
   Simulations using these crop-specific models extend only over the
   lifetime of the crop, so that leaching was calculated only during that
   interval. However, the final water and N status of the soil was recorded
   at the end of the simulation.
   The latest version of LFM extends these individual models by providing a
   framework that maintains the state of the soil from a cropping event
   through the fallow period between cropping events to the next crop.
   The LFM operates from weather scenarios that exist for the period of
   investigation. It uses a soil percolation and leaching model based on
   the cascade model of Addiscott and Whitmore (1991). This model has been
   extended to include an organic nitrogen and carbon cycling day-step
   model derived from SOCRATES (Grace and Ladd, 1995) and CENTURY
   (Metherall et al 1993).
   Each crop rotation is controlled by a seasonal growth model that manages
   the interaction among the weather, soil and crop models, with
   management, such as fertilisation and irrigation, determined by
   appropriate rules.
   The LFM model may be run continuously for several years, switching among
   crops in rotation. Validating the component models is a continuing
   process - testing production, leaching and drainage estimates against
   field measurements (Zyskowski et al. 2007). Methods of aggregation
   account for local heterogeneity effects on leaching (Snow et al
   2007a,b).}},

Abstract = {{Although forest dynamics simulation methods based on gap dynamics have
   been in existence for more than 35 years since the JABOWA model (Botkin
   et al. 1972) was first published, few of these models have moved beyond
   research tools to a decision and policy formulation support role.
   These models simulate growth and succession of tree species under
   changing environmental conditions that include light, soil moisture,
   temperature and availability of nutrients. The models have been used to
   investigate forest succession, response of forested ecosystems to
   management related disturbances and possible effects of climate change
   (Botkin 1993, Kimmins 2003). However, there has not been widespread use
   of these valuable tools for decision making as would be hoped. It
   appears that much of the model use has been targeted to researchers more
   than decision makers. This has led to increasing complexity in most of
   these models to the extent that decision makers find them impractical in
   terms of operating skill, lack of flexibility, data requirement, and
   time commitment (Robinson and Freebairn, 2001).
   While forest dynamic models have contributed to the knowledge and
   understanding of forest succession, there is much to be gained through
   greater direct application of these models by decision makers to manage
   forests. Current work at Environmental Protection Agency, Queensland
   (EPA), suggests that forest dynamics models have capacity to contribute
   to: achievement of balanced approaches towards forest conservation and
   sustainable forest management; translation of available forest knowledge
   into a language suitable to stakeholders; understanding of adaptation of
   forests to climate change at a local scale; on-the-ground forest
   management practices by focusing on priority policy issues and
   enhancement of forest management through innovative technologies.
   Several growing forces combined are providing a major impetus for the
   application of forest dynamics models in natural resource management.
   These include managing impacts of disturbances such as fire, grazing,
   tree harvesting in natural forests, tree clearing and climate change.
   This is coupled by strong legal requirements for managing forests in a
   sustainable manner including compliance to predetermined outcomes in
   terms vegetation structure and species composition.
   Evolving technological advances in computing and accessibility of
   computers to decision makers provide an opportunity for delivering tools
   to support decision making on sustainable management of forests for
   multiple uses. The EPA has adapted a generic forest dynamics simulation
   model and enhanced it in order to support vegetation management
   decisions. We have trialled this new model (Ecosystem Dynamics Simulator
   (EDS)) on wet/dry sclerophyll forests and brigalow vegetation types in
   Queensland.
   In this paper, EDS was used to investigate the likely long-term impacts
   of a proposed onceonly tree harvest at Pile Gully State forests, on
   woody species composition and diameter size class distribution and in
   relation to conservation of forest fauna. Two scenarios were examined:
   (1) no harvesting; and (2) harvest of all trees having suitable
   commercial characteristics and having diameter greater than 30 cm. The
   impacts of the harvest were examined against EPA Code of Practice for
   Native Forest Timber Production in Queensland. These results showed that
   species composition and size class distribution were not adversely
   affected. EDS can play a useful role is estimating the long-term impacts
   of a forest disturbance such as selective harvesting of trees in complex
   sclerophyll forests.}},

Abstract = {{Neural Networks have the capability to approximate nonlinear functions
   to a high degree of accuracy owing to its nonlinear processing in the
   hidden layer neurons. However, the optimum network structure that is
   required for solving a particular problem is still an active area of
   research. In the past, several network pruning methods based on weight
   magnitude or sensitivity have been proposed and some example are
   magnitude based pruning (MBP) (Hagiwara, 1993); optimal brain damage
   (OBD) and its variants (Cun et al., 1990); and variance nullity
   (Engelbrecht, 2001). For example, in MBP, weights that are small are
   removed. How small is `small' is a subjective decision. In OBD, weights
   that are not important for input-output mapping are found and removed.
   This is based on a saliency measure, si of a weight, as given in Eq. 1,
   that is an indication of the cost of setting it to zero. The larger the
   si, the greater the influence of w(i) on error. It is computed from the
   Hessian (H) which is the matrix containing the second derivative of
   error with respect to a pair of weights in the network.
   s(i) = H-ii w(i)(2) / 2 (1)
   Saliency threshold however, is a subjective decision. Variance nullity
   measure proposes a variance analysis of the sensitivity of the output of
   the network to perturbation of weights. It is based on a hypothesis test
   using chi(2) (chi square) distribution to test statistically if a weight
   should be pruned. Here, null variance threshold must be defined. Teoh et
   al. (2006) proposes singular value decomposition (SVD) of hidden neuron
   activation to determine correlated neuron activations in order to select
   the required number of hidden neurons; however, the method requires
   heuristic judgment in setting up of a threshold parameter in the
   criteria for determining the optimum number of neurons. Xian et al.
   (2005) proposes an approach that utilizes the knowledge of the shape of
   the target function to determine the optimum number of neurons. This
   approach is efficient for 2- or 3-dimensional data where the shape of
   the target function can be ascertained relatively easily. However, the
   method cannot be applied to high-dimensional data as the target function
   cannot be visualized for such data. Another approach for optimising
   network structure is genetic and evolutionary algorithms (Castillo et
   al., 2000; Yao, 1999) that involve extensive and time consuming search,
   and in comparison to other network optimisation methods, these provide
   the least insight into the operation of a network.
   In this paper, a new method based on the correlation of the weighted
   activation of the hidden neurons combined with the Self Organisation
   Feature Maps is presented for obtaining the optimum network structure
   efficiently. In an extensive search for internal consistency of hidden
   neuron activation patterns in a network, it was found that the weighted
   hidden neuron activations feeding the output neuron(s) displayed
   remarkably consistent patterns. Specifically, redundant hidden neurons
   exhibit weighted activation patterns that are highly correlated.
   Therefore, the paper proposes identifying hidden neurons with weighted
   activation patterns that are highly correlated and using one neuron to
   represent a group of correlated neurons. The paper proposes to automate
   this process in two steps: 1) Map the correlated weighted hidden neuron
   activation patterns onto a self organising map; and 2) Form clusters of
   SOM neurons themselves to find the maximum likely number of clusters of
   correlated activity patterns. The likely number of clusters on the map
   indicates the required number of hidden neurons to model the data.
   The paper highlights the approach using an example and demonstrates its
   application to solving two problems including a realistic problem of
   predicting river flows in a catchment in New Zealand.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports on a study which combined quantitative and qualitative
   methods to investigate the relationship between Internet use and
   identity, particularly age-identity, in older Internet users. It has a
   theoretical basis in symbolic interactionism - particularly the theories
   of Erving Goffman - and conceptualises identities as roles that are
   negotiated during social interaction.
   The focus on older users was motivated by the strong focus of prior
   Internet research on younger users. Few studies have examined older
   users specifically, and fewer still have examined age-identity.
   Thus, the focus is on how changes in social interaction that occur due
   to Internet use affect the identity negotiation process. The research is
   focused around two key areas: whether older users experience the same
   kinds of online identity processes as younger users, and the impact
   exposure to novel audiences has on identity negotiation.
   The study consisted of two phases. In the first, a quantitative survey
   was administered in which a measure of age-identity was assessed and
   compared with measures of audience novelty. Results showed that a
   significant increase in variance of age-identity is associated with
   communication with people from other countries. This finding supports
   the theory that identity is formed in negotiation with the audience with
   whom one communicates, and that expanding this audience may lead to
   identity effects.
   To investigate this issue more deeply, a qualitative phase was conducted
   in which participants were interviewed using rapid ethnography
   techniques, and at the conclusion of which a model of the interaction
   between age-identity and Internet communication was developed. This
   model was then verified with follow-up interviews with key informants
   and with field observations from sites of online social interaction
   among seniors.
   The model developed during the qualitative stage identifies three ways
   in which age-identity is influenced by social interaction on the
   Internet. First, the Internet is used in response to emotional or
   practical consequences of ageing. Second, older Internet users could
   take advantage of the ability to manage their personal front online to
   achieve agelessness, and third, the Internet is used as a backstage area
   to discuss age-identity issues. The context of these claims is
   all-important; each individual's unique circumstances, emotions and
   motivations influence the way in which they will use the Internet and
   respond to others encountered through it.
   The extension of Goffman's dramaturgical metaphor to age-identity on the
   Internet and to include the concept of character development, in which
   identity evolves over time in response to inner tensions and external
   events, is a tentative but powerful finding. It poses a challenge for
   future research into the nature of identity change, both online and
   offline.}},

Abstract = {{Suicide is a worldwide concern; reducing the suicide rate is a primary
   role of public, government and communities. A computer algorithm, the
   K-Maximum Subarray (K-MSA), is applied for the first time to investigate
   the maximum relationship between the total New Zealand population of
   suicide deaths (1983-2002) by age group, with four selected social
   factors; number of bankruptcies, unemployed people, divorces, and
   orphans and unsupported child beneficiaries, respectively. The range of
   ages from 5 to 80 years is divided into five-year groups, plus a ``more
   than 85 years old{''} group. Social factors are classified into four
   classes (low, med, high and very high) based on their quartile ranges.
   The advantage of using the K-MSA algorithm is that it detects threshold
   values (which age groups associate most with social factors) by
   maximising the sum of the elements of selected subarrays of a
   two-dimensional array; this region is called a maximum subarray. The
   K-MSA has two parameters, K and w. The K-MSA detects K maximum
   subarrays. The weight parameter, w, is generally fixed as the average of
   the values in the full array, but a new approach is introduced to allow
   extracting smaller subsets within the large maximum subarray by changing
   w values (using percentiles from 50, 75, 85 and 95). This results in
   providing the detailed association of the specific suicide age groups
   and social factors.
   The K-MSA with lower w values (e. g., w=50 and 75 percentile)
   successfully identifies the general trends. From the largest maximum
   subarray (at k=1), a similar threshold pattern of social factors between
   bankruptcies and unemployment rate, and divorces and orphans and
   unsupported child beneficiary numbers was found respectively for females
   and males. This may suggest that these two similar factors may impact
   the suicide rate in a similar manner, but different sexes respond
   differently. For the age, the maximum subarray applied to all four
   factors, shows two female age groups; 15-54 and 55-59 years old (plus a
   third, with unemployment rate: 60-64 years old), and one male age group,
   15-59 years old, suggesting that the suicide rate is slightly extended
   out for females than males with the studied social factors.
   Further changing the weight parameter (w=85 and 95) successfully
   detected detailed association of the suicide age and social factor
   level. Overall, very high numbers of divorces are found to be associated
   most with the high suicide rate among other factors. For female, the
   extreme divorce rate associates with the wider female age group, 1544,
   especially for younger females, 15-24 years old. Also, this later age
   group and the late 30s associates with high orphan and unsupervised
   beneficiary numbers, late 30s to early 40s and teenager with extremely
   high bankruptcies, and the early 40s and late 20s with high unemployed
   rate. For male, very high divorce number associates firstly with 30s and
   then 20s, med to high orphan number and med to very high unemployed rate
   with 20s to perhaps up to 34 years old, and the late 30s to early 40s,
   and 20s associate with extremely high and med to high bankruptcies rate,
   respectively.
   An experimental investigation using the K-MSA and a new approach,
   changing the weight parameter successfully provide detailed associations
   for the specific suicide age groups and social factor levels. Results do
   not identify the direct causal factors for the individual suicidal
   behaviour, but represent the national trends. The K-MSA method can be
   further evaluated with different factors as a data mining tool to help
   minimising the future suicide rate by setting up a specific policy for
   the specific age groups for different sexes, and perhaps the
   socioeconomic status as background information.}},

Abstract = {{Using stochastic models of discrete-time data and continuous-time series
   graphs of average values (e. g., annual or monthly) modellers are able
   to analyse many natural systems and phenomena. These models provide
   decision and policymaking management with information on the system
   and/or phenomenon being studied. Nonetheless, since the middle of last
   century modelling needs have changed significantly. The focus is towards
   analysing the ecological dynamics of natural habitats during extreme
   events (i.e. heavy flooding) that could no longer be modelled using
   discrete-time data on normal conditions or average values. For example,
   information relating to the extent of the detrimental effects on a
   coastal habitat biota due to infrastructure failures resulting from
   storm water overflows, the causal factors (i.e., local and/or global) or
   on how these factors influence the system, is required to resolve
   resource and infrastructure management and land development issues.

   In the case of Long Bay Okura-Marine Reserve in northern New Zealand,
   ecological data available is inconsistent (in different formats) and
   this makes ecological dynamics modelling of the coastal habitat
   extremely difficult. The state institutions, such as Auckland Regional
   and North Shore City Councils, monitor beach water quality with many
   sampling locations along the northern coast of Auckland. Academic
   institutions as well carry out ad-hoc monitoring programmes in the
   Reserve (established in 1995) for scientifically validating the
   anecdotal evidence on the effects of urbanisation along this coastal
   habitat (figure 1). However, collectively analysing these data sets to
   model the ecological dynamics of this complex coastal system remains a
   difficult task. The city council efforts to study the effects of
   urbanisation along the beach with conventional methods show the need for
   better tools and data at frequent intervals on extreme conditions i.e.,
   heavy rains.
   Previous research into ecological dynamics modelling using Kohonen's
   self-organising map (SOM) techniques as applied to the monitoring and
   control of highly complex and diverse systems in industrial engineering,
   and their limitations (figure 2a) are explained. Finally, the paper
   explores some simple and complex statistical methods for resolving the
   issues encountered in ecological dynamics modelling of a coastal habitat
   using SOM techniques and discrete-time data from the Okura-Marine
   Reserve (figure 2b).

Abstract = {{These days computer graphics technology has developed rapidly and it can
   represent many things from artificial objects to natural scenes. Also,
   another technology called virtual reality has been improving with stereo
   view, haptic devices and so on. These technologies are used in many
   fields such as industrial, medical, educational, and entertainment
   fields. Especially in movies, representation of human beings is
   important but it takes huge time. Usually, there are some scenarios and
   humans can take actions according to the scenarios. On the other hand,
   there is crowd simulation, which predicts human behaviour based on
   behaviour related psychology. In the case of predicting human movement,
   there are usually some points that humans pass, and some of them are
   selected according to their movement. However, if those points are fixed
   in advance according to their actions, it is difficult to change the
   route by abrupt happing such as encountering friends, changing minds,
   and so forth. Also, if there are many points to pass, it takes much time
   to search for the best selection according to each action, while if
   there is little points, the selected path becomes unnatural. Also, in
   crowd simulation, there are some people who are on the way to move. In
   this case, the path should be changed to avoid the people automatically.
   This paper describes an automatic generation method of dynamic moving
   path for autonomous human model. Humans are modelled based on behaviour
   related psychology so that they can take actions according to their
   minds. For instance, if one person encounters his/her friends on the way
   to a library, they might go to another place together. Also, when it is
   too late to go to a class room for taking a lecture, another person
   might change his/her mind and go to a restaurant for an early lunch. In
   these cases, the routes should be changed dynamically. In this paper,
   humans have only two points for their routes, and add a new point
   according to the environment change, although default points are added
   when nothing happens (Fig. 1 (a)). If many points are prepared for
   humans to move, variety of routes can be generated, but it takes huge
   time to select the best points among them. In this paper, the minimum
   set of points is prepared for movements, and some points are generated
   automatically from the minimum. For example, only one point is prepared
   for wide entrance of a building. Then, two end points and some
   intermediate points are generated automatically. People can select one
   of the generated points for the best route (Fig. 1 (b)). Finally, when
   some people are on the way to move, humans have to avoid them. In this
   case, a new point is generated in order to avoid them, and humans can
   select it (Fig. 1 (c)).

Abstract = {{Researchers and practitioners in the field of natural resource
   management (NRM) have a plethora of simulation models and other tools at
   their disposal. Modellers themselves are often confronted with the need
   to make trade-offs between ``the demands of a general theoretical
   approach and the descriptive accuracy required to model a particular
   phenomenon{''} (p. 4, Pyka and Grebel, 2003). As efforts are made to
   conduct integrated assessments, the tension in this area is exacerbated
   because of the complexity of system interactions and range of
   disciplinary perspectives. One approach that is proffered as providing
   substantial promise for incorporating the human dimension in
   participatory NRM is agent based modelling.
   Agent-based models (ABM) enable individual agents or groups to `behave'
   according to a set of rules or constraints. In multi-agent simulations,
   real-world patterns such as land use/land cover change, resource use or
   afforrestation patterns are emulated. Companion modelling attempts to
   better emulate system outcomes by using informants to characterise the
   `behaviours' of agents in a role playing game. While these techniques
   may provide insight into the impact of decisions in constructed
   environments, practitioners acknowledge the significant effort required
   to characterise or program agents or groups of agents so that an
   adequate representation of adaptation processes occur. As stated by
   Bousquet and Le Page (2004) ``the challenge has been to develop a new
   approach focusing more on the interactions between ecological and social
   components and taking into account the heterogeneity of these
   components{''} (p. 315).
   In this paper, we describe an alternative approach to participatory NRM
   that utilises an interactive modelling/partnership methodology that
   avoids the complexity of trying to characterise human behaviour in a
   computer system. The case study is drawn from our experiences in the
   Central West of New South Wales in Australia, with the Partnerships and
   Understanding Towards Targeted Implementation project (PUTTI). PUTTI is
   a partnership project between Catchment Management Authorities (CMAs),
   landholders, the broader community and researchers at CSIRO. It draws on
   the strengths of several complementary analytical techniques to develop
   a process that integrates across scale (individual farm to catchment) to
   identify and target the drivers that influence people's land management
   practices. Each approach provides insight into the dynamics of the
   decision-making processes of landholders, their social networks, and the
   underlying motivations and factors that influence the way they manage
   their properties. A change program for sustainable land management will
   be developed in close partnership with the community and the CMA.
   In the first phase, a scoping study has informed the development of a
   survey carried out with dryland farmers in the Bell and Cudgegong
   sub-catchments. Structural equation modelling is used to develop a
   preliminary model of the key drivers influencing their land management
   practices. In the second modelling activity, selected respondents from
   the behavioural survey are interviewed and social network analysis used
   to determine the nature and extent of the contacts they use to gain
   information about farming practice and related issues. Finally, we
   intend to work with colleagues involved in modelling of key biophysical
   processes operating at the regional to local scale to conduct workshops
   with the catchment community in ways that utilise the social systems and
   networks and targets the key behavioural drivers. All stages involve
   in-depth individual and group discussions (shed meetings) with
   landholders and others to explore and gain a greater understanding of
   the meaning of the empirical data. All project activities including the
   modelling will feed into a change program developed in close partnership
   with the community and the CMA that aims to achieve sustainable land
   management practices.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure of organisms in the environment to ionizing radiation is
   generally considered to be harmful, regardless of the dose. This
   assumption derives directly from the basic assumption used for human
   radiation protection, that harm is directly proportional to dose,
   without a threshold. The consequence of combined exposures is generally
   unknown, but is assumed to be either additive or multiplicative. We have
   examined the in vivo and in vitro responses of a variety of cells and
   organisms. We show that exposure to one stressor can influence the
   outcome of a subsequent exposure to the same or another stressor. In
   many cases, pre-exposure to one stressor appeared to induce an adaptive
   response that mitigated the harm from a second stressor. These
   observations challenge the basic assumptions used in environmental
   protection strategies, suggesting that new approaches are needed.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{While sexual regeneration of plants after disturbance is relatively well
   understood, vegetative regeneration has attracted some attention only
   recently. Its role along environmental gradients and across biomes is
   poorly known and standard methods for assessment are not yet
   established. We review current knowledge about the role of bud banks in
   vegetative regeneration and the diversity of their modes of functioning.
   The similarities and differences between bud banks and seed banks are
   illustrated, focusing on dormancy, dispersability, seasonal dynamics,
   longevity and storage of carbohydrates. We try to formulate some
   principles that unity bud bank functioning across habitats and growth
   forms: (1) the bud banks consist of all buds which may be used for
   vegetative regeneration, including those formed adventitiously only
   after injury; (2) vertical distribution of buds reflects avoidance of
   disturbance; (3) seasonal changes in the bud bank make vegetative
   regeneration sensitive to timing of disturbance; and (4) ability to form
   adventitious buds provides a potential for vegetative regeneration from
   roots, stumps and leaves. Based on these principles, a simple
   classification of bud banks is presented similar to the classification
   of seed banks. Bud bank traits are considered in relation to severity,
   timing and frequency of disturbance. These include vertical distribution
   and seasonal fluctuations in the number of buds. Methods for
   quantitative assessment of bud numbers and resprouting capacity are
   reviewed, and a new approach based on indirect bud counts is proposed.
   The suggested concept of bud banks may be widely used in studies
   focusing on plant functional traits in relation to disturbance regimes
   at the levels of plant individuals, populations and communities. Its
   further development may incorporate adjustments for areas with
   lion-seasonal climate and refinements for some growth forms, such as
   epiphytes. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A multiphasic approach was applied to investigate the structural
   features of phototrophic biofilms that grow in a wastewater treatment

   analyzed by light (LM) and electron microscopy (SEM), high performance
   liquid chromatography (HPLC) and circular dichroism (CD). Phototroph
   contribution to the 3-dimensional structure of the biofilm and its
   development was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Analysis
   of biofilms grown on polypropylene slides showed a stable species
   composition; seasonal changes in biomass were mostly due to changes of
   major cyanobacterial and algal taxonomic groups. Extensive growth was
   evident on the range of artificial substrata that were implanted in the
   treatment plant. CD spectra and HPLC analyses of 2 operationally defined
   exopolysaccharide fractions extracted from samples scraped off the tank
   walls revealed that negatively charged heteropolysaccharides comprised
   most of the matrix and capsular components of the biofilms. Cytochemical
   staining distinguished between acidic and sulphated residues in the

Abstract = {{Landscape patterns result from complex endogenous dynamics and
   heterogeneity of environmental drivers. Landscape models are appropriate
   tools for analysing such patterns. We present the dynamic, spatially
   explicit, grid-based and spatially linked forest-landscape model
   TreeMig. In each grid cell, the forest dynamics is simulated with a
   multi-species, height structured forest model, based on growth,
   competition and death of the trees in each height class. Within-cell
   heterogeneity is accounted for by assuming that trees are randomly
   distributed resulting in Poisson distributions of tree densities and
   light. Reproduction is modelled explicitly by seed production, seed bank
   dynamics, germination and sapling development. The forests in the
   different cells interact spatially through seed dispersal. The model is
   flexible and can be applied on a range of spatial scales, from single
   stands to entire regions.
   The model's ability to generate patterns was tested in two case studies
   with different spatial resolutions. The first case study shows
   simulations of pattern formation by endogenous dynamics on a small
   spatial scale. The simulations are conducted under spatially and
   temporally homogenous environmental conditions, initialized with seeds
   of all species in the Centre cell. The simulation shows transiently
   several types of patterns in the species biomasses: circular standing
   waves, patch structures and homogenous spread of dominant species. In
   the second, large-scale case study, the tree species' spread since the
   last Ice Age in the Alpine region of the Valais is simulated, under
   temporally and spatially heterogeneous environmental conditions. The
   simulated spatio-temporal pattern consists of immigration waves of new
   species into empty or already forested areas, fast die-backs after
   sharp, strong temperature decreases, slower recolonization after
   temperature increases and spatial separation of the species according to
   the environmental conditions. The simulation indicates that the
   environment forms the basis for the endogenous dynamics, primarily
   migration and competition, which play a particular role during the
   transient phases after drastic changes in the boundary conditions
   (immigration and climate change).
   We conclude that the forest-landscape model TreeMig is able to produce
   landscape patterns resulting from both, endogenous dynamics and
   exogenous drivers and is suitable for a range of different applications.

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2368-2381}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Previously we found that cloned cottonwood saplings (Populus deltoides)
   grew twice as large in New York, New York, USA, compared to surrounding
   rural environments and that soils, temperature, CO2, nutrient
   deposition, and microclimatic variables could not account for the
   greater urban plant biomass. Correlations between final season biomass
   and cumulative O-3 exposures, combined with twofold growth reductions in
   an open-top chamber experiment provided strong evidence that higher
   cumulative O-3 exposures in rural sites reduced growth in the country.
   Here, we assess the field gas exchange, growth and development, and
   allocation responses underlying the observed growth differences and
   compare them with isolated O-3 responses documented in the open-top
   chamber experiment. Cottonwoods showed no visible foliar injury, reduced
   photosynthesis of recently expanded foliage, early leaf senescence,
   protective reduction in stomatal conductance, or compensatory allocation
   to shoot relative to root biomass for either the chamber or field
   experiment. Instead, O-3-impacted chamber plants had significantly
   higher conductance and reduced photosynthesis of older foliage that led
   to reduced leaf area production and a twofold biomass reduction in the
   absence of visible injury. Rural-grown field plants showed the same
   pattern of significantly higher conductance in the absence of
   concomitant increases in photosynthesis that was indicative of a loss of
   stomatal control. Incremental changes in foliar production were also
   significantly inversely related to fluctuations in ambient O-3
   exposures. The similarity in biomass, gas exchange, phenological, and
   allocation responses between chamber and field experiments indicate that
   mechanisms accounting for reduced growth at rural sites were consistent
   with those in the open-top chamber O-3 experiment. This study shows the
   limitation of visible symptoms as a sole diagnostic factor for
   documenting detrimental O-3 impacts and points toward a new approach to
   show O-3 impacts when visible injury is not present. Namely,
   O-3-impacted vegetation showed an unusual inverse relationship of
   increased conductance with lower photosynthesis of older foliage that
   was indicative of a loss of stomatal control. This increased stomatal
   conductance Of O-3-impacted vegetation accentuates pollutant flux into
   affected foliage and has important implications for system water balance
   during warm, dry portions of the growing season when O-3 concentrations
   are highest.}},

Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The study of functional structure in species assemblages emphasizes the
   detection of significant guild aggregation patterns. Thus, protocols
   based on intensive resampling of empirical data have been proposed to
   assess guild structure. Such protocols obtain the frequency distribution
   of a given functional similarity metric, and identify a threshold value
   (often the 95th percentile) beyond which clusters in a functional
   dendrogram are considered as significant guilds (using one-tailed
   tests). An alternative approach sequentially searches for significant
   differences between clusters at decreasing levels of similarity in a
   dendrogram until one is detected, then assumes that all subsequent nodes
   should also be significant. Nevertheless, these protocols do not test
   both the significance and sign of deviations from random at all levels
   of functional similarity within a dendrogram. Here, we propose a new
   bootstrapping approach that: (1) overcomes such pitfalls by performing
   two-tailed tests for each node in a dendrogram of functional similarity
   after separately determining their respective sample distributions, and
   (2) enables the quantification of the relative contribution of guild
   aggregation and functional divergence to the overall functional
   structure of the entire assemblage. We exemplify this approach by using
   long-term data on guild dynamics in a vertebrate predator assemblage of
   central Chile. Finally, we illustrate how the interpretation of
   functional structure is improved by applying this new approach to the
   data set available. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The influence of anthropogenic climate change on organisms is an
   area of great scientific concern. Increasingly there is recognition that
   abrupt climate transitions have occurred over the late Quaternary;
   studies of these shifts may yield insights into likely biotic responses
   to contemporary warming. Here, we review research undertaken over the
   past decade investigating the response of Neotoma (woodrats) body size
   and distribution to climate change over the late Quaternary (the last
   40,000 years). By integrating information from woodrat palaeomiddens,
   historical museum specimens and field studies of modern populations, we
   identify potential evolutionary responses to climate change occurring
   over a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, we
   characterize climatic thresholds in the past that led to local species
   extirpation and/or range alterations rather than in situ adaptation, and
   apply them to anticipate potential biotic responses to anthropogenic
   climate change.
   Location Middens were collected at about 55 sites scattered across the
   western United States, ranging from about 34 to 46 degrees N and about
   104 to 116 degrees W, respectively. Data for modern populations were
   drawn from studies conducted in Death Valley, California, Missoula,
   Montana and the Sevilleta LTER site in central New Mexico.
   Methods We analysed faecal pellets from midden series collected at
   numerous cave sites across the western United States. From these we
   estimated body mass using techniques validated in earlier studies. We
   compared body size fluctuations at different elevations in different
   regions and integrated these results with studies investigating
   temperature-body size tradeoffs in modern animals. We also quantify the
   rapidity of the size changes over the late Quaternary to estimate the
   evolutionary capacity of woodrats to deal with predicted rates of
   anthropogenic climate change over the next century.
   Results We find remarkable similarities across the geographical range to
   late Quaternary climate change. In the middle of the geographical range
   woodrats respond in accordance to Bergmann's rule: colder climatic
   conditions select for larger body size and warmer conditions select for
   smaller body size. Patterns are more complicated at range boundaries,
   and local environmental conditions influence the observed response. In
   general, woodrat body size fluctuates with approximately the same
   amplitude and frequency as climate; there is a significant and positive
   correlation between woodrat body size and generalized climate proxies
   (such as ice core records). Woodrats have achieved evolutionary rates of
   change equal to or greater than those needed to adapt in situ to
   anthropogenic climate change.
   Main conclusions In situ body size evolution is a likely outcome of
   climate change, and such shifts are part of a normal spectrum of
   adaptation. Woodrats appear to be subject to ongoing body size selection
   in response to fluctuating environmental conditions. Allometric
   considerations suggest that these shifts in body size lead to
   substantial changes in the physiology, life history and ecology of
   woodrats, and on their direct and indirect interactions with other
   organisms in the ecosystem. Our work highlights the importance of a
   finely resolved and long-term record in understanding biotic responses
   to climatic shifts.}},

Abstract = {{The use of species traits to characterize the functional composition of
   benthic invertebrate communities has become well established in the
   ecological literature. This approach holds much potential for predicting
   changes of both species and species assemblages along environmental
   gradients in terms of traits that are sensitive to local environmental
   conditions. Further, in the burgeoning field of biomonitoring, a
   functional approach provides a predictive basis for understanding
   community-level responses along gradients of environmental alteration
   caused by humans. Despite much progress in recent years, the full
   potential of the functional traits-based approach is currently limited
   by several factors, both conceptual and methodological. Most notably, we
   lack adequate understanding of how individual traits are intercorrelated
   and how this lack of independence among traits reflects phylogenetic
   (evolutionary) constraint. A better understanding is needed if we are to
   make the transition from a largely univariate approach that considers
   single-trait responses along single environmental gradients to a
   multivariate one that more realistically accounts for the responses of
   many traits across multiple environmental gradients characteristic of
   most human-dominated landscapes. Our primary objective in this paper is
   to explore the issue of inter-trait correlations for lotic insects and
   to identify opportunities and challenges for advancing the theory and
   application of traits-based approaches in stream community ecology. We
   created a new database on species-trait composition of North American
   lotic insects. Using published accounts and expert opinion, we collected
   information on 20 species traits (in 59 trait states) that fell into 4
   broad categories: life-history morphological, mobility, and ecological.
   First, we demonstrate the importance of considering how the linkage of
   specific trait states within a taxon is critical to developing a
   more-robust traits-based community ecology. Second, we examine the
   statistical correlations among traits and trait states for the 311 taxa
   to identify trait syndromes and specify which traits provide unique
   (uncorrelated) information that can be used to guide trait selection in
   ecological studies. Third, we examine the evolutionary associations
   among traits by mapping trait states onto a phylogentic tree derived
   from morphological and molecular analyses and classifications from the
   literature. We examine the evolutionary lability of individual traits by
   assessing the extent to which they are unconstrained by phylogenic
   relationships across the taxa. By focusing on the lability of traits
   within lotic genera of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, taxa
   often used as water-quality indicators, we show how a traits-based
   approach can allow a priori expectations of the differential response of
   these taxa to specific environmental gradients. We conclude with some
   ideas about how specific trait linkages, statistical correlations among
   traits, and evolutionary lability of traits can be used in combination
   with a mechanistic understanding of trait response along environmental
   gradients to select robust traits useful for a more predictive community
   ecology. We indicate how these new insights can direct the research in
   statistical modeling that is necessary to achieve the full potential of
   models that can predict how multiple traits will respond along multiple
   environmental gradients.}},

Abstract = {{An enhanced water-quality monitoring project was established in 2000 for
   streams providing drinking water to New York City (NYC). The project's
   design considered the history of the NYC source watersheds, and some of
   the broader issues facing freshwater supply systems in general. NYC's
   relationship with its watershed has historically been acrimonious and
   filled with mistrust, a situation that became critical in 1989 when the
   US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the Surface Water
   Treatment Rule (SWTR), which required all unfiltered public water-supply
   systems either to provide filtration or to comply with a stringent set
   of water-quality, operational, and watershed-control standards. Plans to
   implement this rule caused further mistrust and lawsuits, which led in
   1997 to the NYC Watershed Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), a compromise
   that was accepted by all the stakeholders. The MOA addressed fundamental
   issues about: 1) the protection, allocation, and ownership of water
   resources, 2) the identification and valuation of ecosystem services, 3)
   the compatibility of environmental protection and economic development,
   and 4) strategies for bringing together diverse stakeholders in the
   watershed. One of the provisions of the MOA was to enhance the existing
   city, state, and federal monitoring programs for NYC's source
   watersheds. The monitoring project described in this series, which is
   part of that enhancement, recognizes philosophically that source
   watersheds and their ecosystems are: 1) the ultimate source of the
   water, 2) the major source of anthropogenic contaminants in the water,
   and 3) the primary natural processors of water-borne contaminants.
   Protecting NYC's source-water areas requires an integrated approach that
   ties historical and contemporary land use into the design of a
   large-scale, enhanced, water-quality monitoring project (the Project).
   The Project set forth 4 primary objectives: 1) to create a quantitative
   baseline of selected physical, chemical, and biological characteristics
   of source-water streams and reservoirs for use in assessing future
   changes in the quality of NYC's drinking water and the integrity of the
   associated aquatic ecosystems, 2) to include in the baseline factors
   that are sensitive to temporal variability, are reproducible, and lend
   themselves to unconfounded analyses among sampling sites and times, 3)
   to integrate temporal and spatial change in both the level of selected
   contaminants and the structure and function of biological communities
   and ecosystems to assess whether impairment impacts the ability of the
   streams to provide ecosystem services related to water quality, and 4)
   to provide additional direction and perspective to the overall watershed
   management plan for the NYC source-water area. All papers in this series
   cover Phase I of the monitoring project, which involved physical,
   chemical, and biological measurements made during 2000 to 2002 at 60
   stream sites distributed across a 5066-km(2) study area.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{765-782}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Question: This paper compares published palynological studies from
   coastal swamps containing the same suite of species. We ask the
   following questions: (1) does succession follow the same pathways in
   different swamp systems, or (2) at different times? If not, (3) how
   variable are the patterns and (4) what are the likely driving factors?
   Location: Great Barrier Island, Northern New Zealand.
   Methods: Eighteen pollen profile diagrams were studied from four
   estuarine wetlands, ranging from mangroves to swamp forest. Recognition
   of a transition between vegetation stages was by subjective
   consideration of the relative abundances of pollen of key indicator
   species at different depths in the sedimentary sequence.
   Results: A linear sequence of vegetation communities beginning with
   mangroves and followed by estuarine marsh communities composed of Juncus
   kraussii, Leptocarpus similis and Baumea juncea was recognised in almost
   all pollen diagrams. Further transitions, from Baumea to a terrestrial
   system of Leptospermum shrubland or Cordyline/Dacrycarpus swamp forest,
   followed two main pathways associated with autogenic accumulation of
   peat and terrigenous sediment input respectively. At Kaitoke and Awana
   the marine/freshwater transition occurred before the arrival of humans
   on Great Barrier Island. At Whangapoua, increased sedimentation followed
   anthropogenic burning of adjacent forest, and this transition was faster
   and is still in progress.
   Conclusion: Palynology and current vegetation zonation patterns concur
   to demonstrate that the marine sedimentation phase of estuarine
   succession is predictable and linear. Baumea marks the transition to the
   freshwater phase, in which varied successional patterns are determined
   by interactions between hydrology, sediment input, and peat
   accumulation. Natural and human disturbances drive sedimentation rates,
   and interact with autogenic factors, to dictate vegetation transitions
   in these later stages. The intensive impact (mainly burning) during
   Polynesian times had a much greater effect on estuaries and swamps than
   the pre-Polynesian natural processes, greatly accelerating plant
   succession.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a national experiment, the Fire and Fire Surrogate Project,
   we evaluated the effects of forest thinning on small mammal population
   densities and total small mammal biomass in ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa)-dominated forests at 2 study areas in northern Arizona and
   northern New Mexico, USA. We also evaluated the effects of wildfire on
   small mammal population densities and biomass after a wildfire burned a
   portion of one study area. Our statistical methods consisted of
   estimation of population densities in combined analyses across space and

   densities. We hypothesized that habitat change postdisturbance would be
   the critical determinant of population responses to thinning and
   wildfire within 1 year of disturbances. Our results largely supported
   this hypothesis, as we documented predicted positive responses to
   thinning for deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), gray-collared chipmunks
   (Tamias cinereicollis), and least chipmunks (T. minimus). We also
   observed predicted positive responses to wildfire for deer mice,
   although our results did not support predicted negative responses to
   wildfire for least chipmunks. Total small mammal biomass generally
   increased following both thinning and wildfire. Our results suggest that
   fuel reduction treatments will have the largest positive impact on small

Abstract = {{Society faces a growing challenge in the management of zoonotic wildlife
   diseases. Unique attributes of zoonotic diseases and the shifting
   sociocultural contexts within which diseases are experienced create
   serious challenges for managers. We address 2 critical questions: how do
   uncertainty and severity associated with a zoonotic disease relate to
   public management attitudes and preferences, and do immigrant attitudes
   and preferences differ from those of long-term residents in rural areas
   of the Intermountain West? We addressed these questions using a
   personally administered questionnaire in Teton County, Idaho, USA. Based
   on 2 hypothetical zoonotic wildlife diseases, one less severe and more
   known (type A) and one more severe and less known (type B), we asked
   respondents to indicate their agreement with 13 statements regarding
   their perception of the disease and management preferences. We also
   asked respondents to indicate their support for different groups
   controlling management. Our compliance rate was 95\% (n = 416, sampling
   error +/- 4.8\%). Respondents considered type B a greater risk to human
   and livestock health, and supported using lethal control methods, except
   hunting, to control it. Disease type, however, had less impact on public
   support for management options involving fencing and supplemental
   feeding. With only 2 exceptions, longer-term residents (LTR) supported
   lethal management options more than newer residents (NR). Further, NR
   hunted less than LTR, thereby restricting lethal management options.
   Respondents indicated some level of support for all management control
   options except giving authority to local civic leaders. Newer residents
   showed higher support for wildlife scientists and federal agencies
   making management decisions, whereas LTR preferred state livestock
   agencies. Demographic change in rural areas may lead to higher levels of
   support for federal and scientific control over zoonotic disease
   management but lower support for lethal management and ability to enact
   lethal management. Our results suggest 2 critical management needs:
   solicitation and consideration of public input for type A zoonotic
   disease management and promotion of hunting or developing a viable
   lethal management alternative.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsic features of organisms, such as morphology or DNA sequences,
   and the stratigraphic occurrence of fossils provide distinct evidence of
   the phylogenetic history of life. Because there is only one true
   history, we expect the historical signals preserved by these data sets
   to be similar, and several metrics have been developed to measure the
   fit of phylogenetic hypotheses to the fossil record. However, a variety
   of biases affect these metrics, and it is unclear whether they can
   provide more than an estimate of whether one tree fits the fossil record
   better than another when used on their own. Here we explore two novel
   applications of stratigraphic fit metrics when they are used with a
   combination of phylogeny reconstruction methods that do and do not
   directly include stratigraphic occurrence data (e.g., cladistics and
   stratocladistics). In particular, we are interested in whether
   differences in the stratigraphic fit of cladistic and stratocladistic
   trees can be used to identify cases in which the stratocladistic results
   are likely to be more accurate, as well as whether such differences can
   be used to identify potential problems in the underlying data sets.
   Using 550 simulated data sets that were analyzed with cladistics and
   stratocladistics, we found that the absolute difference in fit to
   stratigraphy between the results of the two methods was strongly
   correlated with the probability of character state transition and the
   accuracy of the stratocladistic results relative to the cladistic
   results. Completeness of the fossil record and number of taxa included
   in the analysis were more weakly correlated with stratigraphic fit, and
   the statistical significance of the differences in fit between the two
   sets of results did not show a meaningful relationship with improvements
   in accuracy or potential data problems. These results suggest that
   measuring the difference in stratigraphic fit between cladistic and
   stratocladistic trees might be useful for qualitatively estimating
   whether the addition of stratigraphic data benefited a phylogenetic
   analysis, and for identifying data sets with high average rates of
   character state change.}},

Abstract = {{Models predicting species spatial distribution are increasingly applied
   to wildlife management issues, emphasising the need for reliable methods
   to evaluate the accuracy of their predictions. As many available
   datasets (e.g. museums, herbariums, atlas) do not provide reliable
   information about species absences, several presence-only based analyses
   have been developed. However, methods to evaluate the accuracy of their
   predictions are few and have never been validated. The aim of this paper
   is to compare existing and new presenceonly evaluators to usual
   presence/absence measures.
   We use a reliable, diverse, presence/absence dataset of 114 plant
   species to test how common presence/absence indices (Kappa, MaxKappa,
   AUC, adjusted D-2) compare to presenceonly measures (AVI, CVI, Boyce
   index) for evaluating generalised linear models (GLM). Moreover we
   propose a new, threshold-independent evaluator, which we call
   ``continuous Boyce index{''}. All indices were implemented in the
   B10MAPPER software.
   We show that the presence-only evaluators are fairly correlated (p >
   0.7) to the presence/absence ones. The Boyce indices are closer to AUC
   than to MaxKappa and are fairly insensitive to species prevalence. In
   addition, the Boyce indices provide predicted-toexpected ratio curves
   that offer further insights into the model quality: robustness, habitat
   suitability resolution and deviation from randomness. This information
   helps reclassifying predicted maps into meaningful habitat suitability
   classes. The continuous Boyce index is thus both a complement to usual
   evaluation of presence/absence models and a reliable measure of
   presence-only based predictions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {{Questions: Were continued groundwater discharge and mowing regimes
   sufficient for vegetation preservation from 1944 to 1993? Which has a
   stronger effect on vegetation development; groundwater discharge or
   mowing? What is the role of surface water eutrophication as driver of
   vegetation change?
   Location: Het Hol, The Netherlands (ca. 92 ha, 52 degrees 13' N, 5
   degrees 05' E).
   Methods: Hydrology was simulated for the late 1940s, early 1960s and
   1987. Vegetation maps (1944, 1960, 1975 and 1993) were compared for
   biotope cover. Vegetation recordings in 1944 and 1987 were compared.
   Surface water quality was compared between 1950 and 1987. Which sites
   were mown was reconstructed from an interview. Effects of periodic
   mowing and groundwater discharge on vegetation development were tested
   for correlation.
   Results: Biotope diversity reduced significantly through decrease of
   semi-aquatic and tall-herb biotopes, and expansion of forest. The
   quagfen terrestrialization sere nearly disappeared from 1987 recordings,
   while the reed sere did well concerning abundance and species richness.
   Several typical (rich) fen species disappeared from recordings, while
   new species were mostly field margin species. Periodic mowing and
   discharge combined are correlated with increasing species numbers. The
   P-concentration in surface water increased while N-concentration
   decreased.
   Conclusions: Preservation of the reed sere was successful, whereas
   preservation of the quagfen sere was not. Periodic mowing and discharge
   stimulate species richness, discharge more so than periodic mowing. But
   slight eutrophication likely induced a shift from P-limitation to
   N-limitation, which stimulated the reed sere at the expense of the
   quagfen sere.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Which nutrient limits primary production in a lake created by
   flooding industrial cutaway peatland?
   Location: Clongawny Lake (53 degrees 10' N, 07 degrees 53' W), County
   Offaly, Ireland
   Methods: Nutrient concentrations in lake water and the dynamics of
   phytoplankton populations were monitored over a 38-month period. The
   ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to total phosphorus (DIN:TP) and
   nutrient enrichment bio-assays were used to investigate temporal changes
   in nutrient limitation.
   Results: Primary production in the new lake was phytoplankton-driven due
   to the scarcity of recolonizing macrophytes. Phytoplankton growth was
   initially phosphorus-limited. The runoff of phosphate fertilizer from an
   adjacent coniferous forestry plantation raised the TP concentration of
   lake water 5.5-fold. Consequently, the biovolume of phytoplankton
   increased 30-fold, and chlorophyll-a concentrations increased eightfold,
   reaching hyper-eutrophic levels. A concurrent depletion of nitrogen in
   lake water reduced the DIN:TP ratio from 17.8 to 0.6, and phytoplankton
   growth rapidly became nitrogen-limited. Phytoplankton composition
   shifted from dinoflagellates to minute, unicellular chlorophytes, with a
   coincident decline in species diversity. Cyanobacteria did not
   proliferate, most likely due to the acidic nature of the lake.
   Conclusions: Results illustrated the vulnerability of newly created
   cutaway peatland lakes to developing severe phytoplankton blooms and
   coincident secondary nitrogen limitation in the presence of moderate
   external phosphorus inputs.}},

Abstract = {{Human domination of the Earth has resulted in dramatic changes to global
   and local patterns of biodiversity. Biodiversity is critical to human
   sustainability because it drives the ecosystem services that provide the
   core of our life-support system. As we, the human species, are the
   primary factor leading to the decline in biodiversity, we need detailed
   information about the biodiversity and species composition of specific
   locations in order to understand how different species contribute to
   ecosystem services and how humans can sustainably conserve and manage
   biodiversity. Taxonomy and ecology, two fundamental sciences that
   generate the knowledge about biodiversity, are associated with a number
   of limitations that prevent them from providing the information needed
   to fully understand the relevance of biodiversity in its entirety for
   human sustainability: (1) biodiversity conservation strategies that tend
   to be overly focused on research and policy on a global scale with
   little impact on local biodiversity; (2) the small knowledge base of
   extant global biodiversity; (3) a lack of much-needed site-specific data
   on the species composition of communities in human-dominated landscapes,
   which hinders ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation; (4)
   biodiversity studies with a lack of taxonomic precision; (5) a lack of
   taxonomic expertise and trained taxonomists; (6) a taxonomic bottleneck
   in biodiversity inventory and assessment; and (7) neglect of taxonomic
   resources and a lack of taxonomic service infrastructure for
   biodiversity science. These limitations are directly related to
   contemporary trends in research, conservation strategies, environmental
   stewardship, environmental education, sustainable development, and local
   site-specific conservation. Today's biological knowledge is built on the
   known global biodiversity, which represents barely 20\% of what is
   currently extant (commonly accepted estimate of 10 million species) on
   planet Earth. Much remains unexplored and unknown, particularly in
   hotspots regions of Africa, South Eastern Asia, and South and Central
   America, including many developing or underdeveloped countries, where
   localized biodiversity is scarcely studied or described. ``Backyard
   biodiversity{''}, defined as local biodiversity near human habitation,
   refers to the natural resources and capital for ecosystem services at
   the grassroots level, which urgently needs to be explored, documented,
   and conserved as it is the backbone of sustainable economic development
   in these countries. Beginning with early identification and
   documentation of local flora and fauna, taxonomy has documented global
   biodiversity and natural history based on the collection of ``backyard
   biodiversity{''} specimens worldwide. However, this branch of science
   suffered a continuous decline in the latter half of the twentieth
   century, and has now reached a point of potential demise. At present
   there are very few professional taxonomists and trained local
   parataxonomists worldwide, while the need for, and demands on, taxonomic
   services by conservation and resource management communities are rapidly
   increasing. Systematic collections, the material basis of biodiversity
   information, have been neglected and abandoned, particularly at
   institutions of higher learning.
   Considering the rapid increase in the human population and urbanization,
   human sustainability requires new conceptual and practical approaches to
   refocusing and energizing the study of the biodiversity that is the core
   of natural resources for sustainable development and biotic capital for
   sustaining or life-support system. In this paper we aim to document and
   extrapolate the essence of biodiversity, discuss the state and nature of
   taxonomic demise, the trends of recent biodiversity studies, and suggest
   reasonable approaches to a biodiversity science to facilitate the
   expansion of global biodiversity knowledge and to create useful data on
   backyard biodiversity worldwide towards human sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{A new ecosystem-based climate envelope modeling approach was applied to
   assess potential climate change impacts on forest communities and tree
   species. Four orthogonal canonical discriminant functions were used to
   describe the realized climate space for British Columbia's ecosystems
   and to model portions of the realized niche space for tree species under
   current and predicted future climates. This conceptually simple model is
   capable of predicting species ranges at high spatial resolutions far
   beyond the study area, including outlying populations and southern range
   limits for many species. We analyzed how the realized climate space of
   current ecosystems changes in extent, elevation, and spatial
   distribution under climate change scenarios and evaluated the
   implications for potential tree species habitat. Tree species with their
   northern range limit in British Columbia gain potential habitat at a
   pace of at least 100 km per decade, common hardwoods appear to be
   generally unaffected by climate change, and some of the most important
   conifer species in British Columbia are expected to lose a large portion
   of their suitable habitat. The extent of spatial redistribution of
   realized climate space for ecosystems is considerable, with currently
   important sub-boreal and montane climate regions rapidly disappearing.
   Local predictions of changes to tree species frequencies were generated

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{The Food Security Act of 1985 contained provisions that affected
   wildlife conservation nationwide. Two provisions that most benefited
   waterfowl populations in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) were the
   Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and ``Swampbuster{''} (wetland
   conservation). Permanent cover established under the CRP provides
   attractive nesting habitat for upland-nesting ducks that is more secure
   than other major habitats. Swampbuster has prevented drainage of
   wetlands vital to breeding duck pairs. In 2007 many CRP contracts will
   expire. Deliberations will begin in late 2006 regarding the next Farm
   Bill. The United States Department of Agriculture needs sound biological
   information and scientific analyses to help establish wildlife
   priorities in the Farm Bill. We used data from breeding duck population
   and wetland habitat surveys to develop models for 5 species of
   upland-nesting ducks and applied these models to > 2.6 million wetlands
   in a digital database for the PPR in North and South Dakota, USA. We
   used geographic information systems techniques to identify locations in
   the PPR where CRP cover would be accessible to the greatest number of
   nesting hens. We then summarized distribution of current CRP contracts
   relative to distribution of upland-breeding ducks. We also used our
   models to predict change in the breeding duck population (landscape
   carrying capacity) that might occur if certain wetlands were exempt from
   the Swampbuster provision. Our analyses showed that 75\% of CRP
   contracts as of July 2005 were in areas accessible to high or medium
   numbers of breeding ducks and 25\% were in areas of low populations. We
   suggest a method to prioritize CRP extensions and reenrollment of
   current contracts or target new contracts to maintain or increase duck
   production. Additionally, our models suggested that if the Swampbuster
   provision were removed from future Farm Bills and protected wetland were
   drained, this area of the PPR could experience a 37\% decline in the
   waterfowl populations we studied.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial genetic structure can be characterized for two basic aspects,
   fragmentedness and covariation. While fragmentedness relates to the
   existence of distinct groups, covariation describes situations of joint
   spatial genetic change. Confounding these two structural aspects may
   lead to problematic analyses. Studies of fragmentedness utilize
   clustering and are therefore aimed at ``grouping together localities
   that are geographically adjacent and whose populations are similar in
   their characteristics{''} {[}Gabriel, K.R., Sokal, R.R., 1969. A new
   statistical approach to geographic variation analysis. Syst. Zool. 18,

   that it implies methods of clustering which group jointly rather than
   separately for genetic differences and spatial distances. Such
   ``spatiogenetic{''} methods of clustering seem to have hitherto received
   little attention. A generalized spatiogenetic method of clustering is
   developed and demonstrated for applicability to basic problems of
   revealing, interpreting and quantifying metapopulation and (intra- and
   interspecific) phylogeographic structure, of indicating autochthony, and
   of delineating provenance regions. Asymmetry between spatial distances
   and genetic differences, which flaws analyses of covariation between the
   two components, is revealed by spatiogenetic clustering analysis to play
   a special and central role in shaping spatial genetic structure. (c)

Pages = {{2537-2547}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The pre-historical vegetation structure in temperate forest regions is
   much debated among European and North American ecologists and
   conservationists. Frans Vera's recent hypothesis that large mammals
   created mosaics of forest and openland vegetation in both regions
   throughout the Holocene has been particularly controversial and has
   provoked new approaches to conservation management. Thirty years
   earlier, American paleoecologists Herb Wright and Margaret Davis debated
   whether abundant ragweed pollen at Rogers Lake, Connecticut at 9500 yr
   BP signified local forest openings or long-distance transport of pollen
   from Midwestern prairies. Using new pollen records from Harvard Forest
   and the North American Pollen Database, we address this question and
   offer insights to the openland discussion. Ragweed and other forbs
   exceed 3.5\% at five sites in a restricted area of southern New England
   between 10 100 and 7700 yr BP. Strong evidence suggests this pollen
   originated from the landscapes surrounding these sites (supporting
   Davis), as ragweed pollen percentages do not increase with longitude
   from New England to the Midwest. Ragweed pollen percentages are also
   unrelated to basin size and therefore unrelated to the proportion of
   extraregional pollen in New England. High forbs values were associated
   with increases in oak, decreases in white pine, and relatively high
   charcoal values. Modern pollen records with similar forb and tree
   percentages occur along the Prairie Peninsula region of the Upper
   Midwest. However, the closest analogue to the southern New England early
   Holocene assemblages comes from Massachusetts' Walden Pond in the early
   18th century. These results and the affiliation of ragweed for open,
   disturbed habitats suggest that oak-pine forests with large openings
   persisted for over 2000 years due to dry conditions and perhaps
   increased fire frequency. This conclusion is corroborated by independent
   lake level and climate reconstructions. Because these early Holocene
   openlands have no detectable analogue in New England for the past 7000
   years before European settlement, we suggest that all important
   openlands today are almost exclusively a legacy of Colonial agriculture
   and should be managed accordingly. Nonetheless, our results may have
   implications for forest dynamics accompanying projected climate change
   to more and conditions in New England over the next century.}},

Abstract = {{Aim This study used data from temperate forest communities to assess:
   (1) five different stepwise selection methods with generalized additive
   models, (2) the effect of weighting absences to ensure a prevalence of
   0.5, (3) the effect of limiting absences beyond the environmental
   envelope defined by presences, (4) four different methods for
   incorporating spatial autocorrelation, and (5) the effect of integrating
   an interaction factor defined by a regression tree on the residuals of
   an initial environmental model.
   Location State of Vaud, western Switzerland.
   Methods Generalized additive models (GAMs) were fitted using the grasp
   package (generalized regression analysis and spatial predictions,
   http://www.cscf.ch/grasp).
   Results Model selection based on cross-validation appeared to be the
   best compromise between model stability and performance (parsimony)
   among the five methods tested. Weighting absences returned models that
   perform better than models fitted with the original sample prevalence.
   This appeared to be mainly due to the impact of very low prevalence
   values on evaluation statistics. Removing zeroes beyond the range of
   presences on main environmental gradients changed the set of selected
   predictors, and potentially their response curve shape. Moreover,
   removing zeroes slightly improved model performance and stability when
   compared with the baseline model on the same data set. Incorporating a
   spatial trend predictor improved model performance and stability
   significantly. Even better models were obtained when including local
   spatial autocorrelation. A novel approach to include interactions proved
   to be an efficient way to account for interactions between all
   predictors at once.
   Main conclusions Models and spatial predictions of 18 forest communities
   were significantly improved by using either: (1) cross-validation as a
   model selection method, (2) weighted absences, (3) limited absences, (4)
   predictors accounting for spatial autocorrelation, or (5) a factor
   variable accounting for interactions between all predictors. The final
   choice of model strategy should depend on the nature of the available
   data and the specific study aims. Statistical evaluation is useful in
   searching for the best modelling practice. However, one should not
   neglect to consider the shapes and interpretability of response curves,
   as well as the resulting spatial predictions in the final assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: To what extent can spatial structure and its causes be

   Location: Wimmera region of southern Australia.
   Methods: Broad-leaved weeds were counted in 225 000 contiguous 20-cm
   square quadrats. A substantial number of these quadrats were recorded
   again after two and four years. An hierarchical `adaptive analysis'
   approach was used to select spatial analytical methods to examine
   specific aspects of pattern and variation in pattern from year to year.
   Results: Patterns varied among species and included both dense and
   sparse patches surrounded by areas of zero density, diffuse gradations
   of density and clear anisotropy. Patterns in Erodium botrys and Oxalis
   pes-caprae persisted over years, whereas patterns in Arctotheca
   calendula were less pronounced and varied over time. Edaphic factors
   appeared to have only a minor influence over the spatial distribution of
   the weed community as a whole. In Oxalis pes-caprae, whose patches were
   hypothesized to have been shaped by cultivation, there was no spread in
   four years, despite further tillage. Outlying plants of O.pes-caprae
   failed to establish new patches, even in the year of greatest population
   increase. Little evidence of localised recruitment events was found.
   Conclusions: Despite repeated annual disturbances by natural and
   anthropogenic mechanisms, clear and interpretable spatial structure
   develops in annual weeds over a range of spatial resolutions. Adaptive

Abstract = {{Questions: How do gap abundance and the spatial pattern of trees and

   spatial pattern differ among site types and structural components of a

   Location: Boreal forests dominated by Picea mariana, northern Quebec and
   Ontario. Canada.
   Methods: Data on the abundance, characteristics and spatial location of
   trees, snags and gaps were collected along 200 m transects at 91 sites
   along a chronosequence. Spatial analyses included 3TLQV, NLV and
   autocorrelation analysis. Nonparametric analyses were used to analyse
   trends with time and differences among structural components and site
   types.
   Results: Gaps became more abundant, numerous and more evenly distributed
   with time. At distances of 1-4 m, tree cover, sapling density and snag
   density became more heterogeneous with time. Tree cover appeared to be
   more uniform for the 1033 m interval, although this was not significant.
   Patch size and variance at 1 m were greater for overstorey than for
   understorey tree cover. Snags were less spatially variable than trees at
   1 m, but more so at intermediate distances (4 - 8 m). Few significant
   differences were found among site types.
   Conclusions: During stand development in P. mariana forest, gaps formed
   by tree mortality are filled in slowly due to poor regeneration and
   growth, leading to greater gap abundance and clumping of trees and snags
   at fine scales. At broader scales. patchy regeneration is followed by
   homogenization of forest stands as trees become smaller with low

Abstract = {{Models of biparental care predict that parents should compensate
   incompletely for any change in their partner's investment. Experimental
   tests have, however, yielded results that range from full compensation,

   a new, adaptive explanation for such variation. Building on an approach

   over offspring care. We show that when each parent has only partial
   information, greater effort invested by one serves as a signal to the
   other of brood need. This favors a matching response by the focal
   parent's mate, whereas the impact of increased effort on the marginal
   value of investment favors a compensatory response. The net outcome
   depends on the relative strength of these two effects. The greater the
   variation in brood need compared with parental state, the weaker the
   predicted level of compensation, and the more likely matching is to
   occur. Our model also suggests why males and females might respond
   differently to each other. If there is an informational asymmetry
   between them, then the parent that is better informed about brood need
   should work harder, respond more strongly to changes in brood need, be
   less sensitive to changes in the cost of feeding, and compensate more
   strongly for changes in partner effort. If the asymmetry is very great,
   the poorly informed parent may even match changes in its partner's work
   rate.}},

Abstract = {{Modelling of climate change-induced species range shifts has generally
   addressed migration limitations inadequately, often assuming `null'
   migration or instantaneous `full' migration extremes. We describe
   methods for incorporating simple migration rate assumptions into
   multispecies modelling, using the Proteaceae of the Cape Floristic
   Region. Even with optimistic migration assumptions, range loss
   projections more closely approximate null migration than full migration
   assumptions. Full migration results were positively skewed by few
   species with large range increases, an overestimate eliminated by
   dispersal-limited migration rate assumptions. Wind- and
   ant/rodent-dispersed species responded differently to climate change.
   Initially larger ranges of wind-dispersed species were more strongly
   reduced by climate change, despite far greater assumed dispersal
   distances - we suggest that these well-dispersed species populate more
   marginal areas of potential range, causing lower resilience to climatic
   changes at range margins. Overall, range loss rate slowed with advancing
   climate change, possibly because species ranges contracted into core
   areas most resilient to climate change. Thus, a consideration of simple
   dynamics of range change (rather than single step, present-future
   comparisons of range) provide new insights relevant for conservation
   strategies, in particular, and for guiding monitoring efforts to detect
   and gauge the impacts of climate change on natural populations.}},

Title = {{The ontogeny of trilobite segmentation: a comparative approach}},
Journal = {{PALEOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{602-627}},
Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{Ontogenetic stages of trilobites have traditionally been recognized on
   the basis of the development of exoskeletal segmentation. The
   established protaspid, meraspid, and holaspid phases relate specifically
   to the development of articulated joints between exoskeletal elements.
   Transitions between these phases were marked by the first and last
   appearances of new trunk segment articulations. Here we propose an
   additional and complementary ontogenetic scheme based on the generation
   of new trunk segments. It includes an anamorphic phase during which new
   trunk segments appeared, and an epimorphic phase during which the number
   of segments in the trunk remained constant. In some trilobites an
   ontogenetic boundary can also be recognized at the first appearance of
   morphologically distinct posterior trunk segments. Comparison of the
   phase boundaries of these different aspects of segment ontogeny
   highlights rich variation in the segmentation process among Trilobita.
   Cases in which the onset of the holaspid phase preceded onset of the
   epimorphic phase are here termed protarthrous, synchronous onset of both
   phases is termed synarthromeric, and onset of the epimorphic phase
   before onset of the holaspid phase is termed protomeric. Although these
   conditions varied among close relatives and perhaps even
   intraspecifically in some cases, particular conditions may have been
   prevalent within some clades.
   Trilobites displayed hemianamorphic development that was accomplished
   over an extended series of juvenile and mature free-living instars.
   Although developmental schedules varied markedly among species,
   morphological transitions during trilobite development were generally
   regular, limited in scope, and extended over a large number of instars
   when compared with those of many living arthropods. Hemianamorphic,
   direct development with modest change between instars is also seen among
   basal members of the Crustacea, basal myriapods, pycnogonids, and in
   some fossil chelicerates. This mode may represent the ancestral
   condition of euarthropod development.}},

Volume = {{197}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{320-330}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{Ecological data frequently contain multiple patterns. A process model of
   the system producing the data should be able to recreate those patterns.
   We describe a method and associated software where components of the
   pattern are used as multiple criteria to assess a model during its
   construction. Successive improvements are made to the model so that it
   describes more components of the pattern effectively.
   The software, Pareto-Evolve is an evolutionary algorithm. Initially it
   creates many individual sets of model parameters, each is used in the
   model to produce results that are then compared to patterns in a data
   set. Different individuals may achieve different components of the
   pattern and Pareto-Evolve calculates those that are most effective and
   uses them to produce new individuals. This is done by changing parameter
   values of individuals, called mutation, or exchanging parameter values
   between individuals, called crossover. This process is repeated over
   many generations so that a most effective parameterization evolves.
   We illustrate this method with a model for hourly increments of
   extension of the leading shoot of a conifer tree. The particular task
   here is to model water uptake by the plant in response to water loss due
   to transpiration, calculate a water deficit between uptake and loss, and
   calculate contraction and re-expansion of shoot tissue due to diurnal
   changes in tissue water deficit. We choose criteria corresponding to
   different phases in the diurnal pattern of expansion and model for up to
   six consecutive days. A value is set marking the limit within which the
   model must achieve the criteria for it to be judged as success.
   This value is called a binary discrepancy measure. Pareto-Evolve is used
   to make multiple searches with successively smaller binary discrepancy
   measures until all criteria are no longer achieved. At this point
   different parameter sets achieve different groups of criteria and we use
   these as indicators of how the structure of the model must be improved
   to achieve an overall better fit. In our example we find that
   contraction is more rapid than re-expansion, which is a hysteresis
   effect, and that re-expansion of tissue continues after water deficit
   within the tissue is estimated to have been removed.
   We discuss how this method can be used in model development and
   particularly how multiple criteria assessment can be used in model
   development. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This is the first part of a two-part paper which offers a new approach
   to the valuation of ecosystem goods and services. The existing
   literature on environmental valuation is based on two distinct
   foundations. The ecological valuation methods derive values by a

   exchange value of ecosystem services. Their common characteristic is
   that they are finally based on consumer preferences, and do not
   adequately take account of the complex internal structure of ecosystems.
   As the existing methods for the valuation of ecosystem services
   emphasize either the economic system or the ecosystem, the main
   objective of part 1 is to provide the conceptual foundations for a new
   method of valuation of ecosystem services, which deals simultaneously
   with the ecosystem, the economic system and society in a balanced way.

Abstract = {{Detecting range shifts and contractions is critical for determining the
   conservation priority of rare and declining taxa. However, data on rare
   species occurrences frequently lack precise information on locations and
   habitats and may present a biased picture of biogeographic distributions
   and presumed habitat preferences. Herbarium or museum specimen data,
   which otherwise could be useful proxies for detecting temporal trends
   and spatial patterns in species distributions, pose particular
   challenges. Using data from herbaria and Natural Heritage Programs on
   numbers of occurrences within individual municipalities (towns, cities,
   or townships), we quantified temporal changes in the estimated
   distributions of 110 rare plant species in the six New England (USA)
   states. We used the partial Solow equation and a nonparametric test to
   estimate the probability of observing multiple absences (gaps in the
   collection record) if a given population was actually still extant.
   Bayes' Theorem was used to estimate the probability that occurrences
   were misclassified as extinct. Using the probabilities obtained from
   these three methods, we eliminated taxa with high probabilities of
   pseudo-absence (that would yield an inaccurate profile of species
   distributions), narrowing the set for final analysis to 71 taxa. We then
   expressed occurrences as centroids of town polygons and estimated
   current and historical range areas (extents of occurrence as defined by
   alpha-hulls inscribing occurrences), mean distances between occurrences,
   and latitudinal and longitudinal range boundaries. Using a geographic
   information system, we modeled first; second, and third circular
   standard deviational polygons around the mean center of the historical
   range. Examining the distribution of current occurrences within each
   standard deviational polygon, we asked whether ranges were collapsing to
   a center, expanding, fragmenting, or contracting to a margin of the
   former range. Extant ranges of the species were, on average, almost 67\%
   smaller than their historical ranges, and distances among occurrences
   decreased. Five New England hotspots were observed to contain > 35\% of
   rare plant populations. Extant occurrences were more frequently
   marginalized at the periphery of the historical range than would be
   expected by chance. Coarse-grained data on current and historical
   occurrences can be used to examine large suites of species to prioritize
   taxa and sites for conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Carotenoid-based colors are thought to play an important signaling role
   in many animal taxa. However, little is known about evolutionary changes
   in carotenoid coloration, especially among closely related species. We
   used a phylogenetic perspective to examine carotenoid color changes

   quantitatively measured using reflectance spectrometry. We found
   continuous variation from short- to long-wavelength carotenoid colors in
   extant orioles-perceived by humans as ranging from yellow to
   scarlet-suggesting that these carotenoid-based colors have evolved as a
   continuous character. Ancestral state reconstruction suggests that
   short- and long-wavelength carotenoid colors have evolved independently
   multiple times, likely from a middle-wavelength ancestor. Although color
   showed considerable lability, we found a significant amount of
   phylogenetic signal across the entire genus. This implies that while
   labile, the colors of closely related taxa tended to resemble each other
   more than would be expected due to chance. To our knowledge, this is the
   first study to use quantitative character states derived from
   reflectance spectra in ancestral state reconstruction. Reflectance
   spectra provide an unbiased quantitative description of color that

   these quantitative methods to score and reconstruct color changes among

Abstract = {{The introduction of rats and other mammalian predators has caused many

   footprint-tracking index is used to assess effectiveness of control. To
   assess the meaning of this index for native populations, it I,,,
   necessary to model the functional relationships between
   predator-tracking rates and vital rates of native populations. We
   monitored North Island robins (Petroica longipes) for 5 years after
   reintroduction to Paengaroa Mainland Island, and rat levels changed
   dramatically over this period due to changes in management policy. We
   used the resulting data to model how vital rates varied with rat
   tracking, using Akaike's Information Criterion to compare alternative
   models for each vital rate. We fitted survival models to mark-resighting
   data obtained in tri-annual surveys of the reserve, and we fitted
   fecundity models to data on numbers of independent young produced by
   individual females. The best model for annual adult survival was =

Abstract = {{The landscape of Mediterranean mountain areas in north-eastern Spain, in
   particular lands traditionally devoted to vineyard cropping, is rapidly
   changing. This is due to new terrace construction, being built without
   any environmental impact considerations utilizing heavy machinery. The
   European Union regulation policy for vineyards' restructuring, which
   subsidize up to 50\% of the land terracing costs, encourages this
   activity. A clear example of this situation occurs in the Priorat region
   (Catalonia, NE Spain), where vineyards were first cultivated in the XII
   century on hillslopes with terracing systems utilizing small stone
   walls. However, since the 1980s-1990s, the viticulture boom is based on
   a new terracing system, relying on mechanization and resulting in high
   negative environmental and landscape impacts. This paper tackles several
   aspects that this modern land terracing/vineyard system has initiated in
   the Priorat: (a) the land use changes and rates of changes during the
   last two decades, in order to determine the magnitude of the
   environmental and landscape dynamics problem, (b) the assessment of the
   terrain morphology changes due to land terracing (volumes of soil
   displaced, slope morphology and slope degree changes) and (c) an
   analysis of the cost of the restructuring operations, mainly land
   terracing, subsidized by the EU policy for vineyards' restructuring. In
   this respect, the effects of this policy are discussed. The results show
   that modern land terracing methods produce huge material displacements
   (about 9460 +/- 900 Mg ha(-1)). These figures approximate the range of
   catastrophic natural mass movements and confirm land terracing as an
   antrophic geomorphic processes which is rapidly reshaping the terrain
   morphology. Land terracing costs, which represent 34\% of the total
   costs for a new terraced vineyard, is the operation which receives the
   maximum EU subsidy. This has encouraged vine growers in the Priorat
   region to create new plantations, increasing significantly the
   transformation rate from 7.5 ha year(-1) between 1986 and 1998 to 36.1

Abstract = {{Ecologists often point to excessive truncation of a population's
   size-structure as a deleterious effect of exploitation, yet the effect
   of this truncation on population persistence is seldom quantified. While
   persistence of marine populations requires maintenance of a sufficient
   level of lifetime reproduction, fishing reduces lifetime reproduction by
   increasing the total mortality rate, preventing individuals from growing
   old, large, and highly fecund. We employ a new method of estimating
   changes in lifetime egg production (LEP) using two samples of the size
   structure, one in the past and one current, to assess persistence of
   five species of nearshore rockfish (Sebastes spp.) in California and
   Oregon, USA. Using length frequency data from catch in the recreational
   fishery, we estimate that since 1980, four of the five rockfish species
   considered have experienced declines in LEP to levels that suggest that
   persistence is impaired. When changes in LEP were estimated for subsets
   of the data corresponding to neighboring geographical regions,
   differences in LEP levels were apparent in the neighboring regions,
   implying that the effects of fishing mortality are not evenly
   distributed over space. We conclude by discussing the use of this

Abstract = {{Phenotypic variability is the engine that drives future diversification
   with the expectation that polymorphic ancestors give rise to descendants
   harboring a subset of the ancestral variation. Here we examine
   evolutionary transitions from polymorphism to monomorphism in a visually
   striking New World radiation of fruit flies, the Drosophila cardini
   group. This group is distributed across the Americas and the Caribbean
   islands and exhibits a wide spectrum of abdominal pigmentation
   variation. Specifically, the D. dunni subgroup consists of Caribbean
   island endemics, each of which is monomorphic for its pigmentation
   pattern, with an interspecific cline of pigmentation across the islands.
   The D. cardini subgroup consists of American continental species with
   wide-ranging distributions and intraspecifically variable abdominal
   pigmentation. We determined the phylogeny of 18 species and subspecies
   using three nuclear and three mitochondrial regions analyzed with
   maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods. The
   topology produced from a combined dataset exhibited high support values
   at all nodes, and differed from earlier phylogenetic hypotheses based on
   polytene chromosome inversion patterns and isozyme data. We find that
   the D. dunni subgroup species, with the exception of D. belladunni, are
   derived from a single source not of direct South American origin and
   their dispersal across the islands of the Caribbean does not follow a
   simple stepping-stone model. Morphological changes in pigmentation
   across the island species are incongruent with the colonization history
   of the group indicating that natural selection may have played a role in
   the determination of this character. Finally, we demonstrate that
   monomorphic species have arisen independently from polymorphic ancestors
   two to three times.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{One of the ways in which risk assessment can inform life-cycle analysis
   (LCA) is by providing a mechanism to translate midpoint categories into
   common endpoints. Although this analytical step is complex and often
   highly uncertain, it can allow for prioritization among disparate
   midpoints and subsequent analytical refinements focused on the endpoints
   that dominate policy decisions. In this article, we present an approach
   to address three widely differing impact categories-particulate matter
   air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and personal income. We use the
   case of increased residential insulation as a measure to reduce energy
   consumption, which implies economic and public health tradeoffs across
   all three categories. We apply previously developed models that combined
   input-output LCA and risk assessment to address public health impacts
   from particulate matter, and extend the framework to address greenhouse
   gases and the public health consequences of changes in income. For a
   hypothetical loan program applied to both new and existing single-family
   homes, we find a payback period of approximately one year for the
   particulate matter and greenhouse gas-related midpoints and endpoints,
   with the structure of the loan implying that no economic payback is
   required. Our central estimates for avoided disability adjusted life
   years (DALYs) for a 50-year period are approximately 200,000 for
   particulate matter, 900,000 for greenhouse gases, and 300,000 for income
   changes, although values are highly dependent on discount rates and
   other model assumptions. We conclude that all three impact categories
   are potentially significant in this case, indicating that analytical
   refinements should be considered for all three impact categories to
   reduce model uncertainties. Our study demonstrates how LCA and risk
   assessment can work together in a framework that includes multiple
   impact categories, aiding in the evaluation of the net impacts of an
   energy policy change on society.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The Argentine Pampas was extensively and abruptly altered by
   European colonization. Between 1880 and 1885 the indigenous human
   inhabitants were completely displaced, and native grasslands were
   replaced by exotic pasture plants and crops. One of the most important
   ecological changes in the Pampas landscape, the introduction of tall
   exotic tree species, has received little attention, and its effect on
   wildlife has never been assessed. We have made an intensive survey of
   habitat use of Swainson's hawk, Buteo swainsoni in its most important
   non-breeding quarters, the Pampas of Argentina, aiming to characterize
   the sites used by hawks for communal roosting.
   Location Pampas grasslands, Argentina.
   Methods We surveyed 30,000 km of roads by car during the austral summer
   from 2001 to 2004, covering the main non-breeding area occupied by
   Swainson's hawks. Their roost sites were located by direct observation
   of birds roosting in tree stands close to the roads, by surveying
   potential roost sites around places where groups of pre- and
   post-roosting hawks were recorded, and by gathering information from
   local farmers.
   Results Swainson's hawks exclusively used stands of exotic tree species
   for roosting. Eucalyptus viminalis was present in all 34 roosts
   surveyed, and in 59\% of them it was the only species present. The
   remaining exotic tree species were the Siberian elm, Ulmus pumila, pines
   (Pinus spp.) and cypress (Cupressus spp.). Flock sizes at roost sites
   were unusually high for a raptor, with an average of 658 individuals
   (range 8-5000 hawks, n = 27 flocks).
   Main conclusions The introduction of exotic trees may have resulted in
   the expansion of the suitable habitat for Swainson's hawks, permitting a
   recent colonization of the Argentine Pampas. Tree stands may have also
   changed the communal roosting behaviour of this raptor, by virtue of
   their providing new structural elements in a region that almost
   completely lacked trees prior to European occupation.}},

Abstract = {{Aim There has been considerable debate about pre-settlement stand
   structures in temperate woodlands in south-eastern Australia.
   Traditional histories assumed massive tree losses across the region,
   whereas a number of recent histories propose that woodlands were
   originally open and trees regenerated densely after settlement. To
   reconcile these conflicting models, we gathered quantitative data on
   pre-settlement stand structures in Eucalyptus-Callitris woodlands in
   central New South Wales Australia, including: (1) tree density,
   composition, basal area and canopy cover at the time of European
   settlement; and (2) post-settlement changes in these attributes.
   Location Woodlands dominated by Eucalyptus species and Callitris
   glaucophylla, which originally occupied approximately 100,000 km(2) in
   central New South Wales, Australia.
   Methods We recorded all evidence of pre-settlement trees, including
   stumps, stags and veteran trees, from 39 relatively undisturbed 1-ha
   stands within 16 State Forests evenly distributed across the region.
   Current trees were recorded in a nested 900 m(2) quadrat at each site.
   Allometric relationships were used to estimate girth over bark at breast
   height, tree basal area, and crown diameter from the girth of cut
   stumps. A post-settlement disturbance index was developed to assess
   correlations between post-settlement disturbance and attributes of
   pre-settlement stands.
   Results The densities of all large trees (> 60 cm girth over bark at
   breast height) were significantly greater in current stands than at the
   time of European settlement (198 vs. 39 trees ha(-1)). Pre-settlement
   and current stands did not differ in basal area. However, the
   proportional representation of Eucalyptus and Callitris changed
   completely. At the time of settlement, stands were dominated by
   Eucalyptus (78\% of basal area), whereas current stands are dominated by
   Callitris (74\%). On average, Eucalyptus afforded 83\% of crown cover at
   the time of settlement. Moreover, the estimated density, basal area and
   crown cover of Eucalyptus at the time of settlement were significantly
   negatively correlated with post-settlement disturbance, which suggests
   that these results underestimate pre-settlement Eucalyptus
   representation in the most disturbed stands.
   Main conclusions These results incorporate elements of traditional and
   recent vegetation histories. Since European settlement, State Forests
   have been transformed from Eucalyptus to Callitris dominance as a result
   of the widespread clearance of pre-settlement Eucalyptus and dense
   post-settlement recruitment of Callitris. Tree densities did increase
   greatly after European settlement, but most stands were much denser at
   the time of settlement than recent histories suggest. The original
   degree of dominance by Eucalyptus was unexpected, and has been
   consistently underestimated in the past. This study has greatly refined
   our understanding of post-settlement changes in woodland stand
   structures, and will strengthen the foundation for management policies
   that incorporate historical benchmarks of landscape vegetation changes.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to assess land-use intensity and the
   related biodiversity in agricultural landscapes of the EU25 for the
   current situation (2000), and explore future trends, based on the four
   EURURALIS scenarios up to 2030.
   Data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) were used to classify
   farm types in 100 regions of the EU15, according to agricultural
   intensity. For the ten New Member States (EU10), which are not yet
   considered by the FADN, country level data were used to obtain similar
   farm types. Three processes were considered for the assessment of future
   trends in agricultural land-use intensity: (1) land-use change, (2)
   conversion into organic farming, and (3) changes in productivity of crop
   and grassland production.
   An ecosystem quality value was attributed to each farm type according to
   dose-effect relationships between pressure factors and biodiversity
   compared to the value for an undisturbed situation. The biodiversity in
   agricultural landscapes was then calculated as the average ecosystem
   quality multiplied by the relative area size of each farm type within a
   region. A similar method of attributing ecosystem quality values to
   other land-use types allowed comparison between different land-use
   types.
   Referring to the current situation, results indicate the lowest
   ecosystem quality values to be found in intensively used agricultural
   areas in lowlands (e.g. The Netherlands and northern France) and
   irrigation systems (e.g. Greece), whereas relatively high values are
   found in Spain and the New EU Member States. Scenario results show that
   for the A1 scenario (Global economy), the highest loss in ecosystem
   quality will take place in all regions in croplands and grasslands. The
   B2 scenario (Regional communities) provides the best opportunities to
   improve ecosystem quality of agricultural landscapes. In most scenarios,
   agricultural land is decreasing, while the remaining agricultural areas
   tend to be used more intensively. The negative impact of intensification
   on biodiversity is partly set off by (active or spontaneous) nature
   development on abandoned agricultural areas, but the overall trend seems
   to be generally negative.
   The strength of this methodology is that it provides a quick overview of
   land-use intensity change and biodiversity trends. Through the use of
   this farm-type level of analysis we have provided a good picture of the
   differences in land-use intensity and the related biodiversity between
   the EU regions and the scenarios. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Aim Africa is identified by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) as the least studied continent in terms of ecosystem
   dynamics and climate variability. The aim of this study was (1) to adapt
   the Lund-Postdam-Jena-GUESS (LPJ-GUESS) ecological modelling framework
   to Africa by providing new parameter values for tropical plant
   functional types (PFT), and (2) to assess the sensitivity of some
   African biomes to changes in precipitation regime.
   Location The study area was a representative transect (0-22 degrees N
   and 7-18 degrees E) through the transition from equatorial evergreen
   forests to savannas, steppes and desert northwards. The transect showed
   large latitudinal variation in precipitation (mean rainfall ranged from
   50 to 2300 mm year(-1)).
   Methods New PFT parameters used to calibrate LPJ-GUESS were based on
   modern pollen PFTs and remote sensed leaf area index (LAI). The model
   was validated using independent modern pollen assemblages, LAI and
   through comparison with White's modern potential vegetation map. Several
   scenarios were developed by combining changes in total rainfall amount
   with variation in the length of the dry season in order to test the
   sensitivity of African biomes.
   Results Simulated vegetation compared well to observed data at local and
   regional scales, in terms of ecosystem functioning (LAI), and
   composition (pollen and White's vegetation map). The assessment of the
   sensitivity of biomes to changes in precipitation showed that none of
   the ecosystems would shift towards a new type under the range of
   precipitation increases suggested by the IPCC (increases from 5 to
   20\%). However, deciduous and semi-deciduous forests may be very
   sensitive to small reductions in both the amount and seasonality of
   precipitation.
   Main conclusions This version of LPJ-GUESS parameterized for Africa
   simulated correctly the vegetation present over a wide precipitation
   gradient. The biome sensitivity assessment showed that, compared with
   savannas and grasslands, closed canopy forests may be more sensitive to
   change in precipitation regime due to the synergetic effects of changed
   rainfall amounts and seasonality on vegetation functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To propose a new approach to the small island effect (SIE) and a
   simple mathematical procedure for the estimation of its upper limit. The
   main feature of the SIE is that below an upper size threshold an
   increase of species number with increase of area in small islands is not
   observed.
   Location Species richness patterns from different taxa and insular
   systems are analysed.
   Methods Sixteen different data sets from 12 studies are analysed. Path
   analysis was used for the estimation of the upper limit of the SIE. We
   studied each data set in order to detect whether there was a certain
   island size under which the direct effects of area were eliminated. This
   detection was carried out through the sequential exclusion of islands
   from the largest to the smallest. For the cases where an SIE was
   detected, a log-log plot of species number against area is presented.
   The relationships between habitat diversity, species number and area are
   studied within the limits of the SIE. In previous studies only area was
   used for the detection of the SIE, whereas we also encompass habitat
   diversity, a parameter with well documented influence on species
   richness, especially at small scales.
   Results An SIE was detected in six out of the 16 studied cases. The
   upper limit of the SIE varies, depending on the characteristics of the
   taxon and the archipelago under study. In general, the values of the
   upper limit of the SIE calculated according to the approach undertaken
   in our study differ from the values calculated in previous studies.
   Main conclusions Although the classical species-area models have been
   used to estimate the upper limit of the SIE, we propose that the
   detection of this phenomenon should be undertaken independently from the
   species-area relationship, so that the net effects of area are
   calculated excluding the surrogate action of area on other variables,
   such as environmental heterogeneity. The SIE appears when and where area
   ceases to influence species richness directly. There are two distinct
   SIE patterns: (1) the classical SIE where both the direct and indirect
   effects of area are eliminated and (2) the cryptic SIE where area
   affects species richness indirectly. Our approach offers the opportunity
   of studying the different factors influencing biodiversity on small
   scales more accurately. The SIE cannot be considered a general pattern
   with fixed behaviour that can be described by the same model for
   different island groups and taxa. The SIE should be recognized as a
   genuine but idiosyncratic phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Univariate explanations of biodiversity have often failed to account for
   broad-scale patterns in species richness. As a result, increased
   attention has been paid to the development and testing of more synthetic
   multivariate hypotheses. One class of multivariate hypotheses, founded
   in successional diversity theory, predict that species richness is
   jointly influenced by periodic disturbances that create new niche
   opportunities in space or time, and the production of community biomass
   that speeds displacement of inferior by superior competitors.
   While the joint response of diversity to disturbance and productivity
   has gained support from theoretical and small-scale experimental
   studies, evidence that corresponding patterns of biodiversity occur
   broadly across natural systems is scarce.
   Using a data set that employed standardized methods to sample 85 streams
   throughout the mid-Atlantic United States of America, we show that
   biogeographical patterns of primary producer diversity in stream
   ecosystems are consistent with the predictions of a multivariate model
   that incorporates disturbance frequency and community biomass production
   as independent variables. Periphyton species richness is a concave-down
   function of disturbance frequency (mean no. floods year(-1)) and of
   biomass production (mu g of biomass accrual cm(-2) day(-1)), and an
   increasing function of their interaction.
   Changes in richness across the disturbance x productivity response
   surface can be related to several predicted life-history traits of the
   dominant species.
   Our findings complement prior studies by showing that multivariate
   models which consider interactive effects of community production and
   ecosystem disturbance are, in fact, candidate explanations of much
   broader patterns of richness in natural systems. Because multivariate
   models predict synergistic effects of ecological variables on species
   diversity, human activities - which are simultaneously altering both the
   disturbance regime and productivity of streams - could be influencing
   biodiversity more than previously anticipated.}},

Abstract = {{A prospective strategy is necessary to mitigate the negative impacts of
   habitat fragmentation in Germany. The traditional concept of protecting
   isolated remnants of endangered habitats as nature reserves could not
   stop the continuing decline of endangered species and the regional
   losses in biodiversity sufficiently. During the last century, different
   approaches to protect open space, species, and habitats have been
   developed. Based on a literature review, an analysis of the legal
   framework and a representative case study, this paper tries to
   characterise the development of greenways and habitat networks in
   Germany and to discuss the general possibilities and limitations in an
   European context. In Germany, greenways were first established to
   prevent urban sprawl, to separate settlements, to provide recreational
   opportunities and to improve air quality in industrialised urban areas.
   The increased relevance of nature conservation has led to the
   development of new types of habitat networks in addition to the greenway
   concept since 1980. Species-oriented habitat networks focus on the
   specific requirements of target species, while multifunctional habitat
   networks try to address many landscape functions when reconnecting the
   remnant habitats. The Kronsberg Project is an example of a local,
   multifunctional habitat network. It illustrates some of the
   implementation difficulties resulting from conflicting interests of the
   various user groups. In addition, the need became obvious to plan
   multifunctional networks which allow for spatial separation of
   conflicting site related objectives. The legal framework for habitat
   networks in Germany is, in principle, a sound legislation which requires
   that habitat networks cover a minimum of 10\% of the total land area of
   the German states. The conceptualisation of the networks must not be
   restricted to the boundaries of the individual German states because the
   networks should have an interstate character and also contribute to the
   European network of Natura 2000. However, this national and European
   network cannot be presently implemented by the German national
   authorities. Instead, the framework legislation must be passed as nature
   conservation laws at the state level, while concrete implementation
   takes place at the regional and local levels. There the implementation
   is hampered primarily by property ownership considerations or
   conflicting interests of landowners. This situation hinders the
   implementation of national and European objectives for habitat networks.
   In order to create a forward looking network strategy for Germany, more
   authority should be transferred to the national level. In addition, a
   stronger link between the scientific and conceptual basis of habitat
   networks is needed. Prioritising landscape functions and the selection
   of target species require better coordination. Economic incentives could
   be used to reduce the conflicts with landowners. Hopefully, a change in
   the EU-agricultural policy will facilitate this development. (c) 2004,

   historical harvests to understanding current patterns of abundance and

Abstract = {{Harvest records reveal that populations of bobcats (Lynx rufus) in New
   Hampshire have undergone substantial changes during the past 200 years.
   In the 1800s, a nearly continuous bounty program resulted in annual
   harvests that averaged similar to 30 bobcats. Harvests increased in
   1915, and fluctuated from 100 to 400 bobcats during the 1920s through
   the 1950s. In 1959, harvests peaked at 421 and then rapidly declined. By
   1970, payment was made on only 10 bobcats, and legal status was changed
   from nuisance animal to game species in 1973. In 1989, trapping and
   hunting seasons were closed and bobcats were designated a protected
   species. After 15 years of protection, populations of bobcats seem to be
   remaining at modest levels, To understand what factors may have
   contributed to the remarkable rise and fall of bobcat populations, we
   compared the temporal distribution of harvests to comments by early
   naturalists, legislation to control bobcat abundance, and historical
   changes in land use. We then used two approaches with a geographic
   information system to identify the environmental features that may
   affect present-day populations. The empirical approach relied on a
   comparison of landscape characteristics associated with recent
   (1990-2004) observations of bobcats to characteristics found at a
   comparable set of random locations. We also examined the characteristics
   of townships that yielded the majority of historical bobcat harvests
   (1931-1965) and developed a process-oriented model to rank present-day
   habitat suitability. The irruption of bobcat populations coincided with
   the availability of early-successional habitats as abandoned
   agricultural lands reverted to second-growth forests during the first
   half of the 20th century. Likewise, bobcat populations rapidly declined
   as these forests matured and no longer supported abundant prey,
   especially New England cottontails (Sylvilagus transitionalis). Our
   efforts to identify habitat features associated with present-day
   populations had mixed results. The empirically derived model correctly
   classified only 52\% of recent bobcat locations, whereas the
   process-oriented model indicated that nearly 88\% of recent bobcat
   observations were associated with sites that were ranked at high
   suitability. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of
   information on historical harvests when addressing questions on the
   status of contemporary wildlife populations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Non-native (alien, exotic) plant invasions are affecting ecological

   invasions, and the ecological processes which generate these patterns,

   with different mechanisms controlling global, regional and local
   dispersal. Patterns of invasion are rarely documented across multiple
   spatial scales, but research using multi-scale approaches has generated
   interesting new insights into the invasion process. The ecological
   effects of plant invasions are also scale-dependent, ranging from
   altered local community diversity and homogenization of the global

Title = {{The impact of exploiting grazers (scaridae) on the dynamics of Caribbean
   coral reefs}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{747-769}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Coral reefs provide a number of ecosystem services including coastal
   defense from storms, the generation of building materials, and
   fisheries. It is increasingly clear that the management of reef
   resources requires an ecosystem approach in which extractive activities
   are weighed against the needs of the ecosystem and its functions rather
   than solely those of the fishery. Here, I use a spatially explicit
   simulation model of a Caribbean coral reef to examine the ecosystem
   requirements for grazing which is primarily conducted by parrotfishes
   (Scaridae). The model allows the impact of fishing grazers to be
   assessed in the wider context of other ecosystem processes including
   coral-algal competition, hurricanes, and mass extinction of the
   herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum. Using a new analytical model of
   scarid grazing, it is estimated that parrotfishes can only maintain
   between 10\% and 30\% of a structurally complex forereef in a grazed
   state. Predictions from this grazing model were then incorporated into a
   broader simulation model of the ecosystem. Simulations predict that
   scarid grazing is unable to maintain high levels of coral cover (>=
   30\%) when severe hurricanes occur on a decadal basis, such as occurs in
   parts of the northern Caribbean. However, reefs can withstand such
   intense disturbance when grazing is undertaken by both scarids and the
   urchin Diadema. Scarid grazing is predicted to allow recovery from
   hurricanes when their incidence falls to 20 years or less (e.g., most of
   Central and South America). Sensitivity analyses revealed that scarid
   grazing had the most acute impact on model behavior, and depletion led
   to the emergence of a stable, algal-dominated community state. Under
   conditions of heavy grazer depletion, coral cover was predicted to
   decline rapidly from an initial level of 30\% to less than 1\% within 40
   years, even when hurricane frequency was low at 60 years. Depleted
   grazers caused a population bottleneck in juvenile corals in which algal
   overgrowth caused elevated levels of postsettlement mortality and
   resulted in a bimodal distribution of coral sizes. Several new
   hypotheses were generated including a region-wide change in the spatial
   heterogeneity of coral reefs following extinction of Diadema. The
   management of parrotfishes on Caribbean reefs is usually approached
   implicitly through no-take marine reserves. The model predicts that
   depletion of grazers in nonreserve areas can severely limit coral
   accretion. Other studies have shown that low coral accretion can reduce
   the structural complexity and therefore quality of the reef habitat for
   many organisms. A speculative yet rational inference from the model is
   that failure to manage scarid populations outside reserves will have a
   profoundly negative impact on the functioning of the reserve system and
   status of non-reserve reefs.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of vegetation and soil dynamics used to anticipate (or
   reverse) catastrophic transitions in arid and semi-arid rangelands are
   often difficult to interpret. This situation is due, in part, to a lack
   of empirically based conceptual models that incorporate the effects of
   multiple processes, scale, spatio-temporal pattern, and soils. Using
   observations of multi-temporal data from the Chihuahuan Desert, we
   describe a new approach to classifying vegetation dynamics based on
   multiple scales of vegetation and soil pattern as well as cross-scale
   interactions. We propose the existence of six types of mechanisms
   driving vegetation change including (1) stability, (2) size oscillation
   of plants, (3) loss and reestablishment of plants within functional
   groups, (4) loss of one plant functional group and replacement by
   another, (5) spatial reorganization of vegetation patches, and (6)
   cascading transitions that spread from small to broad scales. We provide
   evidence for the existence of these mechanisms, the species involved,
   and the geomorphic components on which they are observed in the
   Chihuahuan Desert. These mechanisms highlight the kinds of multi-scale
   observations that are needed to detect or interpret change and emphasize
   the importance of soil surface properties for interpreting vegetation
   change. The classification is potentially general across arid and
   semi-arid ecosystems and links spatial and temporal patterns in
   vegetation with ecological and geomorphic processes, monitoring, and
   restoration strategies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In 1994, the bacterial parasite Mycoplasma gallisepticum expanded its
   host range and swept through populations of a novel host - eastern US
   populations of the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus). This epizootic
   caused a dramatic decline in finch population numbers, has been shown to
   have caused strong selection on house finch morphology, and presumably
   caused evolutionary change at the molecular level as finches evolved
   enhanced resistance. As a first step toward identifying finch genes that
   respond to infection by Mycoplasma and which may have experienced
   natural selection by this parasite, we used suppression subtractive
   hybridization (SSH) and cDNA macroarray approaches to identify
   differentially expressed genes regulated by the Mycoplasma parasite. Two
   subtractive cDNA libraries consisting of 16 512 clones were developed
   from spleen using an experimentally uninfected bird as the `tester' and
   an infected bird as `driver', and vice versa. Two hundred and twenty
   cDNA clones corresponding 34 genes with known vertebrate homologues and
   a large number of novel transcripts were found to be qualitatively up-
   or down-regulated genes by high-density filter hybridization. These gene
   expression changes were further confirmed by a high throughout reverse
   Northern blot approach and in specific cases by targeted Northern
   analysis. BLAST searches show that heat shock protein (HSP) 90, MHC
   II-associated invariant chain (CD74), T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 1
   (TIM1), as well as numerous novel expressed genes not found in the
   databases were up- or down-regulated by the host in response to this

   environmental objectives between resource users and the general
   community is a key part of mobilizing the policy changes and public
   resources required to address major resource management challenges in
   Australia and elsewhere. Existing approaches to this issue have not been
   able to resolve a maladaptive stand-off between those emphasizing a
   `polluter pays' approach that imposes costs on resource users and a
   `beneficiary pays' approach which may privilege an unsustainable status
   quo.
   This paper outlines `the catchment care principle' advocated by the
   Wentworth Group {[}Wentworth Group, 2002. A New Model for Landscape
   Conservation in NSW. Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists Report to
   Premier Carr. WWF, Sydney, February, < www.wwf.org.au >], which states
   `that individual resource managers have an obligation to avoid land or
   natural resource management practices that harm the long-term interests
   of resource users as a whole'. The principle is interpreted as implying
   that resource management practices should not damage ecosystem
   integrity, while accepting that significant ecosystem modification might
   be consistent with maintaining a healthy working landscape.
   The paper also argues that the `catchment care' principle offers a
   principle-based approach that encourages burden sharing rather than a
   winner takes all political game, and is likely to enhance the ability of
   societies to craft constructive policy responses to some of our most
   difficult environmental challenges. In addition to encouuraging more
   adaptive governance and the protection of ecosystem integrity; the paper
   argues that the application of the catchment care principle provides a
   middle ground anchoring point for the political negotiation of policy
   changes. This is likely to encourage more socially efficient outcomes by
   reducing incentives to invest in economically unproductive lobbying
   activity and by encouraging political outcomes that diverge less from
   underlying social preferences. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The task of modeling the distribution of a large number of tree species
   under future climate scenarios presents unique challenges. First, the
   model must be robust enough to handle climate data outside the current
   range without producing unacceptable instability in the output. In
   addition, the technique should have automatic search mechanisms built in
   to select the most appropriate values for input model parameters for
   each species so that minimal effort is required when these parameters
   are fine-tuned for individual tree species. We evaluated four
   statistical models-Regression Tree Analysis (RTA), Bagging Trees (BT),
   Random Forests (RF), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines
   (MARS)-for predictive vegetation mapping under current and future
   climate scenarios according to the Canadian Climate Centre global
   circulation model. To test, we applied these techniques to four tree
   species common in the eastern United States: loblolly pine (Pinus
   taeda), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus
   grandifolia), and white oak (Quercus alba). When the four techniques
   were assessed with Kappa and fuzzy Kappa statistics, RF and BT were
   superior in reproducing current importance value (a measure of basal
   area in addition to abundance) distributions for the four tree species,
   as derived from approximately 100,000 USDA Forest Service's Forest
   Inventory and Analysis plots. Future estimates of suitable habitat after
   climate change were visually more reasonable with BT and RF, with
   slightly better performance by RF as assessed by Kappa statistics,
   correlation estimates, and spatial distribution of importance values.
   Although RTA did not perform as well as BT and RF, it provided
   interpretive models for species whose distributions were captured well
   by our current set of predictors. MARS was adequate for predicting
   current distributions but unacceptable for future climate. We consider
   RTA, BT, and RF modeling approaches, especially when used together to
   take advantage of their individual strengths, to be robust for

Abstract = {{Despite recent advances in resolving the scale issue, it remains
   problematic that so many ecological field studies are still conducted
   only at small scales because of the constraints imposed by limited
   resources. To maximize the use of these data, it would be helpful if the
   researchers could provide guidelines for the appropriate range and scale
   for the extrapolation of the data and identify the new information that
   would be needed to extend the scope of their extrapolation. In this
   paper, we present a method that can be used to detect scale thresholds
   for the extrapolation of field data through spatial analyses of the
   physical landscape, using the Fushan Forest, Taiwan, as an example.
   First, the relationship between the vegetation and the physical
   landscape was inferred from sample-plot data; this information was in
   turn used to extrapolate the data over the whole forest area. We then
   compared the environmental variables in the sample plots versus those in
   the whole forest area via principal component analysis, landscape
   classification, and spatial autocorrelation analysis. Analyses of the
   entire Fushan Forest area showed that there are at least three major
   spatial scales at which physical gradients are expressed: elevation at
   the scale of the full forest extent (more than 3,000 m), topographic
   position at 550 m, and aspect at 250 m. Analyses of the sample plots
   showed that the plots captured only two of these gradients-topographic
   position and aspect, but not elevation. Therefore, information from the
   current field data can only be extrapolated to within 550 m from the
   sample plots; further information derived from cross-elevation samples
   is needed to extrapolate beyond that range.}},

   disturbance. We observed a shift away from a tendency to lay unattached
   eggs at the water surface of the stream, reflecting the increasing
   likelihood of smothering by sediment, as well as increases in highly
   flexible and streamlined body shapes. Principal components and
   correspondence analyses involving species or trait composition all were
   able to discriminate landuse practises, but more of the overall
   between-landuse variance was accounted for by trait composition than
   species composition. All biological measures (species or trait
   composition) were correlated with both nutrient concentrations and
   sedimentation. Nutrient concentrations were better related to species
   and trait-category densities, whereas sedimentation was related to
   trait-category relative abundances. Overall, species traits successfully
   complemented traditional structural measures by helping to differentiate
   the consequences of landuse intensification in grassland stream
   communities. Rather than simply recording a loss or reduction of
   species, our functional approach was able to identify sensitive
   life-history characteristics linked to the functioning of ecosystems,
   thereby facilitating the development of targeted management actions.}},

Month = {{SPR}},
Abstract = {{The Northwest Forest Plan's 1994 Record of Decision (ROD) established a
   framework for a new ecosystem approach to federal land management across
   24 million acres of the Pacific Northwest. One strategy outlined in the
   ROD combined ecosystem management and civic involvement in the creation
   of planning provinces, consisting of 12 contiguous multi-ownership areas
   spanning the Plan region. The ROD also directed agencies to monitor the
   effectiveness of the Plan, including the implementation of a
   socioeconomic monitoring program. We defined communities within
   provinces in order to better understand socioeconomic change. We
   developed a composite measure of community socioeconomic well-being
   (SEWB) to compare communities within the 12 planning provinces based on
   their proximity to Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management
   (BLM) lands. Some provinces improved in SEWB over the decade and some
   declined, but this was not related to how much FS and BLM lands were in
   the province, nor how many communities in the province were close to FS
   and BLM lands. Communities within 5 miles of FS and BLM lands had
   significantly lower SEWB scores compared to communities farther away in
   both 1990 and 2000. Income inequality increased significantly between
   1990 and 2000 for communities within 5 miles of FS and BLM lands but
   showed no significant change for communities farther away. As existing
   jurisdictions that span multiple land ownerships with mechanisms for
   dialogue and learning among stakeholders and decisionmakers, planning
   provinces provide opportunities for increased understanding of the ways
   that forest management affects to community socioeconomic well-being.
   Information on socioeconomic conditions of communities in planning
   provinces is an important step in understanding how communities change
   and what factors contribute to change.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Minerotrophic sedge fens are common in sub-arctic regions and are a
   significant source of atmospheric methane (CH,), yet they have received
   less attention than other peatlands, such as boreal ombrotrophic bogs,
   which are smaller sources of CH4. At the process level, CH4 fluxes in
   sub-arctic systems are limited primarily by cold temperatures, and thus
   are sensitive to potential climate change. This study examined CH,
   dynamics in a temperate sedge-fen to determine controls on the spatial
   and temporal variability in CH4 fluxes and, therefore, how the
   biogeochemistry of CH4 in sedge-fen peatlands may respond to predicted
   changes in climate. We used flux chambers and laboratory peat
   incubations over a six to seven-year period (1994-2000) to study fluxes,
   pools, and potential production of CH4 in a peat-forming wetland in
   central New York State, USA. Results showed that precipitation (i.e.,
   dry years and depth to water table) exerted an important control on
   annual and seasonal patterns of CH4 fluxes. Mean summer flux rates
   ranged from 2258 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in the wettest year to -934 nmol m(-2)
   s(-1) (net consumption) in the driest year. CH4 concentrations in the
   surface peat were as low as 0.01 mu atm and as high as 10 matm in the
   summer months depending on precipitation patterns. In contrast, CH4
   concentrations were consistently two to three times greater in
   sub-surface than in surface peat, and pools persisted during dry years
   and were temporally less variable. Fluxes were only weakly associated
   with potential CH4 production rates, which showed little seasonal
   variation. In-vitro measurements of potential CH4 production did not
   sufficiently explain fluxes, suggesting a need for improved in-situ
   methods for measuring CH4 production. Site differences associated with
   different dominant vegetation had a significant effect on CH4 cycling in
   all years except the driest, suggesting sensitivity to vegetation
   changes. These results indicate that predicting responses of fen
   peatlands to environmental requires an improved understanding of the
   underlying microbial processes and mechanisms that control CH4 cycling.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining biodiversity requires a wise combination of protection,
   management and recreation of habitats to secure representative and
   functional habitat networks. As urbanisation is increasing worldwide.
   town and cities are becoming the most common habitat for humankind.
   Accordingly, the urban landscape is becoming increasingly important for
   maintaining biodiversity on site, as well as for understanding the
   concept of biodiversity in general, and its maintenance in urban
   landscapes.
   We evaluated the extent to which Swedish urban planners experience
   barriers when using comprehensive planning as a tool for the maintenance
   of biodiversity through the provision of sufficient quantity and quality
   of green space. All of the six large Swedish cities, having had constant
   relative population growth since the beginning of the 19th century were
   chosen as case studies. We first defined a normative model for planning
   urban biodiversity and operationalised this concept by using landscape
   ecological principles. Structured in-depth interviews were then carried
   out with three planners in each city. The respondents were asked about
   their interest, ability, and knowledge concerning planning for
   functional networks of green spaces in relation to the normative model.
   The in-depth interviews with 18 urban planners indicated that
   legislation was an important driver for green space planning that they
   paid attention to new knowledge concerning recreation values and public
   health, but that biodiversity maintenance was not a high priority. There
   was a general agreement that local governments lack necessary resources
   to plan for biodiversity. A majority of the respondents mentioned
   geographical information systems (GIS) as an important tool to integrate
   knowledge about biodiversity in the planning process, and to evaluate
   likely consequences caused by deviations from current structure plans
   related to an efficient use of urban green spaces to maintain
   biodiversity. However, an evaluation of the answers revealed that the
   respondents had actually overestimated their capacity to implement the
   normative model. To conclude, the unanimous view was that planners were
   interested in the maintenance of biodiversity, but were limited by
   knowledge and by personnel lacking suitable qualifications, as well as
   by inadequate organisations. Only a minority of the respondents thought
   that local governments should have resources for biodiversity
   conservation planning. Finally, we discuss how the implementation of
   biodiversity policies could be improved by better integration of natural
   and social sciences in education and policy implementation. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Soil carbon sequestration (SCS) has emerged as a technology with
   significant potential to help stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentrations
   and thus reduce the threat of global warming. Methods and models are
   needed to evaluate and recommend SCS practices based on their effects on
   carbon dynamics and environmental quality. Environment Policy Integrated
   Climate (EPIC) is a widely used and tested model for simulating many
   agroecosystem processes including plant growth, crop yield, tillage,
   wind and water erosion, runoff, soil density, and leaching. Here we
   describe new C and N modules developed in EPIC built on concepts from
   the Century model to connect the simulation of soil C dynamics to crop
   management, tillage methods, and erosion processes. The added C and N
   routines interact directly with soil moisture, temperature, erosion,
   tillage, soil density, leaching, and translocation functions in EPIC.
   Equations were also added to describe the effects of soil texture on
   soil C stabilization. Lignin concentration is modeled as a sigmoidal
   function of plant age. EPIC was tested against data from a conservation
   reserve program (CRP) 6-year experiment at five sites in three U.S.
   Great Plains states and a 61-year long-term agronomic experiment near
   Breton, Canada. Mean square deviations (MSD) calculated for CRP sites
   were less than 0.01 (kg C m(-2))(2), except for one site where it
   reached 0.025 (kg C m(-2))(2). MSD values in the 61-year experiment
   ranged between 0.047 and 0.077 (kg C m(-2))(2). The version of the EPIC
   model presented and tested here contains the necessary algorithms to
   simulate SCS and improve understanding of the interactions among soil
   erosion, C dynamics, and tillage. A strength of the model as tested is
   its ability to explain the variability in crop production, C inputs and
   SOC and N cycling over a wide range of soil, cropping and climatic
   conditions over periods from 6 to 61 years. For example, at the Breton
   site over 61 years, EPIC accounted for 69\% of the variability in grain
   yields, 89\% of the variability in C inputs and 91\% of the variability
   in SOC content in the top 15 cm. Continued development is needed in
   understanding why it overpredicts at low SOC and underpredicts at high
   SOC. Possibilities now exist to connect the C and N cycling parts of
   EPIC to algorithms to describe denitrification as driven by C metabolism
   and oxygen availability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Matrix population growth models are standard tools for forecasting
   population change and for managing rare species, but they are less
   useful for predicting extinction risk in the face of changing
   environmental conditions. Deterministic models provide point estimates
   of X, the finite rate of increase, as well as measures of matrix
   sensitivity and elasticity. Stationary matrix models can be used to
   estimate extinction risk in a variable environment, but they assume that
   the matrix elements are randomly sampled from a stationary (i.e.,
   non-changing) distribution. Here we outline a method for using
   nonstationary matrix model!; to construct realistic forecasts of
   population fluctuation in changing environments. Our method requires
   three pieces of data: (I) field estimates of transition matrix elements,
   (2) experimental data on the demographic responses of populations. to
   altered environmental conditions, and (3) forecasting data on
   environmental drivers. These three pieces of data are combined to
   generate a series of sequential transition matrices that emulate a
   pattern of long-term change in environmental drivers. Realistic
   estimates of population persistence and extinction risk can be derived
   from stochastic permutations of such a model. We illustrate the steps of
   this analysis with data from two population's of Sarracenia purpurea
   growing in northern New England. Sarracenia purpurea is a perennial
   carnivorous plant that is potentially at risk of local extinction
   because of increased nitrogen deposition. Long-term monitoring records
   or models of environmental change can be used to generate time series of
   driver variables under different scenarios of changing environments.
   Both manipulative and natural experiments can be used to construct a
   linking function that describes how matrix parameters change as a
   function of the environmental driver. This synthetic modeling approach
   provides quantitative estimates of extinction probability that have an
   explicit mechanistic basis.}},

Journal = {{COMMUNITY ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{53-67}},
Abstract = {{Palynological records helped to illuminate the past, but we show the
   take can be made much sharper when statistical analysis recognises the
   records' scale dependence. The latter is an unavoidable consequence of
   site selection, sediment sampling, and the samples' arrangement into
   time series by dating. To make provision for this in statistical
   analysis, scale has to be incorporated as one of the intrinsic
   variables. But by incorporating scale, the analysis will render the
   outcome not to be a single conclusion, the usual case in conventional
   statistics, but a multitude of conclusions each regarding the same set
   of response and forcing variables and each as valid at its own scale as
   any of the other conclusions at theirs. Thus, the central question for a
   usable Statistics is this: how to incorporate scale into the analysis
   and still have a unique conclusion. We address the methodological
   aspects and illustrate them by worked examples. We use 14 sites
   scattered across the globe. Interestingly, the analysis of these brought
   forth hitherto hidden aspects of the temporal synchronicity of change in
   palynological composition and concomitant atmospheric temperature
   oscillations that should greatly interest Ecology, as one critique put
   it, in the age of Global Change. The examples testify to a conceptual
   advance in laying open a very basic principle: the synchronicity's
   statistically strong formation specificity, dominantly positive (in
   frequency terms) for climate warming at sites in the currently humid,
   micro- and mesothermal zones, and negative in the currently and and
   semi-arid zones. Our paper begins with an introduction to the
   terminology, of multiscale analysis in Ecology, followed by data
   sources, the method we call canonical serial scaling, and objectives. A
   detailed discussion of data properties with special attention to error
   sources in palynology is provided. The method components discussed
   include the scalars of compositional transition and synchronicity, error
   dampening, stabilisation of the synchronicity scalar and its sign
   distribution, analysis of time shifted series, the use of deviation
   graphs, and pointers to help detect hotspots and other characteristic
   points of change on the time axis.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recent phylogenetic evidence suggests that the extraordinary diversity
   of the Cape Floristic Kingdom in South Africa may be the result of
   widespread evolutionary radiation. Our understanding of the role of
   adaptive versus neutral processes in these radiations remains largely
   Speculative. In this Study we investigated factors involved in the
   diversification of Argyroderma, a genus within the most spectacular of
   the Cape radiations, that of the Ruschioid subfamily of the Aizoaceae.
   We used amplified fragment length polymorphisms and a suite of
   morphological traits to elucidate patterns of differentiation within and
   between species of Argyroderma across the range of the genus. We then
   used a matrix correlation approach to assess the influence of landscape
   structure, edaphic gradients, and flowering phenology on phenotypic and
   neutral genetic divergence in the system. We found evidence for strong
   spatial genetic isolation at all taxonomic levels. In addition, genetic
   differentiation occurs along a temporal axis, between sympatric species
   with divergent flowering times. Morphological differentiation, which
   previous studies suggest is adaptive, occurs along a habitat axis,
   between populations occupying different edaphic microenvironments.
   Morphological differentiation is in turn significantly associated with
   flowering time shifts. Thus we propose that diversification within
   Argyroderma has occurred through a process of adaptive speciation in
   allopatry. Spatially isolated populations diverge phenotypically in
   response to divergent habitat selection, which in turn leads to the
   evolution of reproductive isolation through divergence of flowering
   phenologies, perhaps as a correlated response to morphological
   divergence. Evidence suggests that diversification of the group has
   proceeded in two phases: the first involving divergence of allopatric
   taxa on varied microhabitats within a novel habitat type (the quartz
   gravel plains), and the second involving range expansion of an early
   flowering phenotype on the most extreme edaphic habitat and subsequent
   incomplete differentiation of allopatric Populations of the early
   flowering group. These results point to adaptive speciation in allopatry
   as a likely model for the spectacular diversification of the ice-plant
   family in the dissected landscapes of the southern African winter
   rainfall deserts.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{64-79}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Ecosystems have higher-order emerging properties that can affect the
   conservation of species. We identify some of these properties in order
   to facilitate a better understanding of them.
   2. Nonlinear, indirect effects of food web interactions among species
   can produce counterintuitive changes in populations.
   3. Species differ in their roles and linkages with other species in the
   system. These roles are a property of the system. Such differences in
   roles influence how we conserve individual species.
   4. Ecosystems operate at a multitude of interacting spatial and temporal
   scales, which together structure the system and affect the dynamics of
   individual populations.
   5. Disturbance also structures an ecosystem, producing both long-term
   slow changes and sudden shifts in ecosystem dynamics.
   6. Ecosystems therefore can have multiple states, determined both by
   disturbance regimes and biotic interactions. Conservation should
   recognize a possible multiplicity of natural states while avoiding
   aberrant (human-induced) states.
   7. Ecosystem processes are influenced by the composition of the biota
   they contain. Disturbances to the biota can distort processes and
   functions, which in turn can endanger individual species.
   8. The goal of ecosystem conservation is the long-term persistence of
   the biota in the system. There are two paradigms: community-based
   conservation (CBC) and protected area conservation. Both have their
   advantages but neither is sufficient to protect the biota on its own.
   9. CBC is required to conserve the majority of the world's biota not
   included in protected areas. However, current CBC methods favour a few
   idiosyncratic species, distort the species complex, and ignore the
   majority. More comprehensive methods are required for this approach to
   meet the goal of ecosystem conservation.
   10. Protected areas are essential to conserve species unable to coexist
   with humans. They also function as ecological baselines to monitor the
   effects of humans on their own ecosystems.
   11. However, protected areas suffer from loss of habitat through
   attrition of critical areas. Thus, renewal (addition) of habitat is
   required in order to achieve the long-term persistence of biota in
   functioning ecosystems. Identification of minimum habitat areas and
   restoration of ecosystems become two major priorities for future
   research.}},

   uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania: lessons to learn towards moving from
   monotherapy to fixed combination therapy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Malaria is a leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa. Tanzania
   changed its malaria treatment policy from chloroquine (CQ) to
   Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) as first line drug in August 2001. We
   wanted to assess the perception and behaviour about SP after phasing out
   chloroquine which was very popular, cheap, available, and was preferred
   by many people for self-medication in homes as it was considered to have
   minimal side effects.
   Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were carried out after one year of the
   anti-malarial drug treatment policy change in the country. The FGD
   themes were on malaria for under-five children and other age groups,
   anti-malarial drug use through self-medications, specific experiences
   people had about SP drug for both mothers/guardians, men in the
   communities and health workers. A total of twelve FGDs were performed
   with mothers/guardians, men and health workers in the selected public
   health care facilities in the district.
   In the FGDs people feared adverse reactions from SP; its slow ability of
   reducing fever and self-treatment in this case was less reported from
   the mothers/guardians groups. However, SP was reported by health workers
   to be administered using the direct observation approach under
   supervision in their health care facilities. This was done in order to
   increase compliance as there were worries that some mothers were
   throwing away the drug if they were instructed by health workers to go
   and administer SP to their sick children at home.
   Based on this information, it is obvious that fear and negative
   perceptions about SP drug was common in the study setting. As evidence
   of this, there was less reported home-stocking and self-medication in
   the discussions for this particular recommended new first-line
   anti-malarial. The public has demonstrated a lack of confidence in SP.
   Furthermore, some health workers expressed obvious fear and negative
   perceptions towards the drug despite the fact that some FGDs with health

   Such negative perception towards SP highlights the need to start earlier
   sensitization and educational campaigns to the rural communities for a
   new drug program to ensure its success. Messages should clearly state
   what should be expected from the new drug (Coartem), before its
   introduction. This is important especially as Tanzania is expected to
   move towards the expensive but efficacious and effective
   fixed-combination (Coartem) anti-malarial therapy early next year

Abstract = {{Geometric morphometric methods were used to investigate shape variation
   in the neuropodial chaetae (uncini) of the polychaete genus Polycirrus
   (Terebellidae: Polycirrinae). Illustrations of 82 uncini from 47
   specimens/taxa (one to three uncini per specimen/taxon) were digitized
   and 10 landmarks, representing putatively homologous points, were
   identified on the outline of each uncinus. Two distinct types of uncini
   were identified and described graphically using a Principal Component
   technique (Relative Warps Analysis) and non-metric ordination
   (multi-dimensional scaling). Type 1 uncini with a short occipitium and
   flat base and Type 2 with a long occipitium and arched base represent
   states of a new character available for future phylogenetic studies of
   the group. The shape of the uncini alone subdivided the genus into two
   groups, one containing 14 taxa and another with 33 taxa. The type of
   uncini correlated well with the presence of long pinnate notochaetae and
   the last occurrence of notopodia, enabling further subdivision of the
   genus into four provisional groups; a key is provided to distinguish the
   groups. The landmarks identified on the surface of Polycirrus uncini are
   considered homologous with those on the uncini of other Terebellidae and
   therefore landmark-based geometric morphometrics could be applied to
   investigate shape changes in other uncini-bearing Terebellidae.}},

   motivation and evaluation methods}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{70}},

Pages = {{347-357}},
Abstract = {{Applications of logistic regression in a used-unused design in wildlife
   habitat studies often suffer from asymmetry of errors: used resource
   units (landscape locations) are known with certainty, whereas unused
   resource units might be observed to be used with greater sampling
   intensity. More appropriate might be to use logistic regression to
   estimate a resource selection function (RSF) tied to a use-availability
   design based on independent samples drawn from used and available
   resource units. We review the theoretical motivation for RSFs and show
   that sample ``contamination{''} and the exponential form commonly
   assumed for the RSF are not concerns, contrary to recent statements by
   Keating and Cherry (2004; Use and interpretation of logistic regression
   in habitat-selection studies. Journal of Wildlife Management
   68:774-789). To do this, we re-derive the use-availability likelihood
   and show that it can be maximized by logistic regression software. We
   then consider 2 case studies that illustrate our findings. For our first
   case study, we fit both RSFs and resource selection probability
   functions (RSPF) to point count data for 4 bird species with varying
   levels of occurrence among sample blocks. Drawing on our new derivation
   of the likelihood, we sample available resource units with replacement
   and assume overlapping distributions of used and available resource
   units. Irrespective of overlap, we observed approximate proportionality
   between predictions of a RSF and RSPF. For our second case study, we
   evaluate the classic use-availability design suggested by Manly et al.
   (2002), where availability is sampled without replacement, and we
   systematically introduce contamination to a sample of available units
   applied to RSFs for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou).
   Although contamination appeared to reduce the magnitude of one RSF beta
   coefficient, change in magnitude exceeded sampling variation only when >
   20\% of the available units were confirmed caribou use locations (i.e.,
   contaminated). These empirically based simulations suggest that
   previously recommended sampling designs are robust to contamination. We
   conclude with a new validation method for evaluating predictive
   performance of a RSF and for assessing if the model deviates from being
   proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit.}},

Title = {{Trophic functioning with parasites: a new insight for ecosystem analysis}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{320}},
Pages = {{43-53}},
Abstract = {{Several balance models of a coral reef ecosystem were created to
   determine if neglecting parasites significantly alters quantitative or
   qualitative ecosystem analysis. To better understand how these models
   react to the addition of parasites: (1) separate and joint analyses of
   parasitism in fish and benthos compartments were done, (2) it was
   assumed that parasites have predators or parasites, (3) the quantitative
   differences in parasites were evaluated and (4) microfauna were
   introduced into the models. From a quantitative view point the results
   were mixed; neglecting parasites seemed to cause small changes in
   conditions in some models. Qualitative differences were quite notable.
   Inclusion of parasites radically increased the number of pathways in the
   coral reef ecosystem model (from 362 to 7391), and increased mean
   trophic efficiency of the system (from 5.2 to 7.7 \%), resulting in a
   longer food chain (from V to VIII). Evaluation of quantitative
   differences in parasites showed that the models are very sensitive to
   parasite biomass, which varied from 0.60 to 0.0 6 g m(-2). It is
   concluded that, even though introduction of parasites may not
   significantly change total flow of the modelled system, their omission
   may lead to high inaccuracy in web patterns (i.e. pathways) and trophic
   structure (i.e. trophic efficiency). Our results are similar to those
   from other studies of food webs and parasites that used different

Pages = {{43-54}},
Abstract = {{The response of a deep, cold-water benthic community to physical
   disturbance from offshore drilling was investigated using Remotely
   Operated Vehicle (ROV) video in the Faroe-Shetland Channel. This study
   presents a novel method for characterising changes in the ecosystem
   function of deep-water benthic megafaunal communities in response to
   physical disturbance. Ecosystem function is investigated using a range
   of community parameters, particularly abundance and diversity. High
   levels of physical disturbance, characterised by smothering of the
   seabed within a radius of 50 to 120 m around the drilling site, resulted
   in significant but variable reductions in megafaunal abundance (up to
   92.3\%). Reductions in diversity, particularly in species richness, were
   apparent between disturbed (Mao Tao estimated species richness of
   ES(500) = 12.9) and undisturbed areas (ES(500) = 20.6). The implications
   of selective removal of taxa on ecosystem function and recovery are
   discussed. Low level disturbance had comparatively little effect on the
   megafaunal communities; the effects varied in nature depending on
   motility and functional group (e.g. motile scavenger abundances were
   maximal at intermediate distances from disturbance). We conclude by
   comparing the functioning of the ecosystem under different regimes of

Abstract = {{Research on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem

   at the landscape scales in which society is interested will be extremely
   challenging. Novel approaches, such as the BioMERGE (Biotic Mechanisms

Abstract = {{The brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) is an endangered
   species in southeastern Australia and many of the remaining populations
   are declining. The steep rocky habitat and shy nature of the species
   make it difficult to obtain data on population parameters such as
   abundance and recruitment. Faecal pellet counts from scat plots are
   commonly used to monitor population trends but these are imprecise and
   difficult to relate to absolute population size. We conducted a
   noninvasive genetic sampling `mark-recapture' study over a 2-year period
   to identify individuals from faecal DNA samples and estimate the
   population size of four brush-tailed rock-wallaby colonies located in
   Wollemi National Park, New South Wales. Scat plots in rock-wallaby
   colonies were used as sample collection points for this study. Two
   separate population estimates were carried out for three of the colonies
   to determine if we could detect recruitment and changes in population
   size. We determined that there was one large colony of an estimated 67
   individuals (95\% confidence interval: 55-91) and three smaller
   colonies. Monitoring of the smaller colonies also detected possible
   population size increases in all three. Our results indicate that faecal
   DNA analysis may be a promising method for estimating and monitoring
   population trends in this species particularly when used with a
   traditional field survey method.}},

Abstract = {{In most regions of the world removal of environmental stress facilitates
   regeneration of native plants and habitats. However, in many of New
   Zealand's modified landscapes, exotic species are likely to respond
   first to any reduction in stress because these fast-growing species are
   prevalent in local vegetation and dominate seed banks. Given the trend
   in agriculture towards intensive management on larger units, the
   indigenous character in New Zealand landscapes is being marginalised and
   there is the risk that further reduction in visibility of native
   vegetation may be perpetuated by a growing familiarity and
   identification with ubiquitous exotic species. Alternative landscapes,
   based on an understanding of ecosystem processes, need to be explored if
   biodiversity coals set by international convention and national resource
   management law are to be achieved. This study provides a set of
   predictions and pathways, backed by field observations, to underpin a
   restoration strategy at patch to landscape scales. A forest model,
   LINKNZ, is employed to simulate species succession under New Zealand
   conditions. The incorporation of disturbance regimes and species
   dispersal processes in the model permits a wide range of scenarios to be
   investigated encompassing indigenous forest development, exotic species
   interactions with indigenous forest ecosystems, management of mixed
   introduced-indigenous forests, and landscape dynamics. The results
   illustrate an approach that identifies potential biosecurity threats and
   provides additional options for integrating nature and production in New
   Zealand's rural and urban landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable estimates of diets are vital to monitor impacts of sea lion
   populations on their ecosystems and their interactions with fisheries,
   and to understand the role of food to animal nutrition and health.
   Approaches include using (1) prey remnants in stomach contents, spews
   and scats; (2) prey DNA in scats; (3) fatty acid signatures in blubber;
   and (4) stable isotope ratios in predator's tissue. Each methodology has
   particular advantages and limitations, many of which can be assessed and
   improved through controlled captive feeding trials. Analysis of prey
   remnants from captive sea lion scats have shown significant variability
   in digestion between and within prey species, which, coupled with
   preferential regurgitation and enumeration biases, can confound accurate
   diet quantification, but does not prevent spatial or temporal
   comparisons. Correction for partial digestion and use of additional
   structures besides otoliths can provide reliable prey size estimates.
   Prey DNA can be consistently isolated from soft remains in scats from
   captive sea lions, and with further development this approach may allow
   quantification of diet. Genetic methods can be expensive and
   representative of only one to two days foraging (like prey remnant
   analysis), but may be less affected by differential digestion and can
   identify prey in scats that could not be identified through structural
   remnants. Validation of fatty acid signature analysis to quantify diet
   at longer temporal scales in sea lions is ongoing. This new technique
   promises to be particularly useful to assess biases in traditional
   methods, identify the onset of weaning, and highlight the prey that most
   contribute to lipid reserves. Stable isotope analysis of predator
   tissues gives only trophic level data, but can provide data on diet
   changes on many temporal scales. Remote video monitoring of foraging
   events and lavage/enema techniques can provide valuable diet
   information, but, like many newer techniques, animal capture is
   required. Ideally a suite of techniques should be used to study diet.
   While methods and correction factors developed for Steller sea lions can
   likely be applied to the other five sea lion species, they should be
   verified experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{The Australian Grains Industry is an exciting world to be part of. Our
   producers are considered world leaders for their innovation and ability
   to implement change yet more opportunities need to be taken to support
   our rural leaders. The field of precision agriculture (spatial
   management) has created huge interest in recent years, however many
   farmers are struggling to understand how it can benefit their system.
   There is no point in having technology for technology's sake. The advent
   of new technology and the bogus claims by snake oil merchants (e.g.
   people who are trying to sell unsuitable products) are leading the
   industry astray. Therefore we need to support our growers who are coming
   to grips with the many emerging techniques.
   Management systems such as raised bed and controlled traffic farming
   have in many cases altered the need for managing spatial variability. We
   need to get the basics right, in order to understand how technology can
   be utilised.
   Harvesting moisture and sunlight is what drives the cropping system. Our
   leading producers understand how their management affects these basic
   principles.
   This paper will discuss how Department of Primary Industries (DPI)
   grains team members are supporting cropping systems through
   participatory action research, young and young at heart farmer groups
   and other alternate support methods.

Abstract = {{Soil structure of agricultural fields is generally heterogeneous because
   the mechanical stresses applied to the soil during tillage and traffic
   do not affect the whole soil volume. Soil structure is usually
   characterized physically by destructive methods such as bulk density,
   penetration resistance or from the visual morphological description of a
   soil profile. Our research aimed at analysing the ability of a non
   destructive method based on electrical resistivity measurement to
   describe the structure of a cultivated soil. Experiments have been
   conducted on a Haplic Luvisol developped on loess material.
   A laboratory investigation was completed to study the resistivity
   changes induced by compaction (1.1 to 1.7 g.cm(3)) and water content
   changes (0.10 to 0.24 g.g(-1)). Electrical resistivity depended
   significantly on the physical state of the soil (from 20 up to 120
   Ohm.m). Resistivity decreased with increased density. The lower the
   water content the greater the decrease in resistivity. The soil
   electrical resistivity was then measured in the field with 2D Wenner
   configuration using an inter-electrode spacing of 0.10 m along a 3.20 m
   transect. Comparisons between inverted electrical resistivity maps and
   visual morphological descriptions showed the ability of electrical
   resistivity to detect wheels tracks. Interpretation of electrical
   surveying in a heterogeneous field after ploughing was more difficult
   and would probably be possible only by a 3D investigation.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},

Pages = {{1-68}},
Abstract = {{During the past 2 decades, the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) population in
   the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) has increased in numbers and
   expanded in range. Understanding temporal, environmental, and spatial
   variables responsible for this change is useful in evaluating what
   likely influenced grizzly bear demographics in the GYE and where future
   management efforts might benefit conservation and management. We used
   recent data from radio-marked bears to estimate reproduction (1983-2002)
   and survival (1983-2001); these we combined into models to evaluate
   demographic vigor (lambda {[}gimel]). We explored the influence of an
   array of individual, temporal, and spatial covariates on demographic
   vigor.
   We identified an important relationship between gimel and where a bear
   resides within the GYE. This potential for a source-sink dynamic in the
   GYE, coupled with concerns for managing sustainable mortality, reshaped
   our thinking about how management agencies might approach longterm
   conservation of the species. Consequently, we assessed the current
   spatial dynamic of the GYE grizzly bear population. Throughout, we
   followed the information-theoretic approach. We developed suites of a
   priori models that included individual, temporal, and spatial covariates
   that potentially affected reproduction and survival. We selected our
   best approximating models using Akaike's information criterion (AlC)
   adjusted for small sample sizes and overdispersion (AlCc or QAIC(c),
   respectively).
   We provide recent estimates for reproductive parameters of grizzly bears
   based on 108 adult (> 3 years old) females observed for 329 bear-years.
   We documented production of 104 litters with cub counts for 102 litters.
   Mean age of females producing their first litter was 5.81 years and
   ranged from 4 to 7 years. Proportion of nulliparous females that
   produced cubs at age 4-7 years was 9.8, 29.4, 56.4, and 100\%,
   respectively. Mean ( SE) litter size (n = 102) was 2.0 +/- 0.1. The
   proportion of litters of 1, 2, and 3 cubs was 0.18, 0.61, and 0.22,
   respectively. Mean yearling litter size (n = 57) was 2.0 +/- 0.1. The
   proportion of litters containing 1, 2, 3, and 4 yearlings was 0.26,
   0.51, 0.21, and 0.02, respectively. The proportion of radio-marked
   females accompanied by cubs varied among years from 0.05 to 0.60; the
   mean was 0.316 +/- 0.03. Reproductive rate was estimated as 0.318 female
   cubs/female/year. We evaluated the probability of producing a litter of
   0-3 cubs relative to a suite of individual and temporal covariates using
   multinomial logistic regression. Our best models indicated that
   reproductive output, measured as cubs per litter, was most strongly
   influenced by indices of population size and whitebark pine (Pinus
   albicaulis) cone production. Our data suggest a possible density-de
   pendent response in reproductive output, although perinatal mortality
   could have accounted for the correlation.
   We analyzed survival of cubs and yearlings using radiotelemetry of 49
   unique female bears observed with 65 litters containing 137 dependent
   young. We documented 42 deaths: 32 cubs, 5 yearlings, and 5 that could
   have died as a cub or yearling. Using a nest survival estimator coded in
   Program MARK, our best model indicated that cub and yearling survival
   were most affected by residency in the GYE. Survival was highest for
   cubs and yearlings living outside Yellowstone National Park (YNP) but
   within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Grizzly Bear Recovery
   Zone (RZ). Cubs and yearlings living inside YNP had lower survival
   rates, and those living outside the RZ had the lowest survival rates.
   Survival rates were negatively related to a population index, suggesting
   density dependence. Survival improved with higher whitebark pine seed
   production, greater winter severity, larger litter size, and higher
   female (mother's) age. We tested theories of sexually selective
   infanticide, but results were equivocal.
   We investigated factors influencing survival of subadult and adult
   grizzly bears using data from 323 radio-marked bears monitored for 5,989
   months. Telemetry records were converted into monthly encounter
   histories, and survival was estimated using known fate data type in
   Program MARK. Bears were grouped into a study sample and conflict (bears
   specifically trapped because of conflict with humans) sample according
   to circumstance of capture and monitoring, with data from both
   contributing to survival estimates. A censored (C) data set included 69
   documented mortalities but censored 22 bears with unknown fate. A
   second, assumed dead (AD), data set considered these 22 bears as
   mortalities.
   Most known mortalities (85.5\%) were human caused, with 26 and 43 from
   the study and conflict samples, respectively. Mean annual survival, (S)
   over bar (CF), for study sample female bears using C and AD data sets
   were (S) over bar (CF)=0.950 (95\% Cl = 0.898-0.976) and (S) over bar
   (AD F) = 0.922 (95\% CI = 0.857-0.995). Process standard deviation (SD)
   for study sample female bears was estimated at SDC = 0.013 and SDAD =
   0.034. Our best models indicated that study sample bears survived better
   than conflict sample bears, females survived better than males, survival
   was lowest during autumn, and survival increased during years with good
   whitebark pinecone production. Bears with a higher proportion of annual
   locations outside the RZ exhibited poorer survival than individuals
   located more frequently inside YNP, the RZ, or both. Indices of winter
   severity, ungulate biomass, and population size, plus individual
   covariates, including presence of dependent young, prior conflicts with
   humans, and age class, were not important predictors of survival in our
   models. We documented a trend of increased survival through the study
   that was offset in recent years by lower survival of bears located more
   frequently outside the RZ. This result suggests that efforts to reduce
   female mortality initiated in 1983 were successful, and similar measures
   outside the RZ would improve the prospect for continued growth and
   expansion of the GYE grizzly bear population.
   To estimate sustainable mortality of the population, we produced
   trajectories of the GYE grizzly bear population under a range of
   survival rates of independent females (> 2 years old) using an
   individual-based, stochastic simulation program and demographic data
   from radio-marked bears. We incorporated yearly (process) variation in
   survival rates as estimated from data after removing sampling variation.
   We summarized trajectories by mean gimel and by probability of gimel >
   1, both within a 10-year period, and examined sensitivity of results by
   altering our initial assumptions to reflect uncertainty. Because process
   variation of female survival was low, gimel decreased stochastically
   only slightly from that expected under a completely deterministic model.
   Uncertainty about mean cub and yearling survival rates was considerable,
   but because, was relatively insensitive to these parameters,
   incorporating this uncertainty also lowered resulting trajectories only
   slightly. Uncertainty about independent female survival had a much
   larger effect on probability of population decline despite having little
   effect on expected gimel. Under our current understanding of the GYE
   grizzly bear population dynamics, gimel was independent of male survival
   rate; variation in male mortality produced only short-term effects on
   abundance and long-term effects on sex ratio. The appropriate mortality
   target for independent female bears depends on the risk of a population
   decline (i.e., gimel > 1) that managers and the public are willing to
   accept. For the chance of a population decline to be <= 5\% under
   conditions applying during 1983-2002, annual mortality of independent
   females would have to be <= 10\%. Projections are useful only if viewed
   over a relatively short time frame because they were based solely on
   mean 1983-2002 conditions and because small samples make it difficult
   for managers to know the true mortality rate.
   To further explore the implications of geographic structure in female
   survival, we built an array of deterministic models using estimates of
   reproduction and survival from our best models. We calculated
   deterministic estimates of, incorporating our residency covariate plus
   changes in whitebark pinecone production and winter severity. A
   source-sink dynamic is suggested for the GYE, with gimel >= 1 inside YNP
   and the RZ but, < 1 outside the RZ. Such a source-sink dynamic requires
   new discussions about population management, mortality thresholds, and
   elimination of anthropogenic foods on the edge of the ecosystem. To
   enhance future management, we present food and population monitoring
   guidelines that should be considered in light of our findings.}},

Abstract = {{A longitudinal capture-mark-recapture study was conducted to determine
   the temporal dynamics of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) in a European
   rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) population of low to moderate density on
   sand-hill country in the lower North Island of New Zealand. A
   combination of sampling ( trapping and radio-tracking) and diagnostic
   (cELISA, PCR and isotype ELISA) methods was employed to obtain data
   weekly from May 1998 until June 2001. Although rabbit haemorrhagic
   disease virus ( RHDV) infection was detected in the study population in
   all 3 years, disease epidemics were evident only in the late summer or
   autumn months in 1999 and 2001. Overall, 20\% of 385 samples obtained
   from adult animals older than 11 weeks were seropositive. An RHD
   outbreak in 1999 contributed to an estimated population decline of 26\%.
   A second RHD epidemic in February 2001 was associated with a population
   decline of 52\% over the subsequent month. Following the outbreaks, the
   seroprevalence in adult survivors was between 40\% and 50\%. During
   2000, no deaths from RHDV were confirmed and mortalities were
   predominantly attributed to predation. Influx of seronegative immigrants
   was greatest in the 1999 and 2001 breeding seasons, and preceded the RHD
   epidemics in those years. Our data suggest that RHD epidemics require
   the population immunity level to fall below a threshold where
   propagation of infection can be maintained through the population.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use and land-cover change research increasingly takes the form of
   integrated land-change science. the explicit joining of ecological,

   programming. cellular modeling and agent-based modeling - are applied to
   land change in the Southern Yucatan Peninsular Region (SYPR) of Mexico
   through the SYPR Integrated Assessment (SYPRIA). This work illustrates
   how computational intelligence techniques, such as genetic programming,
   can be used to model decision making in the context of human-environment
   relationships. This application also contributes to methodological
   innovations in multicriteria evaluation and modeling of coupled
   human-environment systems. This effort also demonstrates the importance
   of considering both social and environmental drivers of land change,

   the context of key socioeconomic and political drivers, particularly as
   channelled through market institutions and land tenure, and ecological
   factors, especially characteristics of land-use and land-cover such as

Abstract = {{Predicting the probability of successful establishment of plant species
   by matching climatic variables has considerable potential for
   incorporation in early warning systems for the management of biological
   invasions. We select South Africa as a model source area of invasions
   worldwide because it is an important exporter of plant species to other
   parts of the world because of the huge international demand for
   indigenous flora from this biodiversity hotspot. We first mapped the
   five ecoregions that occur both in South Africa and other parts of the
   world, but the very coarse definition of the ecoregions led to
   unreliable results in terms of predicting invasible areas. We then
   determined the bioclimatic features of South Africa's major terrestrial
   biomes and projected the potential distribution of analogous areas
   throughout the world. This approach is much more powerful, but depends
   strongly on how particular biomes are defined in donor countries.
   Finally, we developed bioclimatic niche models for 96 plant taxa
   (species and subspecies) endemic to South Africa and invasive elsewhere,
   and projected these globally after successfully evaluating model
   projections specifically for three well-known invasive species
   (Carpobrotus edulis, Senecio glastifolius, Vellereophyton dealbatum) in
   different target areas. Cumulative probabilities of climatic suitability
   show that high-risk regions are spatially limited globally but that
   these closely match hotspots of plant biodiversity. These probabilities
   are significantly correlated with the number of recorded invasive
   species from South Africa in natural areas, emphasizing the pivotal role
   of climate in defining invasion potential. Accounting for potential
   transfer vectors (trade and tourism) significantly adds to the
   explanatory power of climate suitability as an index of invasibility.
   The close match that we found between the climatic component of the
   ecological habitat suitability and the current pattern of occurrence of
   South Africa alien species in other parts of the world is encouraging.
   If species' distribution data in the donor country are available,
   climatic niche modelling offers a powerful tool for efficient and
   unbiased first-step screening. Given that eradication of an established
   invasive species is extremely difficult and expensive, areas identified
   as potential new sites should be monitored and quarantine measures
   should be adopted.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the role of echolocation and other sensory cues in two small
   frugivorous New World leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae: Artibeus watsoni
   and Vampyressa pusilla) feeding on different types of fig fruit. To test
   which cues the bats need to find these fruit, we conducted behavioral
   experiments in a flight cage with ripe and similar-sized figs where we
   selectively excluded vision, olfaction, and echolocation cues from the
   bats. In another series of experiments, we tested the discrimination
   abilities of the bats and presented sets of fruits that differed in
   ripeness (ripe, unripe), size (small, large), and quality
   (intact/infested with caterpillars). We monitored the bats' foraging and
   echolocation behavior simultaneously. In flight, both bat species
   continuously emitted short (< 2 ms), multi-harmonic, and steep
   frequency-modulated (FM) calls of high frequencies, large bandwidth, and
   very low amplitude. Foraging behavior of bats was composed of two
   distinct stages: search or orienting flight followed by approach
   behavior consisting of exploration flights, multiple approaches of a
   selected fruit, and final acquisition of ripe figs in flight or in a
   brief landing. Both bat species continuously emitted echolocation calls.
   Structure and pattern of signals changed predictably when the bats
   switched from search or orienting calls to approach calls. We did not
   record a terminal phase before final acquisition of a fruit, as it is
   typical for aerial insectivorous bats prior to capture. Both bat species
   selected ripe over unripe fruit and non-infested over infested fruit.
   Artibeus watsoni preferred larger over smaller fruit. We conclude from
   our experiments, that the bats used a combination of odor-guided
   detection together with echolocation for localization in order to find
   ripe fruit and to discriminate among them.}},

Abstract = {{We emphasize the necessity of a complex approach to evaluating

   include comparisons at the data, derived variable, distance, ordination
   and classification levels. A variety of data randomization methods
   incorporated in testing the significance of changes in raw data are
   introduced and compared. It is shown that these are true alternatives to
   Procrustean comparisons, which offer an apparently unfortunate choice in
   the presence/absence case. We propose to evaluate nearest neighbor
   relationships among quadrats in a new method, called adjacency analysis,
   to detect temporal trends that may remain unrevealed, should our
   attention be paid to full distance structures only. As an illustration,
   compositional and structural changes in the rock grassland vegetation of
   the Sas-hegy Nature Reserve (Budapest, Hungary), intensively sampled by
   quadrats in 1977 and 2000, are evaluated. Permutation tests show that
   differences between the 2 years are much smaller than expected by chance
   alone. Such an overall stability in community structure, however, does
   not mean that minor aspects of vegetation pattern are invariant over the
   years. Changes in life form and seed mass spectra are explained by the
   fluctuation of hemicryptophytes and the slight but detectable expansion
   of annuals and woody species. Classification is slightly rearranged in

   adjust detection thresholds for color or object classification, a
   subjective process we postulated would be influenced by human error and
   variation. We developed a ground -cover-measurement calibration
   procedure, the digital grid overlay (DGO), which is similar to image
   point sampling (dot grid) advanced by earlier researchers. We asked 21
   rangeland professionals to measure ground cover using 2 subjective
   visual-estimate methods (threshold adjustment process, or TAP, and
   external {[}to the software] visual estimate, or EVE) and the DGO on 5
   different nadir-view images of rangeland. We also compared cover
   measurements made by DGO-calibrated software in automated batch
   processing against DGO manual-only measurements. We found an
   unacceptable range of variation among rangeland professionals using TAP.
   The DGO and EVE values were more closely aligned. We discovered an
   age-related bias in bare-ground measurements: all users over 50 years of
   age classified more bare ground than did all users under 50 years of age
   when using TAR One explanation for this bias is age-related yellowing of

   analysis after software calibration. The greatest bare-ground difference
   between the DGO-calibrated software and manual DGO measurements for the

   accurate automated measurements can be used for bare-ground measurements
   from digital-image data sets. The exception is where the software cannot
   adequately separate litter and bare ground. The digital methods we

Abstract = {{In 2002, Medicare health insurance recognized the relationship between
   pedestrian environments and public health by providing co-pay for health
   care delivered in residential land use. In this multi-disciplinary
   experiment, artificial intelligence (AI) and landscape architecture (LA)
   bridge their respective domains to measure and model the pedestrian
   reaction to walking environments in small town residential community in
   Central Texas. In the process, we gained a deeper understanding of the
   health motivation of walkers and their empirical relationship to various
   street environments that they used for health purposes. The analytical
   model we ultimately developed is a flexible tool that facilitates
   exploration of people's perceptions of the landscape, how the pedestrian
   landscapes are functioning in the opinion of its users, and how changes
   to the design of the walking domain may predictably affect physical
   activity levels with the associated health benefits.
   A pilot study involving fifty-four participants and six walking
   environments were used in the development of an analytical model that is
   significantly site-specific and grass roots oriented. Participant
   perceptions were measured querying each participant's rating of fifty
   discrete environmental variables taken. This data was then analyzed
   using the decision tree algorithm. Our primary objective was to capture
   the decision-making pattern walkers engage in when deciding to walk in a
   particular environment specifically for health purposes and to make this
   available to the designers of pedestrian environments in transportation
   corridors. The approach gave the designers new insight into the critical
   variables and the not so critical variables that affected people's
   decision to walk for health purposes. The results from the analysis
   defined measurable environmental variables that form the design for
   pedestrian activity in the six walking environments in the study area.
   A customized version of decision tree machine learning algorithm rules
   for designing good pedestrian landscapes for health purposes were
   extracted from the grass roots surveys. The data indicated that
   variables influencing the decision to walk for health purposes in the
   study area included weather, sound, water, light and edge of space. The
   analytical model derived from the discipline of artificial intelligence
   facilitated examining a subset of variables and manipulating of
   individual or group of these variables to better under-stand how the
   built environment affected decisions to walk for different purposes.
   This collaboration was our first phase in developing intelligent tools
   for designers that provided site-specific user-specific data to the
   planner or designer of pedestrian space. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier

   functional terms. The increase in between-habitat diversity caused a
   decline in geographic-scale variability as the two systems converged on
   a single, historically novel pattern of depth zonation.
   Twenty-four reef cores were extracted at water depths above 2 in in
   Bahia Almirante, a coastal lagoon in northwestern Panama. The cores
   showed that finger corals of the genus Porites dominated for the last
   2000-3000 yr. Porites remained dominant as the shallowest portions of
   the reefs grew to within 0.25 in of present sea level. At intermediate
   depths of 5-10 m, however, declining water quality in the Bahia enabled
   the lettuce coral Agaricia tenuifolia to replace Porites during the last
   several decades. In Belize, the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis
   dominated the rhomboid shoals of the central shelf lagoon for millennia.
   As the shallowest portions of the rhomboid shoals approached sea level
   around 500 years ago, Porites spp. replaced Ac. cervicornis in an
   intrinsically driven successional sequence. At intermediate depths,
   white-band disease killed Ac. cervicornis in the late 1980s,
   precipitating a transition to dominance by Ag. tenuifolia. Phase shifts
   between coral taxa and the emergence of coral zonation in both locations
   were mediated by the sea urchin Echinometra viridis, which controlled
   algal growth. Opposite trends in biotic variability at the habitat and
   geographic levels highlight the complex, scale-deperident nature of the
   response of coral reefs to intense perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{The realms of rare species conservation and metapopulation biology
   theory are often interrelated, and hence share several basic challenges.
   Two of the most important are the critical and frequently difficult
   tasks of distinguishing a priori between habitat and nonhabitat, and
   then delimiting suitable habitat patches in a study area. We combined
   classification tree analysis, a subset of classification and regression
   tree (CART) modeling, with digital data layers of environmental
   variables in a geographic information system (GIS) to predict suitable
   habitat and potential new population occurrences for turkeybeard
   (Xerophyllum asphodeloides), a rare liliaceous understory herb
   associated with southern Appalachian pine-oak (Pinus-Quercus) forests,
   in northwestern Virginia. Sample values from eight environmental data
   layers and population survey data were used in the modeling process to
   produce a cross-validated classification tree that predicted suitable
   habitat in the study area. Elevation, slope, forest type, and fire
   frequency were the four main explanatory variables in the model.
   Approximately 4\% of the study area was classified into five suitable
   habitat classes, with a misclassification error rate of 4.74\%. The
   final 13-leaf tree correctly classified 74\% of the known presence areas
   and 90\% of the known absence areas, and ground-truthing surveys
   resulted in the discovery of eight new occupied habitat patches. Results
   of this study are important for conservation and management of X.

   techniques to enhancing the study of metapopulations and disturbance
   regimes in Appalachian forests. In addition, they confirm the potential
   and value of CART and GIS-based modeling approaches to species
   distribution problems. Our model was successful at defining suitable
   habitat and discovering new populations of a rare species at the
   landscape scale. Similar application to other rare species could prove
   very useful for addressing these and other ecological and conservation
   issues, such as planning transplantation or reintroduction experiments,
   identifying metapopulation fragmentation thresholds, and formulating
   conservation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Are ordinal data appropriately treated by multivariate
   methods in numerical ecology? If not, what are the most common mistakes?
   Which dissimilarity coefficients, ordination and classification methods
   are best suited to ordinal data? Should we worry about such problems at
   all?
   Methods: A new classification model family, OrdClAn (Ordinal Cluster
   Analysis), is suggested for hierarchical and nonhierarchical
   classifications from ordinal ecological data,e.g. the
   abundance/dominance scores that are commonly recorded in releves. During
   the clustering process, the objects are grouped so as to minimize a
   measure calculated from the ranks of within-cluster and between-cluster
   distances or dissimilarities.
   Results and Conclusions: Evaluation of the various steps of exploratory
   data analysis of ordinal ecological data shows that consistency of
   methodology throughout the study is of primary importance. In an optimal
   Situation, each methodological step is order invariant. This property
   ensures that the results are independent of changes not affecting
   ordinal relationships, and guarantees that no illusory precision is
   introduced into the analysis. However, the multivariate procedures that
   are most commonly applied in numerical ecology do not satisfy these
   requirements and are therefore not recommended. For example, it is
   inappropriate to analyse Braun-Blanquet abudance/dominance data by
   methods assuming that Euclidean distance is meaningful. The solution of
   all problems is that the dissimilarity coefficient should be compatible
   with ordinal variables and the subsequent ordination or clustering
   method should consider only the rank order of dissimilarities. A range
   of artificial data sets exemplifying different subtypes of ordinal
   variables, e.g. indicator values or species scores from releves,
   illustrate the advocated approach. Detailed analyses of an actual
   phytosociological data set demonstrate the classification by OrdClAn of
   releves and species and the subsequent tabular rearrangement, in a
   numerical Study remaining within the ordinal domain from the first step
   to the last.}},

Abstract = {{Question: How have the spatial and temporal aspects of past disturbance
   shaped the current structure and composition of old-growth Picea rubens
   forests?
   Location: Northern Maine, USA.
   Methods: We established three 50 m x 50 m plots in old-growth Picea
   rubens forests and mapped the location of trees and saplings. We
   extracted increment cores from canopy trees, and recorded growth
   releases indicating past disturbance. By linking spatial data (tree
   positions) and temporal data (dated growth releases), we reconstructed
   the location and size of former canopy gaps back to 1920, and determined
   a more general disturbance chronology extending as far back as 1740.
   Results: We found no evidence of stand-replacing disturbances. The
   disturbance dynamic includes pulses of moderate-severity disturbances
   caused by wind storms and hostspecific disturbance agents (spruce
   budworm, spruce bark beetle) interposed upon a background of scattered
   smaller canopy gaps. Consequently, rates of disturbance fluctuated
   considerably overtime. Reconstructed canopy gaps were temporally and
   spatially scattered; during disturbance peaks, they were both larger and
   more numerous.
   Conclusions: Despite peaks in disturbance, several of which created
   relatively large gaps, this system has experienced no significant change
   in species composition. Instead, the shade-tolerant Picea rubens has
   maintained canopy dominance. The patch dynamics described here consist
   of dramatic structural, not compositional, changes to the forest. The
   persistence of Picea rubens is attributed to a combination of traits:
   (1) abundance of advance regeneration; (2) ability to endure suppression
   and respond favourably to release; and (3) longevity relative to
   ecologically similar species.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new approach to set fish quotas from holistic aquatic

   calculations of nutrient concentrations from inflow, internal processes

   affect primary production, how such changes influence secondary
   production and how this influence fish production and biomass. This
   approach gives dynamic, quantitative responses to alterations in driving
   variables and abiotic/biotic feedbacks. We have applied this approach
   for preliminary simulations of the cod biomass in the Baltic. We also
   show that this approach adds a new dimension in setting fish quotas,
   which in the future could complement, rather than compete with, the more
   established methods used today based on fish catch statistics and models
   based on other presuppositions. Our preliminary results indicate that
   under present environmental conditions (2003), the cod is likely to be
   extinct if the annual catch is between 95 and 100 kt. The present fish
   quota is 75 kt/yr in the Baltic, but the over fishing may be 35 kt/yr.

Abstract = {{1. Quantitative predictions of the effects of perturbations on
   communities of interacting species have often proved to be difficult.
   However, if precise predictions are not a requirement then qualitative
   models of community dynamics offer an alternative method for predicting
   species responses to perturbations.
   2. We used two qualitative modelling approaches to predict the effects
   of predator control on the fledging rate of an endangered New Zealand
   bird, the North Island kokako. The first approach was based on loop
   analysis and provided predictions on the probable direction of change in
   species abundances to single species perturbations. The second approach,
   `fuzzy interaction webs', used fuzzy logic in the framework of a fuzzy
   cognitive map to provide predictions on the probable magnitude of change
   in species abundances to perturbations.
   3. Using both methods, we predicted the qualitative change in the
   equilibrium fledging rates of kokako under various regimes of single-
   and multispecies predator control (ship rats, brushtail possums and
   stoats). Single species control was insufficient to lift the fledging
   rate from `low' to `moderate'. However, simultaneous control of both
   ship rats and possums had the greatest influence on the fledging rates
   compared with any other combination as a result of the additional
   indirect effect of ship rat control on stoat abundance.
   4. We propose qualitative modelling of community dynamics as a method
   suitable for predicting the effects of perturbations in complex
   ecological communities that can encapsulate diverse sources of knowledge
   about food web interactions. We believe that these methods are a useful
   set of heuristic tools that can be used to propose testable hypotheses
   about ecosystem functioning that can complement existing statistical and
   quantitative modelling approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Population bottlenecks wield a powerful influence on the evolution of

   modern data. The difference in power between the modern and temporal DNA

Abstract = {{The Karner blue butterfly (KBB) (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), a
   federally listed species, has historically been a component of barren
   and savannah ecosystems in the northeastern and midwestern United
   States. In New York, it now occurs primarily on managed,
   early-successional sites such as power line corridors (utility
   rights-of-way) from Albany to Glens Falls. Blue lupine (Lupinus
   perennis), the exclusive larval food source of the KBB, has been
   suggested to be the most limiting factor for the butterfly within the
   eastern portion of its range. Power line corridor management maintains
   early-successional habitats by suppressing the regrowth of woody
   species, creating potentially important habitat for the conservation and
   restoration of the KBB complex. This research compared the effects of
   several vegetation-clearing methods on Blue lupine populations and
   associated communities of nectar species for KBB over an 8-year period.
   Methods evaluated differed in intensity (annual, 4-, or 8-year
   intervals) and type (herbicide or mechanical). Blue lupine and plant
   community responses did not significantly differ among the treatment
   types applied to the power line corridors. However, Blue lupine cover,
   clump size, and density of stems per clump increased following the
   application of treatments in general. The number and cover of nectar
   species, total herbaceous cover, and species richness also responded
   positively to treatment overall. The percentage of non-native species
   temporarily increased following treatment but declined to near
   pre-treatment levels again as woody cover increased. Temporal changes in
   plant community composition were not related to management methods. The
   management tools assessed, mowing and herbicide application, will
   accomplish the goal of halting or reversing succession, maintaining
   critical habitat for the KBB in a landscape that provides little other
   suitable habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Decision tree, one of the data mining methods, has been widely used as a
   modelling approach and has shown better predictive ability than
   traditional approaches (e.g. regression). However, very little is known
   from the literature about how the decision tree performs in predicting
   pasture productivity. In this study, decision tree models were developed
   to investigate and predict the annual and seasonal productivity of
   naturalised hill-pasture in the North Island, New Zealand, and were
   compared with regression models with respect to model fit, validation
   and predictive accuracy. The results indicated that the decision tree
   models for annual and seasonal pasture productivity all had a smaller
   average squared error (ASE) and a higher percentage of correctly
   predicted cases than the corresponding regression models. The decision
   tree model for annual pasture productivity had an ASE which was only
   half of that of the regression model, and correctly predicted 90\% of
   the cases in the model validation which was 10.8 percentage points
   higher than that of the regression model. Furthermore, the decision tree
   models for annual and seasonal pasture productivity also clearly
   revealed the relative importance of environmental and management
   variables in influencing pasture productivity, and the interaction among
   these variables. Spring rainfall was the most significant factor
   influencing annual pasture productivity, while hill slope was the most
   significant factor influencing spring and winter pasture productivity,
   and annual P fertiliser input and autumn rainfall were the most
   significant factors influencing summer and autumn pasture productivity.
   One limitation of using the decision tree to predict pasture
   productivity was that it did not generate a continuous prediction, and
   thus could not detect the influence of small changes in environmental
   and management variables on pasture productivity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The notion that species might exhibit thresholds in their response to
   habitat alteration is appealing from a conservation perspective. Such
   thresholds could be used as targets for conservation in managed
   landscapes. In New Brunswick, Canada, forest management produces mosaics
   of varying stand age, species composition, and structure. We sampled
   this gradient in habitat suitability to examine the shape of species
   response functions and to look for evidence of statistically significant
   thresholds. We focused our attention on bird species breeding in
   late-seral forest and surveyed them at 390 point-count stations sampling
   broad-leaved deciduous to pure coniferous stands and a variety of
   silvicultural treatments (patch cutting, single-tree selection, spruce
   plantation {[}35-45 years old], and no recent treatment). A principal
   components analysis (PCA) on local vegetation separated stations along
   two axes reflecting gradients in stand composition and habitat
   alteration (increasingly open canopy and decreasing density of large
   trees/snags), respectively. We combined logistic regression and
   receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to detect thresholds in
   species occurrence along these gradients. Of the 42 species frequent
   enough to be included in the analyses, 13 (31\%) showed a significant
   (p<0.01) negative response to habitat alteration. Eight of the 13
   species sensitive to habitat alteration exhibited thresholds in their
   occurrence after controlling for the suitability of local habitat.
   According to curves of the expected number of sensitive species (based
   on their ROC-derived thresholds), canopy closure and the density of
   large trees (>30 cm dbh) should be at least 70\% and 80 stems/ha,
   respectively, to expect to find the complete assemblage of bird species.
   However, these values should be viewed as liberal, given the nature of
   our response variable. More refined (e.g., fitness) parameters should be
   used to be conservative. Nonetheless, the approach allowed us to
   establish preliminary quantitative targets for conservation planning
   based on time-efficient sampling methods, and to explicitly account for
   the continuous variability existing within and among silvicultural
   treatments rather than to assume homogeneity within treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular clock methods allow biologists to estimate divergence times,
   which in turn play an important role in comparative studies of many
   evolutionary processes. It is well known that molecular age estimates
   can be biased by heterogeneity in rates of molecular evolution, but less
   attention has been paid to the issue of potentially erroneous fossil
   calibrations. In this study we estimate the timing of diversification in
   Centrarchidae, an endemic major lineage of the diverse North American
   freshwater fish fauna, through a new approach to fossil calibration and
   molecular evolutionary model selection. Given a completely resolved
   multi-gene molecular phylogeny and a set of multiple fossil-inferred age
   estimates, we tested for potentially erroneous fossil calibrations using
   a recently developed fossil cross-validation. We also used fossil
   information to guide the selection of the optimal molecular evolutionary
   model with a new fossil jackknife method in a fossil-based model
   cross-validation. The centrarchid phylogeny resulted from a mixed-model
   Bayesian strategy that included 14 separate data partitions sampled from
   three mtDNA and four nuclear genes. Ten of the 31 interspecific nodes in
   the centrarchid phylogeny were assigned a minimal age estimate from the
   centrarchid fossil record. Our analyses identified four fossil dates
   that were inconsistent with the other fossils, and we removed them from
   the molecular dating analysis. Using fossil-based model cross
   -validation to determine the optimal smoothing value in penalized
   likelihood analysis, and six mutually consistent fossil calibrations,
   the age of the most recent common ancestor of Centrarchidae was 33.59
   million years ago (mya). Penalized likelihood analyses of individual
   data partitions all converged on a very similar age estimate for this
   node, indicating that rate heterogeneity among data partitions is not
   confounding our analyses. These results place the origin of the
   centrarchid radiation at a time of major faunal turnover as the fossil
   record indicates that the most diverse lineages of the North American
   freshwater fish fauna originated at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary,
   approximately 34 mya. This time coincided with major global climate
   change from warm to cool temperatures and a signature of elevated
   lineage extinction and origination in the fossil record across the tree
   of life. Our analyses demonstrate the utility of fossil cross-validation
   to critically assess individual fossil calibration points, providing the
   ability to discriminate between consistent and inconsistent fossil age
   estimates that are used for calibrating molecular phylogenies.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The woodland ecosystems of south-eastern Australia have been
   extensively disturbed by agriculture and urbanization. Herein, the
   occurrence of birds in woodland remnants in three distinct landscapes
   was analysed to examine the effects of different types of landscape
   matrices on species richness vs. area and species richness vs. isolation
   relationships and individual species responses to woodland
   fragmentation.
   Location The study system comprised three distinct woodland landscapes
   of the northern Australian Capital Territory and bordering areas of New
   South Wales. These landscapes (termed agricultural, peri-urban and
   urban) are located within 50 km of each other, have remnant fragments of
   similar age, size, isolation, woodland cover, elevation and climates.
   The major distinguishing feature of the three landscapes was the
   properties of the habitats surrounding the numerous woodland remnants.
   Methods Bird surveys, using an area-search methodology, were conducted
   in 1999 and 2000 in 127 remnants in the three landscapes to determine
   bird species presence/absence. Each remnant was characterized by
   measures of remnant area, isolation and habitat complexity. To
   characterize differences between each landscape, we conducted an
   analysis of the amount of tree cover and human disturbance in each
   landscape using SPOT imagery and aerial photographs. Linear regressions
   of woodland-dependent species richness vs. remnant area and remnant
   isolation for the three different landscapes were calculated to see if
   there were any apparent differences. Binomial logistic regressions were
   used to determine the relationships between the occurrence of each
   species and the size and isolation of woodland habitat, in each
   landscape.
   Results All the landscapes displayed a significant (P < 0.01) species
   vs. area relationship, but the slope of the urban relationship was
   significantly greater than those of the other landscapes. In contrast,
   only the agricultural landscape displayed a significant (P < 0.01)
   species richness vs. isolation relationship. When individual species
   were investigated, we found species that were: (1) apparently
   insensitive to reduction in remnant area and increase in isolation
   across all landscapes, (2) absent in small remnants in all landscapes,
   (3) absent in small remnants in all landscapes and also absent in
   isolated remnants in the agricultural landscape, (4) absent in isolated
   remnants in the agricultural landscape, and (5) absent in small remnants
   in the urban landscape. Threshold values (50\% probability of
   occurrence) for area and isolation for individual species were highly
   variable across the three landscapes.
   Main conclusions These results indicate that woodland bird communities
   have a varying response to habitat fragmentation in different
   landscapes. Whilst we cannot be sure how representative our chosen
   landscapes are of other similarly composed landscapes, these results
   suggest that the type of landscape matrix may have a considerable
   influence on how bird species are affected by woodland fragmentation in
   the region. For instance, the properties of a matrix may influence both
   the resources available in the landscape as a whole for different bird
   species, and the connectivity (dispersal of birds), between woodland
   remnants. We encourage further research that examines these hypotheses
   and argue that the management of the matrix should be included in
   conservation strategies for fragmented landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Although parental care occurs in most phyla encompassing a wide array of
   forms, little is known about its evolution in invertebrates. Two types
   of egg capsules have been known among ovoviviparous New Zealand
   hydrobiid gastropods, elastic capsules and simple membranes. Based on a
   phylogenetic analysis using two mtDNA sequence fragments, I asked
   whether the second state was derived from the first or whether brooding
   had multiple origins. The evolution of ovoviviparity was also
   investigated in the context of habitat transition between brackish and
   freshwater. Maximum parsimony and Markov chain models of character state
   transformations in a maximum likelihood framework suggested that
   hydrobiids have invaded freshwater three times independently. Two of
   these invasions were followed by the evolution of ovoviviparity,
   probably in adaptation to changing water levels during periods of
   irregular precipitation. The syntopy of two congeneric species, one
   oviparous and the other one brooding, indicated that the transition
   between reproductive modes must have occurred rapidly.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural land use changes can influence soil erosion process. The
   objective of this study was to investigate impact of historical land use
   changes on soil erosion and sediment transport in the Kali Basin study
   area, a small catchment located in a national park at Lake Balaton,
   Hungary. The Kali Basin is of high landscape value where vine (Vitis
   spp.) growing has been ongoing since the Roman times. Lake Balaton is a
   recreational area of international significance, thus research on
   sediment and nutrient fluxes is of paramount importance for lake
   protection. The SEDEM/WATEM distributed erosion and sediment transport
   model was used to calculate sediment fluxes from the Kali Basin
   catchment into the lake. The model was calibrated against long-term
   measured suspended sediments at the catchment outlet and it was
   validated against independent soil survey data. Application of GIs
   methods for model development and interpretation was emphasised. Results
   showed that, despite the low overall sediment export from the catchment,
   land use changes introduced by property ownership and agricultural
   changes have decreased average sediment production in the catchment but
   increased relative sediment export to Lake Balaton. This is due to
   changes in the land cover pattern that allow more sediment transported
   to the river system. Erosion impact of dramatic land use changes such as
   change to centrally directed economy after the WWII and transition to
   market economy a decade ago in the study area are discussed. Similar
   land use changes due to socio-economic changes are typical in most of
   Central and Eastern European New Member States and Candidate Countries,
   thus the investigation of similar sites is an important contribution to
   the understanding of erosion impact of land use changes and to efficient
   agricultural and landscape management in the enlarged European Union.

Abstract = {{African savannah fires are key sources of trace gases and aerosols, yet
   their true magnitude remains relatively poorly constrained. Here we
   present a detailed investigation of the amount of unburned material
   remaining in the ash produced by such fires, and examine whether this
   quantity needs to be considered when calculating atmospheric emissions.
   Emissions estimates for individual fires are usually based upon a
   calculation of the amount of fuel biomass combusted, usually estimated
   via a ``simple subtraction{''} of the pre- and post-fire fuel loads.
   However, certain studies have concluded that this approach leads to
   gross overestimation of emissions, by perhaps 100\%, due to the fact
   that a proportion of unburned fuel normally remains in the ``charred{''}
   ash and that the simple subtraction method fails to take this fully into
   account. Whilst this latter point is true, we show that the mathematical
   relationship used previously to calculate the implications of this for
   emissions calculation is flawed. We demonstrate a new first-principles
   derivation of the quantity of mass combusted, taking into account any
   fuel remaining in the ash via measurement of ash mass loss on ignition
   (LOI). Using data from dry-season experimental fires in Botswana, we
   compared estimates of biomass combusted calculated via our LOI-based
   method to those obtained via the simple subtraction approach. We found a
   mean difference of < 10\%, far less than the factor of 2 difference
   obtained when using the previous erroneous formula. Similar results are
   obtained for carbon and nitrogen emissions, and the findings are further
   supported by reassessment of previous data from early-to-mid-dry season
   savanna fires in Tanzania. These results indicate that the simple
   subtraction method overestimates emissions by far less than previously
   suggested, and that the method is likely to provide sufficient accuracy
   in most situations where emissions calculations are required. For fires
   where very substantial amounts of unburned material are expected to
   remain within the ash, and where an LOI-based approach to emissions
   calculation may therefore be particularly warranted, it is important
   that the correct formula derived herein is used, since errors inherent
   in the previous formula increase with increasing ash LOI.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for producing a functional-structural
   plant model that simulates response to different growth conditions, yet
   does not require detailed knowledge of underlying physiology. The
   example used to present this method is the modelling of the mountain
   birch tree. This new functional-structural modelling approach is based
   on linking an L-system representation of the dynamic structure of the
   plant with a canonical mathematical model of plant function. Growth
   indicated by the canonical model is allocated to the structural model
   according to probabilistic growth rules, such as rules for the placement
   and length of new shoots, which were derived from an analysis of
   architectural data. The main advantage of the approach is that it is
   relatively simple compared to the prevalent process-based
   functional-structural plant models and does not require a detailed
   understanding of underlying physiological processes, yet it is able to
   capture important aspects of plant function and adaptability, unlike
   simple empirical models. This approach, combining canonical modelling,
   architectural analysis and L-systems, thus fills the important role of
   providing an intermediate level of abstraction between the two extremes
   of deeply mechanistic process-based modelling and purely empirical
   modelling.
   We also investigated the relative importance of various aspects of this
   integrated modelling approach by analysing the sensitivity of the
   standard birch model to a number of variations in its parameters,
   functions and algorithms. The results show that using light as the sole
   factor determining the structural location of new growth gives
   satisfactory results. Including the influence of additional regulating
   factors made little difference to global characteristics of the emergent
   architecture. Changing the form of the probability functions and using
   alternative methods for choosing the sites of new growth also had little
   effect. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In Vietnam, the remarkable economic growth that resulted from the doi
   moi ( renovation) reforms was based largely on the rural households that
   had become the new basic unit of agricultural production in the early
   1990s. The technical, economic, and social changes that accompanied the
   decollectivization process transformed agricultural production, resource
   management, land use, and the institutions that defined access to
   resources and their distribution. Combined with the extreme biophysical,
   technical, and social heterogeneity encountered in the northern
   mountains, these rapid changes led to the extreme complexity of the
   agrarian dynamics that today challenges traditional diagnostic
   approaches. Since 1999, a participatory simulation method has been
   developed to disentangle the cause-and-effect relationships between the
   different driving forces and changes in land use observed at different
   scales. Several tools were combined to understand the interactions
   between human and natural systems, including a narrative conceptual
   model, an agent-based spatial computational model ( ABM), a role-playing
   game, and a multiscale geographic information system (GIS). We
   synthesized into an ABM named SAMBA-GIS the knowledge generated from the
   above tools applied to a representative sample of research sites. The
   model takes explicitly into account the dynamic interactions among: ( 1)
   farmers' strategies, i.e., the individual decision-making process as a
   function of the farm's resource profile; ( 2) the institutions that
   define resource access and usage; and ( 3) changes in the biophysical
   and socioeconomic environment. The next step consisted of coupling the
   ABM with the GIS to extrapolate the application of local management
   rules to a whole landscape. Simulations are initialized using the layers
   of the GIS, e. g., land use in 1990, accessibility, soil
   characteristics, etc., and statistics available at the village level, e.
   g., population, ethnicity, livestock, etc. At each annual time step, the
   agrarian landscape changes according to the decisions made by
   agent-farmers about how to allocate resources such as labor force,
   capital, and land to different productive activities, e. g., crops,
   livestock, gathering of forest products, off-farm activities. The
   participatory simulations based on SAMBA-GIS helped identify villages
   with similar land-use change trajectories to which the same types of
   technical and/or institutional innovations could be applied. Scenarios
   of land-use changes were developed with local stakeholders to assess the
   potential impact of these changes on the natural resource base and on
   agricultural development. This adaptive approach was gradually refined
   through interactions between researchers and the local population.}},

Abstract = {{1 The effect of elevated CO2 on species' performance was investigated in

   Matricaria chamomilla L., Silene noctiflora L., Papaver rhoeas L. and
   Legousia speculum-veneris (L.) Chaix.
   2 The experiment was based on a simplex design, repeated at two overall
   levels of initial stand density, to give a wide range of five-species
   communities across which the initial composition and species abundance
   varied systematically.
   3 A multivariate method, based on analysing the differences in relative
   growth rates (RGRD) between pairs of species, was extended for use with
   more than two species, in order to assess the relative importance of
   various determinants of change in stand biomass composition.
   4 On average, Centaurea (54.6\% of final yield) gave the highest yield,
   followed by Matricaria (22.9\%), Silene (16.9\%), Legousia (3.1\%) and
   Papaver (2.7\%).
   5 The major determinants of change in community structure were species
   identity and CO2 level. Elevated CO2 significantly changed community
   composition towards the previously more poorly performing species
   Silene, Legousia and Papaver.
   6 Despite strong effects of intra- and interspecific competition on
   individual species performance, species' initial abundance had
   relatively little impact on the change in community composition. Most
   cases where such effects were significant involved Silene: performance
   of Papaver was poorer in communities with higher initial presence of
   Silene and higher initial abundances of Centaurea and Matricaria always
   facilitated performance of Silene.

   1.11 in controls. With disturbance and complete removal of the
   surrounding vegetation the effect was even stronger, and lambda
   increased to 1.60.
   4. Increases in lambda were primarily a result of increased growth of
   the smallest rosettes, and increased seedling production. In contrast,
   the performance of larger P. veris individuals was not affected by
   experimental treatments.
   5. The higher the elasticity of a particular life cycle transition, the
   less the change in the transition rate caused by treatments. This
   suggests that plants are able partly to buffer the effects of
   environmental variation by minimizing changes in the life cycle
   transitions that are most important to population growth rate.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Experimental demographic approaches
   provide an important tool for assessing how grazing and other types of
   management influence species viability, and help to unravel the
   mechanisms underlying such relationships. With such information it is
   possible to predict the effects of novel types of management and
   land-use scenarios on population viability. For P. veris, we identified
   seedling establishment as a key phase in the life cycle, and litter
   accumulation as a key environmental factor, suggesting that these should
   be prime targets for management. One practice that is likely to favour
   as well as seedling establishment preventing litter accumulation is late
   summer grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Question: What are the tempo and mode of long-term succession and of
   demographic processes in an alpine community, especially: tenacity,
   transition patterns, predictions. growth of individual cushion plants,
   cyclic succession, spatial patterns?
   Location: A low-alpine mixed cushion/turf/snow-tussock shrub community
   in southeastern New Zealand. Methods: The distribution of seven plant
   cover-types was recorded at 1024 fixed points in an 8 m x 8 m plot at
   approximately decade intervals for 50 years. The diameters of eight
   Donatia novae-zelandiae cushions were monitorec.
   Results: The process was essentially first-order Markovian. There was a
   chance in transition frequencies about 1980. The tenacity of the two
   major cover types - cushion and turf - was high. but that of cushion
   decreased about 1980 as some of its area was taken over by turf. The
   original informal prediction of 1955 that the cushion/turf Would
   increase proved to be correct. probably because of paludification of the
   site. A prediction of 1987 made from observed transitions that cushion
   would dominate over turf has proved untrue because of a change in the
   transition probabilities in the 1980s, of unknown cause. There is a
   ten-fold range in diameter growth rates among the eight cushions
   measured, but the mean rate of 5.3 mm.a(-1) is similar to that reported
   from other alpine and arctic sites. As cushions aged. turf colonized
   their centres, and in two cases new cushions colonized into this turf:
   consistent with cyclic succussion. The pattern of transitions was
   compatible with a general interpretation Of Cyclic succession. but not
   definitive.
   Conclusions: Change is slow in this alpine community, and tenacity high.
   The change in transition frequencies about 1980. the invasion of
   individual Cushions, and the decrease in spatial autocorrelation all
   suggest that Cushions established on the site as a result of the
   clearance of woody vegetation after 1400 AD. Paludification may be
   causing some loss Of tussock grass. A tendency for the cushions to break
   Lip, and the shallow peat accumulated below them, may indicate that they
   are the first generation of cushions on the site. Though these cushions
   are breaking up, other cushions are establishing, and cushions will
   continue to be ail important part of the vegetation dynamics which may
   be part of a cyclic succession.}},

Abstract = {{Fossil data have been interpreted as indicating that Late Cretaceous

   provide new tests of these hypotheses. We estimate that all 28 major

   originated in tropical rain forest well before the Tertiary, mostly
   during the Albian and Cenomanian ( 112 - 94 Ma). Their rapid rise in the
   mid-Cretaceous may have resulted from the origin of adaptations to
   survive and reproduce under a closed forest canopy. This pattern may
   also be paralleled by other similarly diverse lineages and supports
   fossil indications that closed-canopy tropical rain forests existed well
   before the K/T boundary. This case illustrates that dated phylogenies

Abstract = {{Non-compliance with marine protected area (MPA) regulations is a problem

   The strongest factor was employment, with fishers having significantly

Abstract = {{Reaction norms for age and size at maturity are being analyzed to answer
   important questions about the evolution of life histories. A new
   statistical method is developed in the framework of time-to-event data
   analysis, which circumvents shortcomings in currently available
   approaches. The method emphasizes the estimation of age-and
   size-dependent maturation rates. Individual probabilities of maturation
   during any given time interval follow by integrating maturation rate
   along the growth curve. The integration may be performed in different
   ways, over ages or sizes or both, corresponding to different assumptions
   on how individuals store the operational history of the maturation
   process. Data analysis amounts to fitting generalized nonlinear
   regression models to a maturation status variable. This technique has
   three main advantages over existing methods: (1) treating maturation as
   a stochastic process enables one to specify a rate of maturation; (2)
   age and size at which maturation occurs do not have to be observed
   exactly, and bias arising from approximations and interpolations is
   avoided; (3) ages at which sizes are measured and maturation status are
   observed can differ between individuals. An application to data on the
   springtail Folsomia candida is presented. Models with age-dependent
   integration of maturation rates were preferred. The analysis

Abstract = {{Questions: Does the spatial structure or rate of spread of anther-smut

   is the demographic pattern of seedling recruitment and host mortality in
   S. acaulis? How do the temporal dynamics of anther-smut disease differ
   among hosts that vary in lifespan and population persistence?
   Organisms: Silene acaulis, a long-lived alpine tundra perennial, and
   Microbotryum violaceum, a pollinator-transmitted fungus that causes
   anther-smut disease.
   Field site and time: Plots ranged in elevation from 3658 to to 3964 m on
   Pennsylvania Mountain Field Station owned by Colorado State University,
   Park County, Colorado, USA. Six plots (6 x 10 m) were spatially mapped
   for 5-8 years and three of these plots were monitored for seedling
   recruitment and host mortality for 8 years.
   Methods: The spatial structure of healthy, diseased and juvenile plants
   was monitored in natural plots that ranged in host density from 3 to 27
   plants per square metre and from 5-25\% in initial disease frequency.
   The spatial pattern of diseased plants was analysed using Moran's I, and
   a join-count method was used to analyse nearest-neighbour relationships
   of juveniles and healthy or diseased adults. Data on rate of disease
   spread and loss were monitored in all plots. Demographic data on
   seedling recruitment and host mortality, as well as spore dispersal
   patterns, were monitored in three of the six plots.
   Results: Infections were stable regardless of host density or initial
   disease frequency; less than 1\% of healthy individuals became infected
   and less than 1\% diseased individuals lost infection over the 8-year
   study period. Diseased plants were significantly clustered at the scale
   of less than I m in five of six plots; Moran's 1, a measure of spatial
   autocorrelation, ranged from 0.1 to 0.6. There was a trend for higher
   autocorrelation values in plots with lower host density. The number of
   new seedlings was consistently greater than either the number of deaths
   or new infections. The annual rate of disease spread in S. acaulis is
   lower than that reported for four other hosts of the same disease.
   Among-species comparisons suggest that the spatial clustering of
   diseased plants, rarity of vegetative infection of juveniles, short
   flowering time and high temporal stability of S. acaulis populations
   contribute to the relatively low rate of disease spread in S. acaulis.}},

Abstract = {{Question: How can we numerically discriminate with explicit confidence
   the alternative phenotypes in dimorphic species with bimodal threshold
   traits?
   Mathematical method: A bimodal distribution of a dimorphic trait is
   parameterized by mixture distribution models for normal and gamma
   distributions. Likelihood ratios of the alternative phenotypes for a
   given trait size are computed from the mixture models. The likelihood
   models are tested in several horn-dimorphic beetles and compared with
   existing piece-wise linear regression methods.
   Key assumptions: The bimodal distribution represents a mixture of two
   discrete distributions. The alternative phenotypes have normal or gamma
   distributions.
   Conclusions: Likelihood methods effectively model the way in which
   alternative phenotypes are expressed in taxa with bimodal trait size
   frequency distributions. New likelihood models estimate the probability
   that a given trait size represents a given phenotype in normal to skewed
   bimodal frequency distributions. These prove theoretically and
   empirically superior to linear regression methods. Likelihood methods
   model the behaviour of threshold mechanisms in natural populations and

   individuals. The proposed method performs the fitting a statistical
   model of the two possible QTL states in each F0 grandparent, that is,
   homozygous and heterozygous at QTL, and gives a posterior distribution
   for the QTL states in each F0 grandparent. We confine ourselves to the
   discrimination of two QTL states, homozygous or heterozygous, for each
   of the F0 grandparents without taking into consideration whether common
   alleles are shared by F0 grandparents. The statistical model includes
   allelic effects and dominance effects for each QTL. The number of
   parameters representing allelic effects and dominance effects is
   therefore changed depending on the QTL states. A Reversible Jump MCMC
   technique is used for transition between the models of different

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Habitat structure has broad impacts on many biological systems. In
   particular, habitat fragmentation can increase the probability of
   species extinction and on the other hand it can lead to population
   outbreaks in response to a decline in natural enemies. An extreme
   consequence of fragmentation is the isolation of small regions of
   suitable habitat surrounded by a large region of hostile matrix. This
   scenario can be interpreted as a critical patch-size problem, well
   studied in a continuous time framework, but relatively new to discrete
   time models. In this paper we present an integrodifference
   host-parasitoid model, discrete in time and continuous in space, to
   study how the critical habitat-size necessary for parasitoid survival
   changes in response to parasitoid life history traits, such as emergence
   time. We show that early emerging parasitoids may be able to persist in
   smaller habitats than late emerging species. The model predicts that
   these early emerging parasitoids lead to more severe host outbreaks. We
   hypothesise that promoting efficient late emerging parasitoids may be
   key in reducing outbreak severity, an approach requiring large
   continuous regions of suitable habitat. We parameterise the model for
   the host species of the forest tent caterpillar Malacosoma disstria
   Hbn., a pest insect for which fragmented landscape increases the
   severity of outbreaks. This host is known to have several parasitoids,
   due to paucity of data and as a first step in the modelling we consider
   a single generic parasitoid. The model findings are related to
   observations of the forest tent caterpillar offering insight into this
   host-parasitoid response to habitat structure. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Land use models provide a way to examine the impacts of future
   urbanization and alternative land use regulations on the environment
   before irreversible changes are made. A simple spatially-explicit model
   was used to explore potential build-out conditions under different sets

   build-out scenarios were created based on: (1) current regulations, (2)
   down zoning, (3) protecting a buffer around wetlands, and (4) open space
   protection. Various indicators were used to measure the impacts of
   build-out land use on: (1) water demand, (2) urban non-point source
   pollution, and (3) terrestrial habitat fragmentation. Potential change
   from 1995 to build-out and differences between the four build-out
   scenarios were identified based on the indicators. The analysis suggests
   that substantial changes will occur in the watershed before build-out,
   but that there is little difference between the four regulatory
   scenarios examined. In all cases, water demand is projected to exceed
   water supply, water quality is projected to be severely impacted in
   several locations, and terrestrial habitat will be further fragmented.
   Based on these results, the ability of regulatory approaches commonly

Abstract = {{Although still controversial, estimation of divergence times using
   molecular data has emerged as a powerful tool to examine the tempo and
   mode of evolutionary change. Two primary obstacles in improving the
   accuracy of molecular dating are heterogeneity in DNA substitution rates
   and accuracy of the fossil record as calibration points. Recent
   methodological advances have provided powerful methods that estimate
   relative divergence times in the face of heterogeneity of nucleotide
   substitution rates among lineages. However, relatively little attention
   has focused on the accuracy of fossil calibration points that allow one
   to translate relative divergence times into absolute time. We present a
   new cross-validation method that identifies inconsistent fossils when
   multiple fossil calibrations are available for a clade and apply our
   method to a molecular phylogeny of living turtles with fossil
   calibration times for 17 of the 22 internal nodes in the tree. Our
   cross-validation procedure identified seven inconsistent fossils. Using
   the consistent fossils as calibration points, we found that despite
   their overall antiquity as a lineage, the most species-rich clades of
   turtles diversified well within the Cenozoic. Many of the truly ancient
   lineages of turtles are currently represented by a few, often endangered
   species that deserve high priority as conservation targets.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of sea turtles spend part of their life cycle gathered in
   large feeding aggregations that combine individuals from widely
   separated rookery populations. Biologists have applied methods of
   mixed-stock analysis to mitochondrial DNA samples from rookeries and
   mixed populations to estimate the contributions of different rookeries
   to the mixed stock. These methods are limited by the amount of genetic
   overlap between rookeries and fail to incorporate ecological covariates
   such as rookery size and location within major ocean currents that are
   strongly suspected to affect rookery contributions. A new hierarchical
   Bayesian model for rookery contributions incorporates these covariates
   (and potentially others) to draw stronger conclusions from existing
   data. Applying the model to various simple scenarios shows that, in some
   cases,: it can accurately estimate turtle origins even when turtles come
   from rookeries with high degrees of genetic overlap., Applying the model
   to more complex simulations shows that it performs well in a wide range
   of scenarios. Applying the model to existing data on green turtles
   (Chelonia mydas) narrows confidence intervals but does not change point
   estimates significantly. Applying it to loggerhead turtles (Caretta
   caretta) strengthens the dominance of the large rookery in south
   Florida, and brings estimates from a small data set on sea turtle
   strandings into line with those from rookery data. Used appropriately,
   hierarchical Bayesian methods offer great. potential for introducing
   multiple levels of variation and ecological covariates into ecological

Abstract = {{Although there is clear evidence that climate change influences

   synchronous variation in radial increment growth of the main roots of

   limited extreme climatic events on herbaceous vegetation. This new

Abstract = {{Within the framework of the transdisciplinary research project ``Changes
   in alpine landscapes resulting from a decline in land use in the Val
   Grande National Park and Strona Valley-from rural landscape to
   wilderness{''}, the impacts of uncontrolled nature development on the
   landscape's structural diversity, plant species richness, as well as on
   the local population and tourists were investigated. The study area was
   the community of Premosello Chiovenda in the Val Grande National
   Park-{''}Italy's largest wilderness area{''}. In order to achieve
   reliable results, methods for conducting historical landscape analysis,
   ecological inventories and empirical-social research were combined. As a
   result of land abandonment, the floristic species richness is decreasing
   in higher successional stages, and depending on the altitude, the
   structural diversity of the landscape is changing. Wildfires in the
   successional communities pose threats to the neighbouring villages.
   Nevertheless, many rural and cultural landscape characteristics persist,
   and past uses continue to have a significant impact on future landscape
   development. The main impacts on the inhabitants are psychological and
   economic in nature. Around the villages, they regard the effects of
   abandonment in a very negative light. Visitors of the area judge the
   consequences of land abandonment differently. While they regard the
   resulting landscape's wildness positively, they also regret the cultural
   losses suffered by rural communities. If the abandoning processes
   continue, rural landscape and its associated habitats will be lost.
   Despite this, new habitats, such as those resulting from ecosystem
   dynamics, will form. The evolving landscape is not, however, hospitable
   as a living space for man. The characteristics intrinsic to the
   landscape in the absence of its productive use and maintenance render it
   uninhabitable. A reasonable scenario for Premosello Chiovenda should
   provide the coexistence of dynamic, ``wild{''} areas, free from further
   agri- or silvicultural uses and areas of cultural importance, where
   traditional and innovative forms of land use should be encouraged and
   developed. In the future, decision-makers should be aware of the
   positive and negative aspects of a large-scale rewilding, and all
   stakeholders, especially the affected local communities, should be
   included in any decision making process that concerns the establishment
   of protected areas which are left to develop without human control. (C)

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{61-73}},
Abstract = {{This paper gathers a series of structural and biochemical in situ
   characterizations carried out to improve our knowledge of the fine scale
   growth patterns of fibres in coral skeletons. The resulting data show a
   clear correspondence between the mineral subunits of fibres and the
   spatial distribution of organic macromolecules. New observations using
   atomic force microscope confirm the close relationship between mineral
   and organic phases at the nanometre scale.
   Synthesis of these data results in a significant change in our concept
   of the mineralization process in coral skeletons. In contrast to the
   usual view of an aggregate of purely mineral units independently growing
   by simple chemical precipitation, coral fibres appear to be fully
   controlled structures. Their growth process is based on cyclic secretion
   of mineralizing compounds by the polyp basal ectoderm. These biochemical
   components of the coral fibres, in which sulfated acidic proteoglycans
   probably play a major role, are repeatedly produced (proteoglycans are
   those glycoproteins whose carbohydrate moieties consist of long
   unbranched chains of sulfated amino sugars). This results in a stepping
   growth mode of fibres and a layered global organization of coral
   skeletons.
   Therefore, in contrast to the widely accepted geochemical
   interpretation, we propose a fibre growth model that places coral
   skeletons among the typical ``matrix mediated{''} structures. The
   crystal-like fibres are built by superimposition of few micron-thick
   growth layers. A biomineralization cycle starts by the secretion of a
   mineralizing matrix and the final step is the crystallization phase,
   during which mineral material grows onto the organic framework. Thus,
   each growth layer is the actual Environment Recording Unit.
   From a practical standpoint, these results may contribute to develop a
   new high resolution approach of the environment recording by coral
   skeletons.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{39-59}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Leaf phenology remains one of the most difficult processes to
   parameterize in terrestrial ecosystem models because our understanding
   of the physical processes that initiate leaf onset and senescence is
   incomplete. While progress has been made at the molecular level, for
   example by identifying genes that are associated with senescence and
   flowering for selected plant species, a picture of the processes
   controlling leaf phenology is only beginning to emerge. A variety of
   empirical formulations have been used with varying degrees of success in
   terrestrial ecosystem models for both extratropical and tropical biomes.
   For instance, the use of growing degree-days (GDDs) to initiate leaf
   onset has received considerable recognition and this approach is used in
   a number of models. There are, however, limitations when using GDDs and
   other empirically based formulations in global transient climate change
   simulations.
   The phenology scheme developed for the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem
   Model (CTEM), designed for inclusion in the Canadian Centre for Climate
   Modelling and Analysis coupled general circulation model, is described.
   The representation of leaf phenology is general enough to be applied
   over the globe and sufficiently robust for use in transient climate
   change simulations. Leaf phenology is functionally related to the
   (possibly changing) climate state and to atmospheric composition rather
   than to geographical boundaries or controls implicitly based on current
   climate. In this approach, phenology is controlled by environmental
   conditions as they affect the carbon balance. A carbon-gain-based scheme
   initiates leaf onset when it is beneficial for the plant, in carbon
   terms, to produce new leaves. Leaf offset is initiated by unfavourable
   environmental conditions that incur carbon losses and these include
   shorter day length, cooler temperatures, and dry soil moisture
   conditions. The comparison of simulated leaf onset and offset times with
   observation-based estimates for temperate and boreal deciduous, tropical
   evergreen, and tropical deciduous plant functional types at selected
   locations indicates that the phenology scheme performs satisfactorily.
   Model simulated leaf area index and stem and root biomass are also
   compared with observational estimates to illustrate the performance of
   CTEM.}},

Title = {{Errors in juvenile copepod growth rate estimates are widespread:
   problems with the Moult Rate method}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{296}},
Pages = {{263-279}},
Abstract = {{The `Moult Rate' (MR) method has been used widely to derive
   stage-specific growth rates in juvenile copepods. It is the most common
   field-based method. Unfortunately, the equation underlying the method is
   wrong and, consequently, large errors in juvenile growth rate estimates
   are widespread. The equation derives growth from the mean weight of 2
   consecutive stages (i and i + 1) and the duration of stage i. The weight
   change and the period to which this change is attributed are, therefore,
   offset. We explore this potential source of error in the MR method
   critically. Errors arise as a result of 2 primary factors: (1) unequal
   durations of successive stages and (2) unequal rates of growth of
   successive stages. The method of deriving the mean weight (arithmetic or
   geometric) also has an impact and is examined. Using a steady-state
   assumption, a range of scenarios and the errors that arise are examined.
   The literature is then reviewed and the size of errors resulting from MR
   method application in both field and laboratory situations is estimated.
   Our results suggest that the MR method can lead to large errors in
   growth estimation in any stage, but some stages are particularly prone.
   Errors for the C5 stage are often large because the following stage (the
   adult) does not moult, and has a different rate of body weight increase.
   For the same reason, errors are also great where the following stage is
   not actively moulting (e.g. when diapausing). In these circumstances,
   published work has commonly greatly underestimated growth. For example,
   MR growth ranges from 11 to 47 \% of the value derived correctly for
   this stage, g(i)\_(corr) (calculated assuming the non-moulting stage
   does not grow). In late stages that are followed by actively moulting
   stages, the MR method has commonly given values in excess of 150\% of
   g(i\_corr) but underestimation also occurs, with values < 90 \% of
   g(i\_corr) We propose new methods and equations that overcome these
   problems. These equations are written with and without within-stage
   mortality included. The equations are relatively insensitive to
   mortality rates within the range found in the field, but only provided
   that the stage duration is not determined from moult rate. Stage
   duration estimates obtained from measuring moulting rates of
   field-collected animals are very sensitive to mortality rates of the
   animals prior to capture, and field mortality rates are often high
   enough to produce dramatic over-estimation of stage duration.}},

Abstract = {{The species diversity of the Antarctic fish fauna changed notably during
   the approximate to40 million years from the Eocene to the present. A
   taxonomically restricted and endemic modern fauna succeeded a
   taxonomically diverse and cosmopolitan Eocene fauna. Although the
   Southern Ocean is 10\% of the world's ocean, its current fish fauna
   consists of only 322 species, small considering the global diversity of
   approximate to25,000-28,000 species. The fauna is ``reasonably
   well-known{''} from a taxonomic perspective. This intermediate
   designation between ``poorly known{''} and ``well-known{''} indicates
   that new species are regularly being described. A conservative estimate
   of the number of undescribed species is approximate to30-60; many of
   these may be liparids. On the Antarctic continental shelf and upper
   slope the fauna includes 222 species from 19 families of benthic fishes.
   The most speciose taxa are notothenioids, liparids and zoarcids,
   accounting for 88\% of species diversity. Endemism for Antarctic species
   is also, coincidentally, 88\%, at least threefold higher than in faunas
   from other isolated marine localities. Eight notothenioid families,
   including five that are primarily Antarctic, encompass a total of 44
   genera and 129 species, 101 Antarctic and 28 non-Antarctic. The 101
   Antarctic species make up 45\% of the benthic species diversity in the
   Antarctic region. However, at the highest latitudes, notothenioids
   contribute 77\% of the species diversity, 92\% of the abundance and 91\%
   of the biomass. Although species diversity is low compared to other
   shelf habitats, the nature of the adaptive radiation in organismal
   diversity among notothenioids is noteworthy in the marine realm. In some
   notothenioid clades phyletic diversification was accompanied by
   considerable morphological and ecological diversification. The exemplar
   is the benthic family Nototheniidae that underwent a habitat or depth
   related diversification centred on the alteration of buoyancy. They
   occupy an array of pelagic and benthopelagic habitats at various depths
   on the shelf and upper slope. Diversification in buoyancy is the
   hallmark of the nototheniid radiation and, in the absence of swim
   bladders, was accomplished by a combination of reduced skeletal
   mineralisation and lipid deposition. Although neutral buoyancy is found
   in only five species of nototheniids some, like Pleuragramma
   antarcticum, are abundant and ecologically important. Much work remains
   to be done in order to frame and to use phylogenetically based
   statistical methods to test hypotheses relating to the key features of
   the notothenioid radiation. To reach this analytical phase more
   completely resolved cladograms that include phyletically basal and
   non-Antarctic species are essential.}},

   preference on land use planning before structural measures to prevent
   from flooding; good maintenance of water courses to maintain initial
   flow capacity; flexible approaches to fix the protection objectives and
   hence the reference flood, in order to account for uncertainties, also
   in the context of climate change.
   In order to implement this new policy it was necessary to establish

Abstract = {{Dianchi Lake has water surface area of 298 km(2), mean depth of 4.4 m
   and catchment area of 2920 km(2), occupying the sixth largest fresh
   water lake in China. It is located at the elevation of 1886 meters
   a.s.l. Getting more intensive sunshine, the highland lake has the higher
   preliminary production and possesses the characteristics of lakes in the
   lower latitudes-lakes in the tropical zone. It was rich in aquatic
   vegetation with more than 100 species, in association with abundant
   biodiversity in history, The water quality of Dianchi Lake was quite
   good as the safe drinking water source before the 1970ties. It is a
   notable recreation site and reputed as ``a Sparkling Pearl Imbedded in
   the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau{''}. Starting from the last years of
   1970ties, the degradation of water quality became more rapidly. A lot of
   conventional measures have been taking for controlling eutrophication
   especially since 1980. But the problem for in proving water quality, to
   controlling eutrophication and to reconstructing the health
   aqua-ecosystem, is still far from its solving. All these aspects, such
   as the background information on the changes of eoc-environmental
   situation from healthy to degraded hyper-eutrophic state in Dianchi
   Lake, the reasons of rapid development of eutrophication in Dianchi
   Lake, the various measures and their results performed for controlling
   eutrophication were introduced in the first paragraphs of this Chapter.
   How can we save Dianchi Lake from progressive environmental
   deterioration? It needs to develop new strategies and technologies based
   on the laboratory and field experiments. After the event in 1990 (the
   direct economic lost was about USD 15 million during a week for Wuxi
   City, Jiangsu Province, after an event of algae bloom in Taihu Lake in
   summer 1990), a serial research and experiment projects directly towards
   for reconstruction of the helath aqua-ecosystem in local area,
   especially in the intake area of drinking water source was performed
   under the support of the Chinese State and Provincial Government, the
   Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the International Organizations as
   well. The small-scale experiments of a couple of thousands or ten
   thousands square meters were taken place in different environmental
   conditions. The research results were summarized in the retral
   paragraphs of this Chapter.
   The technology for reconstruction of healthy aqua-ecosystem and
   improvement of water quality in the surface waters from local to all the
   surface water systems in the catchment step by step mainly using solar
   energy was named as ``Physic-Ecological Engineering-PEEN. it contains 5
   key techniques, namely: i) Soft wall and physic-biological membrane
   technology, ii) Technology for Removing Algae Plume (TRAP) and Improving
   Transparency, iii) Mosaic technology and Macrobionics, iv) Technology of
   Immobilized Nitrogen Cycle Bacteria (INCB), and v) Ecological floating
   island and 5 M-key taches, namely: a) Macrophyte, b) Microorganism, c)
   Mollusk, d) Macrobionics, and e) Management.
   The possibility of rapid decrease of pollutants loading into the lake in
   the next a few years is very low. The approach of dredging sediment is a
   costly one, but the theoretical analysis and the practices in Dianchi
   Lake and other lakes showd that it is neither the sufficient nor the
   necessary one for controlling eutrophication in lakes. Controlling
   Eutrophication by enhancing purification capacity in lakes might be the
   most cost-effective approach. The purification capacity in water body

Abstract = {{An international three-year village development- and research
   project{''}Heritage at Risk in Rural Europe{''} aims for enhancing rural
   development in small villages in three participating countries. Finland,
   Hungary and Ireland. With the expertise of the three participating
   architecture schools in Oulu. Budapest and Dublin, the aim is to
   generate architecture plans as a student work for the case villages
   according to their individual needs. Those planning task can be related
   to land use planning. supplementary building. renovation planning or for
   example new development. In addition to the architectural planning for
   village development, additional research work is focused on the factors
   that are impacting the landscape and built environment of rural regions
   in Europe the structural change has had an effect to the agricultural
   livelihoods as well as to physical structure of the villages.
   Consequently the characteristic features have begun to disappear.
   Finding ways within planning and land use, how to maintain the valuable
   built heritage that is still left in those villages while the built
   environment has become increasingly heterogeneous, can be considered as
   one of the main objectives of the project. It is relevant to try to find
   solutions, how small rural villages could maintain their identity and
   characteristics along the valuable built heritage, and how to turn it
   into an attraction factor and a source of welfare. Also the needs of
   different interest groups like agricultural industry and inhabitants are
   often in contradiction. which causes problems for example in land use
   managing. One aim of the research is to define the deficiencies in land
   use procedures, and especially focus on scrutinizing the methods of
   analysis of the built environment and develop the general tools of
   analysis in J land use planning. Through a comparative study, different
   methods of analysis. guidelines of land use and building regulations can
   be observed and as a concrete result, find better models which could be
   transferred into practise also in other countries.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Pages = {{409-423}},
Abstract = {{The link between `fire mosaics' and persistence of animal species is
   part of a prominent ecological/land management paradigm. This paradigm
   deals largely with the effects of fire on animals on the basis of
   individual events. The universality of the paradigm can be questioned on
   a variety of grounds, a major deficiency being the inability to deal
   with quantitative effects of recurrent fire (the fire regime). A
   conceptual model of fire-related habitat elements is proposed for
   exploration of a continuum of species/habitat/landscape/fire regime
   combinations. This approach predicts that the dependence of species on
   fire-mediated habitat heterogeneity will be highly variable and strongly
   context-dependent. A spatially explicit simulation model was used to
   examine the persistence of malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) in a specific
   landscape/habitat context where dependence on fire-mosaics should be
   high. Results suggest that persistence of L. ocellata populations will
   be dependent on intervention using small patchy fires but that there is
   an optimum rate of intervention. Results were sensitive to spatial
   pattern of prescribed fire, landscape type (topography) and probability
   of wildfire. Underlying effects of the fire-interval distribution (the
   `invisible' mosaic) on plant species and habitat account for these
   results. A management emphasis on species/landscape context and
   awareness of the `invisible' mosaic is advocated.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term forest landscape dynamics are determined by a set of driving
   forces including large-scale natural disturbances, land-use, the
   physical environment, and stand-scale succession processes. Landscape
   models have an important role as tools for synthesizing existing
   information and making projections of possible future vegetation
   dynamics on large spatial scales. However, current landscape models
   cannot readily be used to study: (1) the change from weakly to strongly
   disturbed landscapes; (2) the impact of changing climatic parameters on
   landscape-scale dynamics; and (3) the effects of such changes on
   vegetation structure. Using European mountain forests as a case study,
   this paper focuses on improving the well-established LANDIS landscape
   model so that it can be applied to study these research questions.
   We integrated a simple tree succession sub-model in LANDIS, which
   incorporates quantitative descriptions of forest structure, and included
   sub-models to capture the influences of competition as well as climatic
   and edaphic parameters on tree population dynamics.
   The new model was subjected to a number of quantitative tests against
   measured data. It accurately predicted the altitudinal distribution of
   vegetation properties under managed as well as unmanaged conditions in
   the Dischma valley (Switzerland), and it provided realistic and accurate
   patterns of vegetation recovery following wind disturbance events, in
   spite of the very simple model formulations.
   To demonstrate the utility of the added detail, we applied the model in
   scenario mode under a range of changes in climatic and disturbance
   parameters, assuming a continuation of the current management regime.
   The simulations showed that the various driving forces have quite
   different effects on different species, and that their combined effect
   differs from one scenario to the next. Notably, there are few models
   that integrate forest growth and succession with disturbance dynamics in
   a semi-mechanistic manner. Our version of LANDIS achieves this
   integration based on simple concepts and methods that do not require
   many parameter estimates. We conclude that the new model has the
   potential to provide an integrated picture of the impacts of both direct
   and indirect effects of climate change on forest landscape dynamics. (C)

   needed for investigating how different actual or potential disturbance
   regimes determine the structure and dynamics of forest landscapes. We
   propose a new approach to bridge the forest stand and landscape

   landscape level, we develop a submodel of stand-level forest dynamics
   that responds to the landscape-level processes in a spatially explicit
   landscape model. Compared to the LANDIS model that we used as a starting
   point, our approach incorporates, in a spatially explicit and
   quantitative manner: (1) stand-level prediction of basal area and tree
   volume, and (2) seed dispersal, and sexual and asexual regeneration.
   Stand development is partly based on growth tables given as model input
   which means that stand submodel behavior is constrained within a
   reasonable range. We tested the approach in simulating the development
   of mixed boreal forests of Quebec, Canada. The simulations demonstrate
   that stand dynamics can be calibrated to match specific targets and that
   responses to changes in the initial conditions are realistic. This new

Abstract = {{Conventional physics is of little help in describing how ecosystems
   develop. Imbalances in material and energy usually equilibrate at rates
   that are much faster than changes in the internal structural constraints
   occur. Quantifying and following these internal constraints, therefore,
   constitutes the primary task for those who would describe ecodynamics.
   Many of the internal constraints link the biotic elements that
   constitute the ecosystem, and such connections often form self-entailing
   cycles. The combination of contingent behavior with auto-referential
   constraints engenders decidedly non-mechanical behaviors in ecosystems.
   It is impossible to treat explicitly all the hidden constraints in
   anecosystem, and so an implicit phenomenological approach, akin to what
   is donein thermodynamics is attempted. The network of material or energy
   exchanges in the ecosystem is used as a surrogate to record all the
   effects of the hiddenconstraints. The attributes of this network can be
   quantified with the help of information theory, and the ensuing measures
   appear to provide an adequate description of whole system development.

Abstract = {{Predicting species occurrence using a modelling approach based on a
   geographic information system (GIS) represents a new methodological tool
   which can be used to endorse conservation policies, on condition that
   models are tested for reliability.
   Habitat suitability models are often used to predict species occurrence
   through the modelling of proper environmental variables. A major
   constraint in building large-scale models of species distribution is the
   availability of data and therefore the deductive approach is adopted.
   This approach is suitable for bio-diversity assessment as it can be
   applied to a great number of species, it does however require
   statistical validation, both to test the accuracy of the input
   information and to deal with presence data (often affected by high
   spatial and temporal variability).
   Available data are, in the large majority, represented by a small sample
   collected without an ad hoc sampling design and without information on
   species absence. Reliable information on absence is not easily obtained
   with animal species due to elusive behaviour, poorly accessible habitats
   and their activity patterns. Therefore, absence data are to be
   considered ambiguous. Hence the need to develop statistical tools to
   deal with presence-only data. Moreover, presence data are rarely
   geo-referenced with high precision. Often information on species
   presence is spatially degraded as referred to polygon within which the
   exact species location cannot be recovered. Consequently, the validation
   procedure should statistically consider this uncertainty.
   In this paper we suggest that a compositional procedure be used when
   presence-only data are affected by strong spatial and temporal
   variability, and that a multinomial (based) procedure be used when
   presence-only data are geo-referenced with high precision during an ad
   hoc field survey. The two procedures have been tested on a large number
   of deductive models built to represent the distribution of vertebrate
   species in Italy. Results show that both procedures allow the assessment
   of the calibration properties of the models. The reliability of the two
   methods is confirmed by a model rejection pattern, determined by
   ecological factors, scale issues, spatial accuracy and sample size. Both
   procedures have a wide range of applications being threshold
   independent. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   three tropical butterfly data-sets for spatial structure in the vertical

   tropical forest butterfly communities that varies little through time

   there is evidence that the degree of vertical structure may vary among

Abstract = {{The increasing popularity of brown bear (Ursus arctos) viewing at Brooks
   River in Katmai National Park, Alaska has resulted in overcrowded
   facilities, increasing bear-human conflicts, displacement of bears from
   important habitats, and degradation of cultural resources. To partially
   address these issues, the National Park Service (NPS) constructed a
   300-m-long elevated boardwalk with interconnected viewing platforms in
   August 2000. To determine what effects the new structures might have on
   individual bears, we observed bear movements and behaviors before and
   after construction. We used direct observations and motion-detection
   cameras to construct temporal-spatial profiles of bear activity.
   Although bear numbers were similar (59 bears in 2000 and 56 bears in
   2001) and bear activity within the greater Brooks River area did not
   differ (P = 0.62, n = 29) between the 2 years of this study, trail
   crossings in the vicinity of the new structures decreased 78\% (7,436
   crossings in 2000 and 1,646 crossings in 2001; x(2) = 762, df = 14, P <
   0.001). Bear temporal use of the boardwalk area changed such that when
   human use was highest, bear use was proportionally lower in the post-
   versus pre-construction phase (x(2) = 34, df = 3, P < 0.005). Of 123
   direct observations of bears approaching to pass beneath the structures,
   only 19.5\% rerouted or avoided crossing under the structures. Bears'
   responses to the new structures were influenced by the behavior of
   visitors upon the structures. Potential management tools to minimize
   impacts of these structures on bears include enhanced public education
   regarding visitor conduct on the boardwalk, as well as visitor
   management and monitoring.}},

Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the economic impacts of urban land use transformation has
   become complex and acrimonious. Although community planners are
   beginning to comprehend the economic trade-offs inherent in transforming
   the urban fringe, they find it increasingly difficult to analyze and
   assess the trade-offs expediently and in ways that can influence local
   decision making. New and sophisticated spatial modeling techniques are
   now being applied to urban systems that can be used for assessing the
   probable spatial outcomes of given communal policies. Applying an
   economic impact assessment to the probable spatial patterns can provide
   to planners the tools needed to quickly assess scenarios for policy
   formation that might ultimately help inform decision makers.
   This paper focuses on the theoretical underpinnings and the practical
   application of an economic impact analysis submodel developed within the
   Land Use Evolution and Impact Assessment Modeling (LEAM) environment.
   The conceptual framework of LEAM is described, followed by an
   application of the model to the assessment of the cost of urban sprawl
   in Kane County, Illinois. The high spatial resolution of the approach
   allows for discerning the macro-level implications of micro-level
   behaviors. The results show, that spatially explicit dynamic modeling
   has various conceptual advantages over other approaches to modeling
   urban dynamics, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view.
   However, model validation and the assessment of the uncertainty of
   large-scale spatial dynamic models deserve considerable future
   attention. The implications of land use change decisions on individual
   and communal costs are discussed and ways to improve the methodology are
   outlined. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The extension of transgene technology to pasture species presents new
   challenges for ecological risk assessment because, unlike most crops,
   pasture plants are well adapted for persistence in mixed plant
   communities and are an important source of invasive species worldwide.
   Despite this, the impact of transgenic pasture plants on native
   ecosystems remains relatively unstudied. Here we use a community
   gradient modelling approach to investigate the performance of
   subterranean clover containing a nutrition-enhancing transgene over a
   range of ecologically important grassland communities at a study site in
   south-eastern Australia. Our data, which were collected over a full
   annual growing season, show that the transgenic clover line has
   different seedling survival and seed dormancy breakdown rates than the
   commercial non-transgenic line, which suggests that transgenic
   populations will decline faster than non-transgenic ones in perennial
   native grassland communities but could, under optimal climatic
   conditions, have potentially higher growth rates in grazed annual
   grasslands. These results demonstrate that changes to ecologically
   important demographic parameters can occur in plants containing
   transgenes that are not typically considered fitness enhancing, and that
   genotype by environment interactions and management regimes that impact
   on these parameters may influence the invasiveness of transgenic plants.
   Our study also demonstrates the utility of incorporating plant community
   gradient modelling into ecological risk assessment protocols designed
   for transgenic pasture plants.}},

Abstract = {{Although studies of population genetic structure are very common,
   whether genetic structure is stable over time has been assessed for very
   few taxa. The question of stability over time is particularly
   interesting for frogs because it is not clear to what extent frogs exist
   in dynamic metapopulations with frequent extinction and recolonization,
   or in stable patches at equilibrium between drift and gene flow. In this
   study we collected tissue samples from the same five populations of
   leopard frogs, Rana pipiens, over a 22-30 year time interval (11-15
   generations). Genetic structure among the populations was very stable,
   suggesting that these populations were not undergoing frequent
   extinction and colonization. We also estimated the effective size of
   each population from the change in allele frequencies over time. There
   exist few estimates of effective size for frog populations, but the data
   available suggest that ranid frogs may have much larger ratios of
   effective size (N-e) to census size (N-c) than toads (bufonidae). Our
   results indicate that R. pipiens populations have effective sizes on the
   order of hundreds to at most a few thousand frogs, and N-e/N-c ratios in
   the range of 0.1-1.0. These estimates of N-e/N-c are consistent with
   those estimated for other Rana species. Finally, we compared the results
   of three temporal methods for estimating N-e. Moment and
   pseudolikelihood methods that assume a closed population gave the most
   similar point estimates, although the moment estimates were consistently
   two to four times larger. Wang and Whitlock's new method that jointly
   estimates N-e and the rate of immigration into a population (m) gave
   much smaller estimates of N-e and implausibly large estimates of m. This
   method requires knowing allele frequencies in the source of immigrants,
   but was thought to be insensitive to inexact estimates. In our case the
   method may have failed because we did not know the true source of
   immigrants for each population. The method may be more sensitive to
   choice of source frequencies than was previously appreciated, and so
   should be used with caution if the most likely source of immigrants
   cannot be identified clearly.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how climate can interact with other factors in determining
   patterns of species abundance is a persistent challenge in ecology.
   Recent research has suggested that the dynamics exhibited by some
   populations may be a non-additive function of climate, with climate
   affecting population growth more strongly at high density than at low
   density. However, we lack methodologies to adequately explain patterns
   in population growth generated as a result of interactions between
   intrinsic factors and extrinsic climatic variation in non-linear
   systems. We present a novel method (the Functional Coefficient Threshold
   Auto-Regressive (FCTAR) method) that can identify interacting influences
   of climate and density on population dynamics from time-series data. We
   demonstrate its use on count data on the size of the Soay sheep
   population, which is known to exhibit dynamics generated by nonlinear
   and non-additive interactions between density and climate, living on
   Hirta in the St Kilda archipelago. The FCTAR method suggests that
   climate fluctuations can drive the Soay sheep population between
   different dynamical regimes-from stable population size through limit
   cycles and non-periodic fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{1. Describing and understanding patterns in biological diversity along
   major geographical gradients is an important topic in ecology. Samples
   collected from a large number of physically and chemically comparable
   stream sites along a 4000 m gradient of altitude in the Andes of Ecuador
   served to characterise patterns of family richness of aquatic
   macroinvertebrates at the scale of the stream site (local) and at that
   of discrete altitudinal zones.
   2. Both mean local and zonal family richness decreased by about 50\%
   from sea level to 4000 m a.s.l. Local richness declined linearly, while
   zonal richness remained constant from sea level up to a threshold
   altitude of about 1800 m, whereafter it decreased.
   3. From sea level to 1800 m few families were lost from zonal richness
   and few were gained. From 1800 to 3800 m the decrease in the number of
   families was accounted for by a loss of families present in lowland
   streams, with few new families gained. Hence, there was relatively
   little turnover of families along the entire gradient.
   4. The diverging pattern of local and zonal richness was caused by
   sporadically occurring families inflating zonal richness at
   mid-altitudes. If the sporadic families were represented by the same
   species found commonly in the lowlands, then the mid-altitudinal zonal
   richness would be maintained by a `rescue effect'. More probably,
   however, the sporadically occurring families found at mid-altitudes are
   each represented by new species replacing each other along the gradient,
   the families progressively diminishing in species richness and
   occurrence as the overall temperature tolerance of the family is
   approached.
   5. This study demonstrates that spatial scale affects altitudinal
   patterns in the taxonomic richness of stream invertebrates. It also
   showed that family-level identification can facilitate interpretation of
   sources and sinks of biodiversity along geographic gradients.}},

Abstract = {{Recreational hunting is the primary management tool used by natural
   resource agencies to control ungulate populations. Although free-ranging
   ungulates have been studied extensively in North America, relatively
   little is known about the field behavior of hunters or the factors that
   influence hunting behavior, except on small study areas where access is
   limited and controlled. We developed 3 integrated protocols to estimate
   hunter density, distribution, movements, habitat use, characteristics,
   and attitudes, which can be used on large areas with unrestricted
   access. We described how aerial surveys, in conjunction with distance
   sampling techniques and a Geographic Information System (GIS) database
   of landscape characteristics, provide estimates of hunter density and a
   map of hunter distribution and habitat use. We used Global Positioning
   System (GPS) units issued to hunters to systematically record hunter
   locations. Hunters also completed a simple questionnaire. We linked
   these data and used them to obtain detailed information on habitat use,
   movements, and activity patterns. Whereas aerial surveys are limited to
   discrete points in time and relate only to aggregations of hunters, data
   collected on hunters that carry GPS units can be used to study habitat
   use and distribution at different times of day for individual hunters.
   Finally, linked responses from a traditional mail or telephone survey to
   hunter location data collected via GPS units to assess how hunter
   characteristics (e.g., age, physical condition, attitudes) were related
   to field behavior. We applied these techniques during a white-tailed
   deer (Odocoileus virginianus) hunting season on a large tract (45,749
   ha) of public land in Pennsylvania, USA, with unrestricted hunter
   access. We estimated density of 7 hunters/1,000 ha (95\% CI: 4.2 to
   10.3) in the morning and 6.3 hunters/1,000 ha (95\% CI: 3.5 to 10.0) in
   the afternoon. We found that hunter density was negatively related to
   distance from roads and slope. Most hunters preferred stand hunting,
   especially in the early morning hours (0600-0800 hr; 72\% stationary);
   more walked or stalked in the afternoon (1400-1600 hr; 58\% stationary).
   The average maximum distance hunters reached from a road open to public
   vehicles was 0.84 km (SE = 0.03), and they walked an average of 5.48 km
   (SE = 0.193) during their daily hunting activities. We believe that the
   approaches we used for studying hunter behavior will be useful for
   understanding the connections between hunter attitudes and behavior and
   hence will allow managers to predict hunter response to changes in
   harvest regulations. Furthermore, our methods are more accurate than
   requesting hunters to self-report where they hunted. For example, we
   found that hunters reported that they walked >2.5 times farther from the
   nearest road ((x) over bar = 2.23 km, SE = 0.13) than actual distance
   recorded via GPS units ((x) over bar = 0.84 km, SE = 0.03). Our research
   provides wildlife managers with new knowledge on several levels. At the
   most basic level, we learned a great deal about what hunters actually do
   while in the field, rather than simply what they report. Second, linking
   field behavior with hunter characteristics will provide insights into
   the likely effects of changing hunter demographics. Finally, linking
   these data with traditional human-dimensions research topics, such as
   attitudes toward hunting regulations, may allow managers to better
   forecast the potential effects of regulation changes on hunter
   distribution and effort.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal changes in the magnitude of research findings have recently

   attributed to the delayed publication of non-significant results and
   disconfirming evidence. Here we introduce a method of cumulative
   meta-analysis which allows detection of both temporal trends and
   publication bias in the ecological literature. To illustrate the
   application of the method, we used two datasets from recently conducted
   meta-analyses of studies testing two plant defence theories. Our results
   revealed three phases in the evolution of the treatment effects. Early
   studies strongly supported the hypothesis tested, but the magnitude of
   the effect decreased considerably in later studies. In the latest
   studies, a trend towards an increase in effect size was observed. In one
   of the datasets, a cumulative meta-analysis revealed publication bias
   against studies reporting disconfirming evidence; such studies were
   published in journals with a lower impact factor compared to studies
   with results supporting the hypothesis tested. Correlation analysis
   revealed neither temporal trends nor evidence of publication bias in the
   datasets analysed. We thus suggest that cumulative meta-analysis should
   be used as a visual aid to detect temporal trends and publication bias
   in research findings in ecology in addition to the correlative approach.}},

Abstract = {{Many external effects of land use change are based on modifications of
   lateral flows of soil, water, air, fire or organisms. Lateral flows can
   be intercepted by filters and thus the severity and spatial range. of
   external effects of land use change is under the influence of filter
   effects. Wherever lateral flows are involved, research results cannot be
   simply scaled on an area basis, and overall impact does not follow
   simple linear causal relationships. This complexity has consequences for
   relationships amongst the primary agents who initiate or exacerbate
   external effects, other stakeholders who are affected by them and
   policymakers who attempt to mitigate problems that reach sufficient
   visibility in society. In this paper we review how the relative
   importance of lateral flows and filter effects differs among a number of
   externalities, and the implications this has for research methods. If
   flows and filters are incompletely understood, policies may be based on
   fallacies. Whereas `fire-breaks' act as filters in the lateral flow of
   the high temperature pulse of a fire, smoke from land-based fires can be
   intercepted only by rainfall acting as a filter and the external impact
   of smoke is determined by the atmospheric conditions governing lateral
   flow and chemical transformations along the pathway. Causal relations in
   smoke and haze problems are relatively simple and may form a basis for
   designing policy interventions to reduce downwind damage. For
   biodiversity issues, landscape connectivity, the absence of filters
   restricting dispersal and movement of organisms, is increasingly
   recognised as an influence on the dynamics of species richness and its
   scaling relations. Biodiversity research methods can extend beyond the
   current descriptive stage into clarifying causal relations with a
   lateral flow perspective. The question whether connectivity is in fact
   desired, however, depends on stakeholder interests and situation. Forest
   functions in watershed protection, presumably leading to a continuous
   flow of clean water in the dry season through the subsoil instead of a
   rapid surface transfer, have been generally attributed to the trees
   rather than the forest, with its rough surface structure, swamps and
   infiltration sites. A new synthesis of site-specific hydrological
   knowledge and tree water balance studies may be needed to separate myth
   from reality, and avoid wasting public funds on tree planting under the
   heading, of reforestation, without restoring the hydrological regime of
   a real forest. Soil movement can be intercepted at a C 9 41 range of
   scales and in as far as soil transport entails movement of soil
   fertility, filter zones can be very productive elements of a landscape.
   To achieve `integrated natural resource management' all external effects
   of land use will somehow have to be taken into account in farmer
   decision making about the use of natural resources on and off farm'.
   Farmers ecological knowledge may include concepts of lateral flows and
   should be further explored as an integral part of a new landscape
   ecological approach. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive agriculture has resulted in the loss of biodiversity and the
   specialist flora and fauna associated with the semi-natural grasslands
   of low-intensity pastoral systems throughout northwest Europe.
   Techniques employed to restore and re-create these grasslands on
   agricultural land in the UK are reviewed. Extensive cutting and grazing
   management have been shown to diversify improved swards and facilitate
   re-colonisation on ex-arable soils, although rates of re-assembly of
   plant communities with affinity to existing semi-natural grasslands have
   generally been slow. On former agriculturally improved swards, nutrient
   depletion has accelerated this process, especially where ``gaps{''} for
   establishment have been created. Similarly, on ex-arable soils
   ``nutrient stripping{''} and sowing with diverse seed mixtures has led
   to the rapid development of species-rich swards. On free draining brown
   earths such an approach may be required to restore grassland communities
   where soil phosphorous concentrations exceed semi-natural levels by more
   than 10 mg/l (using Olsen's bicarbonate extractant). However, the
   appropriateness of this threshold for other soil types requires further
   sampling. Although restored grasslands are likely to contribute to
   national biodiversity targets success will ultimately depend on the
   reinstatement of the communities and ecological functions of
   semi-natural references. Although this is technically feasible for a few
   plant assemblages, less is known about the re-assembly of microbial and
   faunal communities, or the importance of trophic interactions during
   grassland succession. As a consequence, more research is required on the
   functional attributes of semi-natural grasslands, as well as the methods
   required to restore localised types, novel nutrient depletion
   techniques, the ``phased{''} introduction of desirable but

Abstract = {{In degraded ecosystems where the impact on wildlife and the destruction
   of natural systems is high, restoration becomes a critical component of
   recovery. Monitoring restoration activities plays a key role in
   determining end points for restoration and assessing effectiveness.
   Appropriate monitoring of major systems, particularly in assessing
   vegetation reestablishment and slope stabilization, requires a long-term
   commitment to annual assessment of change and improvement over time.
   However, intrinsic factors built into government or public management
   systems, such as budgeting and staffing limitations, limit the ability
   for long-term monitoring of critical restoration projects. In the
   research reported in this article, we devised and assessed a new remote
   method for assessing restoration success and tested it on restoration
   and monitoring requirements in Lyell Island, British Columbia. We
   developed a system (the oblique data fusion system {[}ODFS]) to extract
   spatial information from oblique aerial video imagery. The ODFS enables
   low-cost change detection and database updates at a range of operational
   scales. System tests show an absolute spatial accuracy on the order of
   +/-2.1 m. The evaluation, based on digitized historical data, ground
   surveys, and the ODFS-derived data, indicates that the landslide rate
   (new area/year) tapered off following treatment; after 5 years it had
   been reduced by a factor of 3 relative to the background rate. The
   recovery is deemed sufficient to initiate secondary restoration tasks.
   The evaluation demonstrates the accuracy and utility of the ODFS for
   long-term monitoring of landscape restoration efforts, particularly in
   remote areas. In conclusion, this new innovative method shows
   considerable promise for park managers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple stochastic model of the dynamics of

   social behavior. I illustrate the fit of the model to field observations
   of 39 aggregations observed when they were not at equilibrium and
   outline a procedure for determining which parameters, and hence which
   behaviors, are constant across the 39 aggregations. A comparison of the
   predicted variablity in the model's parameter estimates, assuming
   constant parameter values for all 39 aggregations, to the observed
   variablity in the estimates suggests that waterfowl aggregation dynamics
   are affected by changing movement rates and not changes in group size:
   simulations reveal that the estimates of the arrival and departure rates
   are more variable than expected. In contrast, the estimates of the
   parameters describing movement group size do not show excessive
   variability. The fit of a constant parameter modified-geometric
   distribution to the group size data indicates that the formation of

Abstract = {{The state of a landscape is primarily reflected by its soil nutrients

   important ecological implications. The impacts of evolving landscapes in
   the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin of northwest China on soil
   organic C and N losses were assessed by both quantitative and computer
   modelling methods. In the period 1987-1997, patch transitions of the
   region's evolving landscapes have been predominantly characterized by a
   farmland expansion of 1.5 . 10(3) km(2), and the desertification of
   15.12\% of existing farmlands into desert. As the result of such

Abstract = {{The spatial pattern of light gaps in mesic grasslands in central Texas
   with contrasting disturbance histories was assessed using patch-based
   landscape metrics determined from a threshold level (25\% of full
   sunlight), as light intensities below this threshold substantially
   decrease survival of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa
   Torr.) seedlings. The spatial pattern of light gaps, with the exception
   of edge density, were significantly different between annually-disturbed
   and non-disturbed grasslands on all sample dates (2 April, 30 April, 29
   May, and 26 June 1998). Differences in patch metrics did not occur
   between nondisturbed grasslands despite contrasting vegetation
   composition {[}perennial forbs and perennial bunch (tussock) grasses].
   Patch-based landscape metrics of light gaps did vary temporally in both
   annually-disturbed and non-disturbed grasslands. The structure and
   spatial configuration of light gaps were distinctly different between
   annually-disturbed and non-disturbed grasslands: a low density of large
   patches characterized light gaps in annually-disturbed grassland,

   Our findings demonstrate that the current disturbance regime is the
   principal environmental driver influencing species dominance and
   composition, and indirectly vegetation structure, which collectively
   contribute to the observed dynamics of light gap patches in these mesic
   grasslands. Incorporating spatially explicit consideration of light gap
   structure and dynamics into experimental studies addressing invasion of
   weedy plant species such as honey mesquite may be an effective approach
   to address mechanisms and the ecological significance of disturbance
   operating as a driver facilitating woody plant invasions in mesic

Abstract = {{Phylogenetics sometimes plays a major role in conservation planning,
   although there are still discussions about what to conserve, the
   evolutionary novelty revealed by adaptive process or the evolutionary
   potential expressed by neutral genetic divergence. I discuss the
   relationship between general models of phenotypic evolution and
   branch-length transformations used in phylogenetic diversity (PD)
   indices. Phylogenetic diversity based on molecular phylogenies will be
   satisfactory under a neutral model of evolution with constant divergence
   rates. If evolution of phenotypes occurs under stabilizing or
   directional selection, however, PD will overestimate and underestimate
   evolutionary diversity, respectively. I took into account phenotypic
   patterns in quantitative traits by finding ancestral states and, for
   each ancestral-descendent pathway, transforming branch length into
   amounts of phenotypic evolution before calculating PD. As an example, I
   applied the method in an evaluation of PD in the eight New World
   biodiversity hotspots. I based the evaluation on the phylogeny of
   terrestrial Carnivora and transformed and untransformed (time) branch
   lengths. In all hotspots, time-only PD values were larger than their
   respective phenotypic PD estimates, as expected if stabilizing selection
   drives most of body size evolution. Both PD estimates were highly
   correlated with species richness across the hotspots, but the priority
   ranks changed when loss of species restricted to one hotspot was
   considered. If phenotypic evolution usually occurs under stabilizing
   selection processes, conservation efforts and resources would be reduced
   and/or restricted to a few distinct species with high evolutionary
   rates, reflecting new adaptive peaks. This may be a liberal conservation
   strategy, however, compared with PD values calculated from
   time-calibrate supertrees or molecular phylogenies, and it is still
   necessary to understand how adaptive processes drive the evolution of
   complex phenotypes.}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{285-298}},

Abstract = {{A modelling framework for studying the combined effects of climate and
   land-cover changes on the distribution of species is presented. The
   model integrates land-cover data into a correlative bioclimatic model in
   a scale-dependent hierarchical manner, whereby Artificial Neural
   Networks are used to characterise species' climatic requirements at the
   European scale and land-cover requirements at the British scale. The
   model has been tested against an alternative non-hierarchical approach
   and has been applied to four plant species in Britain: Rhynchospora
   alba, Erica tetralix, Salix herbacea and Geranium sylvaticum. Predictive
   performance has been evaluated using Cohen's Kappa statistic and the
   area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, and a novel
   approach to identifying thresholds of occurrence which utilises three
   levels of confidence has been applied. Results demonstrate reasonable to
   good predictive performance for each species, with the main patterns of
   distribution simulated at both 10 km and 1 km resolutions. The
   incorporation of land-cover data was found to significantly improve
   purely climate-driven predictions for R. alba and E. tetralix, enabling
   regions with suitable climate but unsuitable land-cover to be
   identified. The study thus provides an insight into the roles of climate
   and land-cover as determinants of species' distributions and it is
   demonstrated that the modelling approach presented can provide a useful
   framework for making predictions of distributions under scenarios of
   changing climate and land-cover type. The paper confirms the potential
   utility of multi-scale approaches for understanding environmental
   limitations to species' distributions, and demonstrates that the search
   for environmental correlates with species' distributions must be
   addressed at an appropriate spatial scale. Our study contributes to the
   mounting evidence that hierarchical schemes are characteristic of
   ecological systems.}},

Abstract = {{Recent, worldwide amphibian declines have highlighted a need for more

   consistent in their ability to identify important covariates for each

   results emphasize the importance of estimating detection and occupancy

Abstract = {{Invasion by nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) often results
   in replacement of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) in the-inland
   western United States, but the underlying mechanisms are not well
   understood. We conducted a four-year removal experiment to test for
   population-level mechanisms (i.e., changes in recruitment, survival,
   emigration, and immigration) promoting invasion success of brook trout
   and causing decline of native Colorado River cutthroat trout (O. c.
   pleuriticus). We chose 700-1200 in segments of four small mountain
   streams where brook trout had recently invaded cutthroat trout
   populations, two each at mid elevation (2500-2700 m) and high elevation
   (3150-3250 m), and annually removed brook trout from two streams
   (treatments), but not the other two (controls). We used depletion
   electrofishing, two-way fish weirs, and mark-recapture methods to
   estimate abundance, movement, and survival of trout. At mid elevation,
   age-0 and age-1 cutthroat trout survived at 13 times and two times
   higher rates on average, respectively, where brook trout were removed.
   At high-elevation sites, recruitment of cutthroat trout failed despite
   brook trout removals, apparently because of cold water temperatures. In
   contrast, age-2 and older cutthroat trout survived at similar rates,
   whether brook trout were removed or not and regardless of elevation.
   Summer movement by cutthroat trout was unaffected by removal of brook
   trout. We conclude that brook trout depress cutthroat trout populations
   at mid elevation through age-specific biotic interactions that reduce
   juvenile cutthroat trout survival, whereas populations restricted to
   high-elevation sites by invasion continue to decline because an abiotic
   factor (low temperature) causes recruitment failure. In comparison,
   brook trout survived at the same or higher rates than same-aged
   cutthroat trout. High immigration by brook trout recolonized depleted
   segments, and may help sustain invasions in sink habitats where
   environmental conditions limit recruitment. In streams similar to those
   we studied, eradication of brook trout is likely necessary to eliminate
   the threat to native cutthroat,trout, but selective removal regimes that
   capture a high percentage of the brook trout population for least three
   consecutive years, repeated periodically, may permit cutthroat trout
   populations to persist with brook trout. To identify underlying
   mechanisms responsible for successful invasion by mobile, age-structured
   vertebrates such as stream fishes, experiments conducted at realistic
   spatial and temporal scales and including multiple age classes will be
   required.}},

Abstract = {{Convergence between species niches and biological traits was
   investigated for 88 Leucadendron taxa in the Cape Floristic region.
   First, niche separation analysis was performed to relate species' niche
   positions/breadths with bioclimatic gradients. These gradients of
   aridity, seasonality of water availability, heat, and cold stress
   explained almost all variation in niche distributions. Species present
   in zones of extreme aridity or temperature exhibited narrower niche
   breadths than species situated in moderate sites, suggesting that
   stress-tolerant species do not occupy broad environmental ranges.
   Second, species niche positions were related to selected biological
   traits. Species of and sites had significantly lower blade areas than
   did species of moist sites, confirming a functional trade-off between
   stress tolerance and productivity for leaf design. Species dispersal
   mode was correlated to species niche positions on the aridity gradient,
   suggesting allometrically determined correlations between leaf design
   and the design of reproductive structures. Species niche positions were
   also correlated with flowering traits, with species that initiate
   flowering in winter found under Mediterranean climate influence and
   species that initiate flowering in spring in sites with greater summer
   rainfall input. By interrelating species niche positions on bioclimatic

Abstract = {{Question: Current climate changes in the Alaskan Arctic, which are

   Location: Arctic tundra-boreal forest transition in the Alaskan Arctic.
   Methods: Along this gradient of increasing canopy complexity, we
   measured key vegetation characteristics, including community
   composition, biomass, cover, height, leaf area index and stem area
   index. We relate these vegetation characteristics to albedo and the
   partitioning of net radiation into ground, latent, and sensible heating
   fluxes.
   Results: Canopy complexity increased along the sequence from tundra to
   forest due to the addition of new plant functional types. This led to
   non-linear changes in biomass, cover, and height in the understory. The
   increased canopy complexity resulted in reduced ground heat fluxes,
   relatively conserved latent heat fluxes and increased sensible heat
   fluxes. The localized warming associated with increased sensible heating

Abstract = {{This study examined the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on

   determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide
   probes. The locations differed significantly in DOM composition and
   concentrations, ectoenzyme activity and bacterial community structure.
   We found that water source and, to a lesser extent, source of the
   inoculum significantly affected nearly all aspects of bacterial activity
   and community structure. A common inoculum grown in different waters
   often led to as much as a 2-fold difference in enzyme activities. When 2
   different bacterial communities were inoculated in the same water,
   community structure and the activity of some ectoenzymes remained
   different after several days. Other data also pointed to a dependence of
   ectoenzyme activity on community structure. Activity of several
   ectoenzymes covaried with the relative abundances of the 4 bacterial
   groups we examined (alpha-, beta- and gamma-proteobacteria, and
   Cytophaga-like bacteria); the highest correlation was between
   beta-proteobacteria and phosphatase activity. In multi-variate
   regression analyses, community structure explained a significant amount
   of the variation in rates of all ectoenzymes except 2 proteases. The
   abundance of Cytophaga-like bacteria was the dominant variable in the
   regression models for the activity of 3 ectoenzymes. These data suggest
   that DOM can affect the relative abundance of the major heterotrophic
   bacterial groups, and that the relative abundance of these groups could
   have an impact on DOM hydrolysis.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The local distribution of woody vegetation affects most functional
   aspects of semiarid landscapes, from soil erosion to nutrient cycling.
   With growing concern about anthropogenic climate change, it has become
   critical to understand the ecological determinants of woody plant
   distribution in semiarid landscapes. However, relatively little work has
   examined the determinants of local variation in woody cover. Here we
   examine water balance controls associated with patterns of tree cover
   density in a topographically complex semiarid woodland.
   Location Los Pinos Mountains, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge LTER,
   New Mexico, USA.
   Methods To explore the relationship between local water balance
   variation and tree cover density, we used a combination of
   high-resolution (1 x 1 m), remotely sensed imagery and quantitative
   estimates of water balance variation in space and time. Regression tree
   analysis (RTA) was used to identify the environmental parameters that
   best predict variation in tree cover density.
   Results Using six predictor variables, the RTA explains 39\% of the
   deviance in tree cover density over the landscape. The relationship
   between water balance conditions and tree cover density is highly
   contingent; that is, similar tree cover densities occur under very
   different combinations of water balance parameters. Thus, the effect of
   one environmental parameter on tree cover density depends on the values
   of other parameters. After tree cover density is adjusted for water
   balance conditions, residual variation is related to tree cover density
   in the neighbourhood of a particular location.
   Conclusion In semiarid landscapes, vegetation structure is largely
   controlled by water supply and demand. Results presented here indicate
   that localized feedbacks and site-specific historical processes are
   critical for understanding the responses of semiarid vegetation to

   arnhemica, at landscape and local scales. (2) To discuss causal
   processes in the flowering patterns of semelparous bamboos.
   Location The entire range of B. arnhemica, in the monsoonal, tropical,
   north-west of the Northern Territory of Australia, mostly along
   watercourses.
   Methods Landscape-scale flowering patterns were assessed by a
   combination of air, boat and ground survey in each year from 2000 to
   2002. Areas that flowered prior to 2000, and those in which no flowering
   occurred, were also recorded, and historic records collated. At local
   scales, initiation of flowering, rates of die-off, and subsequent
   germination densities of seedlings were quantified by ground-based
   counts.
   Results After an estimated 40-50 years of vegetative development, B.
   arnhemica flowered, seeded prolifically, then died. Flowering occurred
   synchronously within patches ranging from 0.002 to 3200 km(2). One or
   more patches flowered in successive years from 1996 to 2002, forming a
   temporally-structured but spatially-chaotic flowering wave that affected
   c. 80\% of the population. Synchronous flowering took the form of a
   flowering distribution in which over 95\% of clumps within a patch
   initiated flowering in a central year, most of the remainder flowering
   the year before or after. Along the Daly River, an exception was
   observed in which 56\% of clumps flowered in the peak year. Seedling
   densities were three orders of magnitude greater under clumps that
   flowered in the central rather than the leading year of the flowering
   distribution.
   Main conclusions Synchrony is argued to be the primal state in
   semelparous bamboos, promoted by intense selection acting on a
   endogenous (genetic or biological) clock whose influence largely
   overrides that of the environment. A flowering wave may develop within
   an initially synchronous population when stochastic events interact with
   the biological clock without permanently altering the clock setting,
   producing an off-set patch. Off-set groups may only survive if
   sufficient individuals are off-set by the same amount at the same time
   and in the same vicinity so as to produce a new synchronously-flowering
   patch. This could be driven by two processes. Inter-year climatic
   variation may alter the biological clock's perception of time, producing
   off-sets at local or regional scales or even affecting entire
   populations. Severe environmental pressures may also force one-off
   changes to flowering schedules, as suggested by a severe flood event
   prior to flowering on the Daly River. A dynamic hypothesis for a wider
   range of bamboo flowering patterns is proposed in which synchronous
   flowering is fragmented and disrupted over time but renewed by
   allochronic speciation and dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Land-cover changes in the Choptank basin were estimated for 1665-1820 by
   using historical socioeconomic data and crop-rotation models.
   Socioeconomic data (human population, output per laborer, and crop
   yields) were obtained from the literature, whereas crop-rotation models,
   based on historical records, represented how agriculture was practiced.
   Model parameters and output were validated with export records, census
   data, and other historical records, and model errors were estimated to
   be approximately 5\%. This approach indicated a sigmoidal pattern for
   conversion of primary forest to agricultural land by 1800. The initial
   time period, 1665-1720, was characterized by low-intensity tobacco and
   corn cultivation. Due to long fallows, the models indicated that there
   was little land in crops (approximately 5\% of the region), but larger
   areas of secondary forest occurred on former cropland (approximately
   15\%). Although primary forest de-creased, the initial result in the
   first 55 years was a low net rate of deforestation and occupation by
   low-intensity farms. However, after 1720, cropland expanded rapidly due
   to the use of wheat as a cash crop. From 1720 to 1775, primary and
   secondary forest rapidly disappeared, increasing agricultural land to
   60\% of the region. By 1800, approximately 80\% was estimated to be
   converted to agriculture, and little primary forest remained. After
   1800, the land needed for crops decreased due to improved management
   practices and crop yields, and some secondary forest on formerly cleared
   agricultural sites may have reappeared. We estimate that less than 150
   years of European colonization resulted in virtually complete
   agriculturalization of a primarily forested landscape.}},

Abstract = {{1. In this paper a new formulation of the self-thinning law for plant

   the new approach is explicitly to separate the equation of state (total

   2. Using the dynamical approach, an analytical expression for the
   self-thinning exponent is derived which shows that the self-thinning
   exponent follows a trajectory, but whenever the total is constant the
   self-thinning exponent must, by definition, = -1. Conversely, whenever
   the total varies the self-thinning exponent must, by definition, differ
   from -1. The underlying general principles of self-thinning trajectories
   are deduced.
   3. The new dynamic interpretations are general because they are
   independent of the details about how the changes in the number and mean

   species richness within families. (iv) To evaluate how differences among
   families regarding latitudinal gradients in species richness influence
   the latitudinal gradient in species richness of entire communities.
   Location Continental New World ranging from the northern continental
   United States (Iowa, 42degrees N) to eastern Paraguay (Canindeyu,
   24degrees S).
   Methods Data on the species composition of communities came from 32
   intensively sampled sites. Analyses focused on species richness of five
   of nine New World bat families. Multivariate analysis of variance and
   discriminant function analysis determined and described differences
   among temperate, subtropical, and tropical climatic zones regarding the
   species richness of bat families. Simple linear regression described
   latitudinal gradients in species richness of families. Path analysis was
   used to describe: (i) the direct effect of latitude on species richness
   of communities, (ii) the indirect effects of latitude on the species
   richness of communities through its effect on the species richness of
   each family, (iii) the relative effects of latitude on the species
   richness of bat families, and (iv) the relative contribution of each
   family to variation in the species richness of communities.
   Results Highly significant differences among climatic zones existed
   primarily because of a difference between the temperate zone and the
   tropical and subtropical zones combined. This difference was associated
   with the high number of vespertilionids in the temperate zone and the
   high number of phyllostomids in the tropical and subtropical zones.
   Latitudinal gradients in species richness were contingent on phylogeny.
   Although only three of the five families exhibited significant
   gradients, all families except for the Vespertilionidae exhibited
   indistinguishable increases in species richness with decreases in
   latitude. The Emballonuridae, Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae
   exhibited significant latitudinal gradients whereby the former two
   families exhibited the classical increase in species richness with
   decreasing latitude and the latter family exhibited the opposite
   pattern. Variation in species richness of all families contributed
   significantly to variation in the species richness of entire
   communities. Nonetheless, the Phyllostomidae made a significantly
   stronger contribution to changes in species richness of communities than
   did all other families. Much of the latitudinal gradient in species
   richness of communities could be accounted for by the effects of
   latitude on the species richness of constituent families.
   Main conclusions Ecological and evolutionary differences among higher
   taxonomic units, particularly those differences involving life-history
   traits, predispose taxa to exhibit different patterns of diversity along
   environmental gradients. This may be particularly true along extensive
   gradients such as latitude. Nonetheless, species rich taxa, by virtue of
   their greater absolute rates of change, can dominate and therefore
   define the pattern of diversity at a higher taxonomic level and eclipse
   differences among less represented taxa in their response to
   environmental gradients. This is true not only with respect to how bats
   drive the latitudinal gradient in species richness for all mammals, but
   also for how the Phyllostomidae drives the latitudinal gradient for all
   bats in the New World. Better understanding of the mechanistic basis of
   latitudinal gradients of diversity may come from comparing and
   contrasting patterns across lower taxonomic levels of a higher taxon and
   by identifying key ecological and evolutionary traits that are
   associated with such differences.}},

Abstract = {{1 Biological carbon sinks develop in mature ecosystems that have high
   carbon storage when these systems are stimulated to increase
   productivity, so that carbon gains by photosynthesis run ahead of carbon
   losses by heterotrophic respiration, and the stocks of carbon therefore
   increase. This stimulation may occur through elevated CO2 concentration,
   nitrogen deposition or by changes in climate.
   2 Sinks also occur during the `building' phase of high carbon
   ecosystems, for example following establishment of forests by planting.
   3 New methods have been developed to identify biological carbon sinks:
   ground based measurements using eddy covariance coupled with inventory
   methods, atmospheric methods which rely on repeated measurement of
   carbon dioxide concentrations in a global network, and mathematical
   models which simulate the processes of production, storage and
   decomposition of organic matter. There is broad agreement among the
   results from these methods: carbon sinks are currently found in
   tropical, temperate and boreal forests as well as the ocean.
   4 However, on a global scale the effect of the terrestrial sinks
   (absorbing 2-3 billion tonnes of carbon per year) is largely offset by
   deforestation in the tropics (losing 1-2 billion tonnes of carbon per
   year).
   5 The Kyoto Protocol provides incentives for the establishment of sinks.
   Unfortunately, it does not provide an incentive to protect existing
   mature ecosystems which constitute both stocks of carbon and (currently)
   carbon sinks.
   6 Incentives would be enhanced, if protection and nature conservation
   were to be part of any international agreement relating to carbon sinks.}},

Abstract = {{Heritage conservation and management of landscapes is evident in many
   recent European policies and national reports on the state of the

   present a landscape approach to the identification of localities with a
   high probability of possessing cultural heritage interests. The low
   proportion of sites registered in Norway (an estimated 20\%) combined
   with current rates of damage gives the location of archaeological sites
   and their vulnerability to land use change high priority. To optimise
   use of the results for landscape planning, the study describes analysis
   at two hierarchical scales: (1) the regional level-where the aim was to
   locate combinations of environmental resources suitable for human
   use-for application in strategic planning; and (2) the landscape
   level-where identifying and delimiting cultural environments for local
   planning was the aim. This paper focuses on one type of archaeological
   site, Bronze and Iron Age grave mounds. The project used geographic
   information systems (GIS) for the analysis and mapping of landscape
   characteristics that indicate zones with a high probability of
   possessing cultural heritage interest. These zones covered ca. 12\% of
   the forested areas of the region yet captured 94\% of the registered
   grave mounds. New fieldwork confirmed the presence of new sites in the
   zones identified. Results have increased our understanding of

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of. canopy trees in the temperate deciduous
   forests of the northeastern United States creates ``neighborhoods{''}
   that vary in species composition as well as understory features. These
   neighborhoods may affect the distribution and abundance of generalist
   small-mammal seed predators by creating spatial variation in the
   availability of food resources, protective cover, and interactions with
   competitors. Small-mammal distribution and abundance may then influence
   tree population dynamics through variation in seed predation and
   seedling establishment. To. determine if small-mammal activity patterns,
   seed survival, and seedling recruitment varied with neighborhood
   structure, we designed a study conducted at two habitat levels:
   canopy-tree neighborhoods, which reflected variation in seed production,
   and understory neighborhoods, which reflected differences in protective
   cover and interactions among animals. We live-trapped small mammals
   during the summer and fall of 1995 and 1996, experimentally measured
   seed survival in the falls of 1995 and 1996, and quantified total tree
   seedling recruitment in the spring of 1997. We developed a new method
   for nonlinear Poisson regression to relate canopy and understory
   neighborhood composition to small-mammal distribution and activity,.
   seed survival, and seedling establishment. Small-mammal activity
   patterns changed between 1995 and 1996 in response to seed production.
   Canopy tree neighborhoods were a good predictor of overall small-mammal
   activity, and neighborhoods with high small-mammal activity had low seed
   survival. The canopy-tree neighborhoods with sufficient, seed rain and
   high seed survival displayed increased seedling recruitment. Understory
   structure was a poor predictor of seed survival and seedling recruitment
   but appeared to be the primary axis along which habitat partitioning
   among mammal species took place when population densities were low. This
   study demonstrates that small-mammal seed predators influence tree
   recruitment patterns through their actions as seed predators in
   temperate deciduous forests, and that local effects of small mammals on
   seedling recruitment can be predicted from the species composition of
   tree neighborhoods.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To determine the geographical variation in serotiny in a common New
   Zealand shrub as a contemporary indicator of past fire regimes. The
   distribution of serotiny could then be used to explore factors limiting
   the spread of fire-dependent vegetation.
   Location South Island, New Zealand.
   Methods Serotiny was assessed as the proportion of closed capsules on a
   shoot of standard stem diameter for 5-35 plants in 45 widely scattered
   populations of Leptospermum scoparium. Site characteristics, including
   locality, altitude, rainfall, habitat type and minimum burnable area
   were recorded at sampling sites.
   Results Serotiny was distributed bimodally within and among populations
   with capsules either mostly closed or mostly open. There was
   considerable geographical variation in capsule behaviour, most of which
   we attribute to variation in fire history. In wetlands and other sites
   unsuitable for forest growth, populations were all serotinous above a
   minimum area of 30 km(2) and nonserotinous below this threshold. In
   grassy habitats in the drier eastern areas, most populations were
   serotinous. The nonserotinous exceptions occurred in areas thought to
   have been cleared of forests by Polynesian settlers before the arrival
   of Europeans or in areas with numerous barriers to fire in the form of
   large rivers, floodplains, glaciers and barren mountain tops.
   Conclusions we suggest that serotiny in L. scoparium is a reflection of
   a long history of fire in the South Island. As such, it provides a
   contemporary signature of a past fire regime. Landscape barriers to the
   spread of fire were major obstacles limiting the spread of serotiny and
   associated fire-dependent vegetation. Rivers, lakes, glaciers, and
   sparsely vegetated floodplains prevented the spread of fire in high
   rainfall regions more than the lack of dry weather. People, by igniting
   fires in small open areas seldom struck by lightning, could radically
   increase the importance of fire on islands.}},

Abstract = {{Successional changes in the animal community of a temporary pond on the

   changes in hydrological factors (pond drying, water turnover) and to
   seasonality, whereas the 2(nd) phase corresponded to more stable
   hydrological conditions. Five successional phases could be distinguished
   on the basis of biomass-size spectra with similar structure. These
   phases were consistent with variations over time of parameter c of
   Pareto Model I. The 3 middle phases (II, III, and IV) identified using

Abstract = {{Here we describe a practical, step-by-step primer to scale-dependent

   important but often neglected topic in ecological studies because only a
   few statistical techniques appear to detect temporary features
   accurately enough. We introduce here the SDC analysis, a statistical and
   graphical method to study transitory processes at any temporal or
   spatial scale. SDC analysis, thanks to the combination of conventional
   procedures and simple well-known statistical techniques, becomes an
   improved time-domain analogue of wavelet analysis. We use several simple

   transitory features, to compare SDC and wavelet analysis, and finally we
   analyze some selected ecological series to illustrate the methodology.
   The SDC analysis of time series of copepod abundances in the North Sea
   indicates that ENSO primarily is the main climatic driver of short-term
   changes in population dynamics. SDC also uncovers some long-term,
   unexpected features in the population. Similarly, the SDC analysis of
   Nicholson's blowflies data locates where the proposed models fail and
   provides new insights about the mechanism that drives the apparent
   vanishing of the population cycle during the second half of the series.}},

Abstract = {{In response to changing public values and scientific knowledge, the
   variable-retention (VR) approach to forest harvesting has become
   widespread on forest lands in coastal British Columbia (BC). Variable
   retention is both a tool for achieving stand-level objectives, such as
   retention of trees to enhance structural diversity, and an important
   strategy for achieving forest-level goals, such as conservation of
   biodiversity. The VR approach can be applied using the new retention
   silvicultural system, officially adopted in BC, or by adapting
   traditional systems with long-term reserves.
   Weyerhaeuser's BC Coastal Timberlands is implementing an innovative
   forest management strategy that includes the use of landscape zoning,
   variable retention and adaptive management to balance ecological, social
   and economic objectives. The program includes monitoring of both
   operational cutblocks and operational-scale experiments. A set of
   long-term, variable-retention adaptive management (VRAM) experiments
   were designed by a team of scientists and foresters to address many of
   the questions regarding the layout and objectives for VR cutblocks.
   Fifteen VRAM blocks are being installed by our BC coastal operations
   over a 7-year period. There are three replicates of five comparisons:
   group retention level, group size, dispersed retention level, riparian
   retention level, and short- or long-cycle group selection. Each VRAM
   block consists of five 20 ha treatments: three VR options, clearcut, and
   uncut. To date, four VRAM sites have been logged and four are scheduled
   for completion in 2004. Monitoring includes a focused set of attributes
   and organisms. An adaptive management framework was designed so that

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{535-542}},
Abstract = {{Recent biodiversity experiments have investigated the relationship
   between diversity and ecosystem functioning by synthesizing plant
   communities from pools of species that have been experimentally
   manipulated to vary numbers and types of species present while holding
   abiotic factors constant. Biodiversity experiments therefore focus on a
   previously under-explored aspect of global change: the feedback from
   diversity to environment. Consequences of random manipulation of species
   communities may not correspond well to those of specific extinction
   sequences observed in the past in response to extinction drivers that
   cause highly non-random loss. However, random manipulation provides a
   good starting point given that existing communities could undergo many
   alternative orders of species Loss in the future in response to a
   variety of different potential extinction drivers. Further, the effects
   of some extinction drivers are currently poorly understood and therefore
   difficult to predict (e.g. climate change) and it may be premature to
   dismiss the predictions of random scenarios as irrelevant to all real
   examples of species loss. The first generations of biodiversity
   experiments have provided valuable, and sometimes unexpected,
   discoveries about the general nature of the relationship between
   diversity and ecosystem functioning. These discoveries could not have
   been made using observational studies. We propose that different
   examples of extinction loss in the real or a potential future world form
   a continuum from situations where the results of the first-generation
   biodiversity experiments will be highly relevant to less relevant. At
   the one extreme are examples where the effects of biodiversity on
   ecosystem functioning will be overwhelmed by direct effects of the
   extinction driver on processes (e.g. chronic eutrophication). At the
   other extreme are situations where ecosystem processes are not strongly
   affected by direct effects of the extinction driver and where the
   effects of species toss on functioning may be more important (e.g.
   habitat fragmentation). Given the unprecedented uncertainty about the
   future of biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems, a general
   approach with randomly varying species pools was the right place to
   start in order to provide a general foundation. The new challenge is to
   test for effects of biodiversity on functioning in real-world examples
   of species loss. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mating systems are well known to influence the dispersing sex, but the
   magnitude of the sex-biased dispersal has not actually been measured,
   whereas many theoretical predictions have been made. In this study, we
   tested a new prediction about the coevolution between natal dispersal
   and sociality from a recent evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS)
   approach. From a comparative approach, we showed that, in agreement with
   the model, the male-biased dispersal increases with increasing level of
   sociality in polygynous ground-dwelling sciurids. In addition, the
   increase in male-biased dispersal with increasing sociality results from
   an increase in male dispersal rates, whereas female dispersal rates
   remain constant, contrary to what is expected from the ESS model.
   Although the mating system through the level of polygyny could act as a
   confounding factor, our results strengthen previous work that states
   that inbreeding avoidance plays a major role in the evolution of
   dispersal for the most social mammalian species.}},

Abstract = {{Artisanal fishery in the lagoon of Venice is a multi-target activity
   with an old tradition. It was the only fishing activity since a new one
   with most features of an industrial fishery flourished following the
   introduction of the Manila clam in 1983. To compare the two fishing
   activities, a set of ecosystem indicators (landings, catches, discards,
   biomass of the system, mean Trophic Level of the system and exergy)
   obtained by a model approach, was applied. The model used was a
   mass-balance model of the lagoon ecosystem developed with the software
   package Ecopath with Ecosim. The 73 scenarios obtained by changing the
   fishing effort of the two different fisheries were used to explore the
   impact of fishing activity on the ecosystem. The results showed that the
   two activities are strongly interrelated, even if they do not exploit
   the same resources, and that the mechanical clam harvesting is the
   driving force able to affect the ecosystem state fundamentally. All this
   produces a strong conflict between the two kinds of fisheries. The
   ecosystem and social optimisation depend mainly upon a reduction of clam
   fishery, while the optimisation of the economic aspects is strictly
   linked to the maintenance of this fishing activity.}},

Pages = {{673-682}},
Abstract = {{Most studies using demographic PVA models in a context of species
   restoration have concluded that rather than the rate of introduction,
   the total number of individuals released had the most important
   significant influence on the chance of success. In this article we use a
   genetic simulation model including deleterious and adaptive alleles to
   assess the impact of the method of release on the change in population
   mean fitness. We systematically compare a strategy that consists in
   releasing all individuals at the same time with a strategy that consists
   in staggering releases over a long period of time. Our results show that
   the former strategy is more beneficial for long-term fitness when
   considering advantageous genes only, while the latter is better when
   considering deleterious genes only. If deleterious and adaptive alleles
   are considered together, the best strategy depends then essentially on
   which of these types of alleles has the stronger influence on the change
   in total fitness. Although the relative contributions of the variance in
   total fitness due to adaptive and deleterious alleles may vary with the
   initial frequencies and the selective and dominance effects of these
   alleles, our results show that the optimal rate of release is mostly
   dependant on the expected long-term population size. Thus from a genetic
   view-point, the temporal release strategy of reintroduced populations
   should be considered with respect to their environment's carrying
   capacity.}},

Abstract = {{A holistic stochastic dynamic model was developed by focusing on the
   interactions between conceptually isolated key-components, such as local
   passerine guilds and changes in habitat conditions, in Mediterranean
   agroecosystems of the ``Terra Quente Transmontana region{''}
   (north-eastern Portugal). The ecological integrity of the typical
   patchwork of this region, with respect to land use, can be partly
   assessed by the observation of the occurrence of passerine guilds. These
   important indicators and state variables are the underlying database of
   our model. This model aimed the prediction of the ecological changes
   which can be expected when olive orchards are being intensified. The
   model proposed was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical
   procedure (stepwise multiple regression analysis) performed to
   discriminate the significant relationships between guild richness and
   environmental variables. Since this statistical analysis is static, the
   dataset recorded from the field included true gradients of habitat
   changes. The model parameters were estimated from the results of the
   stochastic treatment and from regional data regarding tendencies within
   the use of land. A period of 50 years was considered. The final model
   provided some basis to analyse the responses of passerine guilds to the
   environmental scenarios that will characterize the new agroecosystems of
   the re-ion. The model simulations were incorporated into a Geographical
   Information System (GIS) approach. The results of the simulation
   revealed a structural drift within the different guild richness in
   response to the expected gradient of habitat changes. The possible local
   extinction of several species within the less well-represented guilds,
   such as the steppe passerine species, may be associated with a
   predictable reduction in ecological integrity of the typical
   agroecosystems. Therefore, a new structure of the passerine communities
   indicates that future agroecosystems will diverge from the initial or
   actual ecological state. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   decreased carbon storage. Woody encroachment results in increased
   structural heterogeneity of the landscape, elevated carbon stores
   aboveground, and variable belowground carbon responses. Nitrogen
   accumulates under woody plants in both desertification and woody
   encroachment scenarios, but large-scale changes in nitrogen stocks and

Abstract = {{The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States,
   encompassed by a watershed extending 168,000 km(2) over portions of six
   states and Washington, D.C. Restoration of the Bay has been the focus of
   a two-decade regional partnership of local, state and federal agencies,
   including a network of scientists, politicians and activists interacting
   through various committees, working groups, and advisory panels. The
   effectiveness of the restoration effort has been mixed, with both
   notable successes and failures. The overall health of the Bay has not
   declined since the restoration was initiated in 1983, but many of the
   advances have been offset by the pressure of increasing population and
   exurban sprawl across the watershed. The needs of the Chesapeake Bay
   Program are many, but the greatest is accurate information on land cover
   and land use change, primarily to assess the implications for water
   quality, examine various restoration scenarios, and calibrate spatial
   models of the urbanization process. We report here on a number of new
   land cover and land use data products, and associated applications to
   assist vulnerability assessment, integrated ecosystem analysis, and
   ultimately Bay restoration. We provide brief overviews of applications
   to model new residential development, assess losses and vulnerability of
   resource lands, and identify the factors that disrupt the health of

Abstract = {{When flowering, leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) has conspicuous
   yellow-green bracts that are spectrally distinct from other vegetation
   and may be distinguished with hyperspectral remote sensing. In July
   1999, Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data were
   acquired in northeastern Wyoming, near Devils Tower National Monument.
   Using the reflectance spectrum of flowering leafy spurge, leafy spurge
   occurrence was determined using a new method of spectral mixture
   analysis, Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF). Ground reference data
   (146 sites) were obtained 2 weeks before and after AVIRIS overflight to
   test the classification accuracy of leafy spurge. For 3 land cover
   types: mixed prairie, riparian, and coniferous woodlands, the presence
   or absence leafy spurge was detected with an overall accuracy of 95\%
   using a 0.10 threshold for detection. Differences in classification
   thresholds resulted in a trade-off between false positives, pixels that
   were mapped as leafy spurge but did not contain leafy spurge on the
   ground, and false negatives, areas that had leafy spurge on the ground
   but were not mapped as leafy spurge. Detection of leafy spurge
   occurrence was best for mixed prairie and riparian cover types, and
   somewhat less successful for conifer woodlands because of interference
   from tree crowns and their shadows. The advantage of the MTMF technique
   is it allows automated processing of hyperspectral imagery to generate
   accurate maps of leafy spurge occurrence.}},

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-76}},
Abstract = {{Complex systems, such as landscapes, are composed of different critical
   levels of organization where interactions are stronger within levels
   than among levels, and where each level operates at relatively distinct
   time and spatial scales. To detect significant features occurring at
   specific levels of organization in a landscape, two steps are required.
   First, a multiscale dataset must be generated from which these features
   can emerge. Second, a procedure must be developed to delineate
   individual image-objects and identify them as they change through scale.
   In this paper, we introduce a framework for the automatic definition of
   multiscale landscape features using object-specific techniques and
   marker-controlled watershed segmentation. By applying this framework to
   a high-resolution satellite scene, image-objects of varying size and
   shape can be delineated and studied individually at their characteristic
   scale of expression. This framework involves three main steps: 1)
   multiscale dataset generation using an object-specific analysis and
   upscaling technique, 2) marker-controlled watershed transformation to
   automatically delineate individual image-objects as they evolve through
   scale, and 3) landscape feature identification to assess the
   significance of these image-objects in terms of meaningful landscape
   features. This study was conducted on an agro-forested region in
   southwest Quebec, Canada, using IKONOS satellite data. Results show that
   image-objects tend to persist within one or two scale domains, and then
   suddenly disappear at the next, while new image-objects emerge at
   coarser scale domains. We suggest that these patterns are associated to
   sudden shifts in the entire image structure at certain scale domains,
   which may correspond to critical landscape thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use and land-cover changes affect ecological landscape functions

   land-cover changes. We present a method to (i) characterise the major
   spatial-temporal processes of land-cover changes, (ii) identify the
   correlations between environmental attributes and land-cover changes and
   (iii) derive potential environmental drivers of land-cover changes in a
   German marginal rural landscape. The method was applied to study
   land-cover dynamics from 1945 to 1998 in the districts of Erda,
   Steinbrucken and Eibelshausen, situated in the marginal rural landscape
   of the Lahn-Dill Highlands, Germany. We employed land-cover data gained
   by the interpretation of multi-temporal aerial photographs. Various
   environmental variables were introduced into the analyses. We identified
   physical landscape attributes (elevation, slope, aspect, available water
   capacity and soil texture) and structural landscape dimensions (patch
   size, patch shape and distance between patch and nearest settlement).
   With the aid of GIS, K-means partitioning and canonical correspondence
   analysis, we investigated land-cover trajectory types, land-cover
   transitions at individual time intervals and their relationships to
   these environmental variables. Our results show that, between 1945 and
   1998, land-cover changes correlated with the physical attributes of the
   underlying landscape. On the other hand, the structural landscape
   dimensions correlated with land cover only in periods of minor
   land-cover changes (1972-98). Greater diversity of physical landscape
   attributes is correlated with greater land-cover dynamics. Besides the
   important influence of socio-economic factors, land-cover changes in the

Abstract = {{We used a combination of two models, DISTRIB and SHIFT, to estimate
   potential migration of five tree species into suitable habitat due to
   climate change over the next 100 years. These species, currently
   confined to the eastern half of the United States and not extending into
   Canada, are Diospyros virginiana (persimmon), Liquidambar styraciflua
   (sweetgum), Oxydendrum arboreum (sourwood), Pinus taeda (loblolly pine),
   and Quercus falcata var. falcata (southern red oak). DISTRIB uses a
   statistical approach to assess potential suitable habitat under
   equilibrium of 2 x CO2. SHIFT uses a cellular automata approach to
   estimate migration and is driven primarily by the abundance of the
   species near the boundary, forest density inside and outside of the
   boundary, and distance between cells. For each cell outside the current
   boundary, SHIFT creates an estimate of the probability that each
   unoccupied target cell will become colonized over 100 years. By
   evaluating the probability of colonization within the potential `new'
   suitable habitat, we can estimate the proportion of new habitat that
   might be colonized within a century. This proportion is low (< 15\%) for
   all five species, suggesting that there is a serious lag between the
   potential movement of suitable habitat and the potential for the species
   to migrate into the new habitat. However, humans could hasten the
   migration of certain species by physically moving the propagules,
   especially for certain rare species that are unable to move sufficiently
   through fragmented landscapes, or even more common species, e.g., beech,

Abstract = {{Recent research shows that land use history is an important determinant
   of current ecosystem function. In the United States, characterization of
   land use change following European settlement requires reconstruction of
   the original property mosaic. However, this task is difficult in
   unsystematically surveyed areas east of the Appalachian Mountains. The
   Gwynns Falls watershed (Baltimore, MD) was originally surveyed in the
   1600-1700s under a system of warrants and patents (commonly known as
   `metes and bounds'). A method for the reconstruction and mapping of
   warrant and patent properties is presented and used to map the original
   property mosaic in the Gwynns Falls watershed. Using the mapped mosaic,
   the persistence of properties and property lines in the current Gwynns
   Falls landscape is considered. The results of this research indicate
   that as in agricultural areas, the original property lines in the Gwynns
   Falls watershed are persistent. At the same time, the results suggest
   that the property mosaic in heavily urbanized/suburbanized areas is
   generally `reset.' Further, trends in surveying technique, parcel size,
   and settlement patterns cause property line density and property shape
   complexity to increase in the less urbanized upper watershed. The
   persistence of original patterns may be damping expression of
   heterogeneity gradients in this urban landscape. This spatial pattern of
   complexity in the original mosaic is directly opposite of hypothesized
   patterns of landscape heterogeneity arising from urbanization. The
   technique reported here and the resulting observations are important for
   landscape pattern studies in areas settled under unsystematic survey
   systems, especially the heavily urbanized areas of the eastern United

Abstract = {{The concept of driving forces is gaining increasing attention in
   landscape-change research. We summarize the state of the art of this
   field and present new conceptual and methodological directions for the
   study of driving forces of landscape changes. These new directions
   address four major challenges faced by landscape-change studies, i.e.,
   studying processes and not merely spatial patterns, extrapolating
   results in space and time, linking data of different qualities, and
   considering culture as a driver of landscape change. The proposed
   research directions include: studying landscape change across borders
   and transects, focusing on persistence as well as change, investigating
   rates of change, considering attractors of landscape change, targeting
   correlation and causality, and searching for precursors of landscape
   change. Based on established knowledge and the new approaches we outline
   a standard procedure to study driving forces of landscape change. We
   anticipate that our analytical and systematic approach increases the
   relevance of studies of landscape change for science as well as for the
   solution of real world problems.}},

   Pleuronectes platessa tagged with electronic data storage tags, and
   released in the southern North Sea, has yielded new insights into
   spatial and temporal variation in vertical activity (swimming). Here we
   describe migration-linked changes in vertical activity patterns observed
   from 31 plaice released between December 1993 and February 1997. Fish
   migrations of up to 220 d were reconstructed using the tidal location
   method. Analysis of the periodicity of activity revealed high levels of
   vertical activity during the southward spawning migration into Southern
   Bight and the eastern English Channel following release in December and
   January. We observed spatially varying, migration-linked changes in
   vertical activity, with a tidal pattern of vertical activity during the
   pre- and post-spawning migrations and a circadian period of rhythmicity
   in the spawning grounds. Circadian periodicity was dominant in 23 of 31
   individuals (74\%), 13 of which also demonstrated significant 12 h
   periodicity. The other 8 fish exhibited a dominant 25 h periodicity. A
   significant 336 h (14 d) rhythm was observed in the averaged population
   data, in phase with the spring-neap cycle, with periods of reduced
   activity associated with times of expected high tides. Our results
   provide important information about systematic changes in

   A novel Monte Carlo resampling method taking into account these aspects
   was proposed and its efficiency was evaluated. Power and error were
   relatively insensitive to the frequency assumed for missing alleles.
   Power to identify F(0) immigrants was improved by using large sample
   size (up to about 50 individuals) and by sampling all populations from
   which migrants may have originated. A combination of plotting genotype

Abstract = {{Negative effects of human presence and activities on breeding success
   and survival of many water bird species are well documented. The New
   Zealand dabchick (Poliocephalus rufopectus) is a protected endemic New
   Zealand grebe, confined to the North Island mainland and classified as
   vulnerable. A third of the total New Zealand dabchick population live on
   the lakes of the central volcanic plateau, where there is potential
   conflict between humans and dabchicks. We used data from two independent
   surveys describing the distribution of New Zealand dabchicks to
   investigate the effect that human-made structures (i.e. jetties and
   houses) and human recreational activities (i.e. boating) have on the
   numbers of New Zealand dabchick pairs, chicks and nests in the bays of
   Lake Rotoiti, Tarawera and Okareka. Our results suggest that human-made
   structures and recreational activities are not significantly affecting
   the numbers and distribution of New Zealand dabchick pairs or nests at
   this time. Furthermore, the number of human-made structures was
   positively correlated with the number of chicks in the sampled bays.
   Humans and dabchicks may be distributed similarly around the lakes
   because factors such as wind exposure and shoreline topography made
   certain sites preferable for both species. Alternatively, human-made
   structures may provide protected nesting environments and/or cover for
   chicks from predators, refuges from harassment by other bird species, or
   other benefits. Pairs may therefore be able to raise chicks to the
   fledging stage more successfully. However, little is currently known
   about dabchick life history or population dynamics. We recommend that a
   method of capturing and marking be developed so that further monitoring
   of behavioural and population changes can be carried out. It is also
   necessary to conduct research on how boats and human activities at
   jetties affect incubating dabchicks and their young during the nesting

Abstract = {{Earlier studies have developed models of carrying capacity to predict

Abstract = {{This paper seeks to present the methodological approach of a case-study
   at a local scale, in the south of Portugal, where the European Union
   Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has significant impacts in terms of
   environment, socioeconomic and landscape aspects.
   The municipality of Mertola is located in the south-eastern part of the
   Alentejo Region, in a marginal area in relation to socio-economic
   parameters and agricultural production. As in the region as a whole, the
   dominant land use system is the Montado in a diversified pattern, which
   has in the last decades been subject. to successive significant changes,
   raising questions as to future landscape quality, identity and the
   required management. As in other European rural areas, the
   transformations in agriculture and the productive function resulted in
   changes in the landscape, which have impacts also on other functions
   such as conservation, environment balance, recreation, life support and
   preservation of cultural identity. These other functions attract each
   day more attention as a possible set of alternatives uses in marginal
   areas of Europe, such as Mertola. This actual context requires thus a
   landscape management based on integrated policies for the rural world,
   following the new perspectives of the CAP but also based on a deep
   knowledge of local landscape dynamics and requirements for preservation
   of identity. This project intends to evaluate and understand:
   (a) the changes that have occurred in the municipality in the last
   decades; and
   (b) how they have affected landscape pattern and also people's
   perception and connections to this landscape identity.
   The intent is to build up proposals for a more integrated and locally
   adapted formulation of CAP objectives and instruments. This paper will
   present the changes in landscape pattern and character registered in the
   study area for the last decades, the interdisciplinary methodology
   adopted, as well as the results of the first phase of the project.}},

   associated with groundwater, waste disposal, and resource recovery.
   Although our view of this isolated ecosystem is restricted by
   technologies used to access samples, we are learning more about places
   where life thrives in the subsurface and where life is severely
   repressed. Until studies of hyperthermophiles provide different
   information, a thermal boundary to life exists at the 120degreesC
   isotherm. Other locations in the subsurface are barren where they are
   impoverished by low fluid flux to supply electron donors and acceptors
   or by limited pore space in which microorganisms can reside. Examples of
   such locations include deep vadose zones and igneous rock masses with
   limited fractures. In contrast, subsurface locations that show evidence
   of gaseous or liquid flux are the most likely to yield higher numbers of
   microorganisms. Locations that have marine and terrestrial hydrothermal
   convection cells, active methane venting, solid-liquid-gas phase
   change's, as well as zones of salinity and porosity contrasts are all
   examples of demonstrated or potential subsurface oases. Our ability to
   conceptualize and quantify the subsurface biosphere will be accelerated
   by new sampling tools and molecular characterization methods for

Abstract = {{The article represents a link between the concept of discrete
   description of the ontogenesis of plants and the cellular automata
   approach for the spatial-temporal modelling of plant population
   dynamics. The continuous process of individual plant development may be
   subdivided into several stages on the basis of morphological indicators
   reflecting functional importance of plants at different stages. The
   number and duration of age stages may vary from species to species,
   among life-forms within species, and under different environment
   conditions. The duration of age stages and the probability of transition
   from one stage to another for a given plant depend on the plant's
   neighbourhood pattern, the type of ontogenesis and the site conditions.
   Such data are available from numerous field studies.
   The presented approach allows simulation of a plant population as a set
   of cellular automata located on a plane. The age stages of these
   automata can be changed according to simple rules, which reflect the
   types of plant ontogenesis, different life spans of age states, and
   different sizes of plants in the neighbourhood. This approach is
   different from matrix models, which are usually used for this purpose,
   in that here we can directly simulate the role of space interactions in
   the population dynamics. We constructed some cellular automata models
   based on experimental data, which reflect the ontogenesis types and
   life-forms of plants. The models demonstrate that simple rules of plant
   development with simply defined local interactions lead to complicated
   dynamics. The results show new possibilities of applications of discrete
   simulation modelling for analysis of plant populations and community

Abstract = {{Identifying releases from suppression represents one of the most
   fundamental dendroecological procedures for quantifying forest
   disturbance histories. In tree-ring series, releases are typically
   defined as pulses in percent growth change that exceed a minimum
   threshold. Past methodologies have applied fixed growth-change
   thresholds that may overly generalize the ability of a tree to respond
   to a disturbance event. In this study, we develop a more precise method
   that scales each release by its maximum release potential as defined by
   prior growth rates, using an old growth hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L.)
   forest in central Pennsylvania as an example. On average, tree age,
   diameter, and crown class appear to influence the magnitude of release
   response. However, differences in release response between age,
   diameter, and crown classes are largely an artifact of the more
   fundamental relationship between release response and growth immediately
   prior to release. Specifically, maximum percent growth change declines
   at a steep, negative exponential rate as prior growth levels increase.
   Slow-growing hemlocks can exceed 800\% growth increases while
   fast-growing hemlocks do not exceed growth increases of 20\%. This
   negative exponential threshold, or boundary line,, represents the
   maximum percent growth change that is physiologically possible at a
   given level of prior growth. Thus, release potential is relative to
   prior growth rate. This relationship between prior growth and release
   potential is species specific and is demonstrated in 24 additional
   hemlock stands. We propose new criteria based on prior growth in which
   moderate and major releases are those falling within 20-49.9\%, and
   50-100\% of the boundary line, respectively. Effects of short, moderate,
   and long-term climate events are mitigated by the percent-growth-change
   calculation and the high growth-change threshold applied to slow-growing
   trees. In addition, we demonstrate that similar boundary lines occur in
   Pinus strobus L and Quercus prinus L., and interspecific variations in
   boundary line configuration reflect differences in understory tolerance.
   Overall, this approach provides a more theoretically sound and flexible
   approach to developing disturbance histories, and we believe it will
   ultimately have broad applications in a variety of forest types.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed to what extent and by what mechanisms plants of the tropical
   understory palm Chamaedorea elegans are able to mitigate the negative
   effects of defoliation on performance (i.e., plant size, total growth,
   leaf lamina growth, and reproduction) and how this is related to light
   availability. For this purpose we developed a new approach that allowed
   us to quantify the performance of defoliated plants relative not only to
   the performance of undamaged plants, but also relative to the estimated
   performance of hypothetical defoliated plants that do not exhibit any.
   mechanisms of compensatory growth. The latter provides a way to quantify
   the adaptive value of compensation with reference to a hypothetical
   noncompensating alternative state. C. elegans plants were grown in a
   greenhouse at two light levels (5\% and 16\% of natural daylight) and
   subjected to five defoliation treatments (a control and four levels of
   defoliation). Defoliation was repeated every three months. Growth
   analysis revealed that defoliated plants allocated considerably more
   mass to the production of leaf laminas (f(lam)) than control plants, at
   the expense of allocation to other organs, particularly reproductive
   structures. Average growth rates per unit leaf area (NAR) and per unit
   plant mass (RGR), both measured on the basis of above-ground mass,
   increased with the level of defoliation at high light but not at low
   light. We estimated that the increases in f(lam) and NAR enabled C.
   elegans to compensate for part of the potential loss in performance
   caused by defoliation, even in cases where their RGR values were lower
   than those of control plants. Sensitivity analysis indicated that
   changes in NAR contributed more to this compensation than f(lam), but
   the importance of f(lam) increased with defoliation level and with
   decreasing light availability. The degree of compensation was higher in
   the high- than in the low-light treatment, suggesting that the
   possession of traits associated with compensatory growth. may be more
   important in sunny than in shaded environments. The degree of
   compensation differed depending on the measure of performance.
   Defoliated plants fully compensated for the potential reduction in
   lamina growth but compensated for <20\% of estimated loss in
   reproductive output. Since survival of C. elegans plants appears to be.
   strongly associated with their total leaf area, the greater compensation
   for lamina growth is important in relation to population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing concern that available base cation pools in soil are
   declining in eastern North America and that some forests are approaching
   nitrogen (N) saturation due to the combined effects of acid deposition
   and harvesting. To assess these concerns, elemental mass balances for
   calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and N were conducted over a
   17-year period in a representative mixed hardwood forest (HP4) in the
   Muskoka-Haliburton region in central Ontario, Canada. On average, 76\%
   of the N measured in bulk deposition, which is a conservative estimate
   of total N deposition, was retained in HP4, with tree uptake accounting
   for over half of the retained N. Year-to-year variations in annual NO,
   export were affected by climate variations, although the low annual
   NO3-N concentrations (80-156 mug/L) suggest that HP4 is not approaching
   N saturation. Losses of Ca, Mg, and K in stream export plus accumulation
   in trees (more than 12 cm in diameter at breast height) exceeded inputs
   in deposition by 296, 76.2, and 53.6 kg/ha, respectively, over the
   17-year period. Inclusion of mineral weathering estimates obtained using
   PROFILE, zirconium (Zr) depletion, and total analysis correlation failed
   to balance Ca losses from HP4, and calculations indicate that between 98
   and 145 kg/ha (depending on mineral weathering estimate) was lost from
   the soil exchangeable pool between 1983 and 1999. These losses were
   supported by repeated field measurements, which showed that the
   exchangeable Ca concentrations and soil pH decreased over the 17-year
   period, particularly in the upper soil horizons. When mineral weathering
   estimates are included, mass balance calculations generally indicated
   that there was no net loss of Mg and K from HP4, which was confirmed by
   our soil measurements. At present, there is sufficient Ca in the soil
   exchangeable pool to sustain forest growth at HP4; however, continued
   losses of Ca due to leaching and harvesting at the present rate may
   ultimately threaten the health and productivity of the forest within
   just a few decades.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To determine the best-fit model of species-area relationships for
   Mediterranean-type plant communities and evaluate how community
   structure affects these species-area models.
   Location Data were collected from California shrublands and woodlands
   and compared with literature reports for other Mediterranean-climate
   regions.
   Methods The number of species was recorded from 1, 100 and 1000 m(2)
   nested plots. Best fit to the power model or exponential model was
   determined by comparing adjusted r(2) values from the least squares
   regression, pattern of residuals, homoscedasticity across scales, and
   semi-log slopes at 1-100 m(2) and 100-1000 m(2). Dominance-diversity
   curves were tested for fit to the lognormal model, MacArthur's broken
   stick model, and the geometric and harmonic series.
   Results Early successional Western Australia and California shrublands
   represented the extremes and provide an interesting contrast as the
   exponential model was the best fit for the former, and the power model
   for the latter, despite similar total species richness. We hypothesize
   that structural differences in these communities account for the
   different species-area curves and are tied to patterns of dominance,
   equitability and life form distribution. Dominance-diversity
   relationships for Western Australian heathlands exhibited a close fit to
   MacArthur's broken stick model, indicating more equitable distribution
   of species. In contrast, Californian shrublands, both postfire and
   mature stands, were best fit by the geometric model indicating strong
   dominance and many minor subordinate species. These regions differ in
   life form distribution, with annuals being a major component of
   diversity in early successional Californian shrublands although they are
   largely lacking in mature stands. Both young and old Australian
   heathlands are dominated by perennials, and annuals are largely absent.
   Inherent in all of these ecosystems is cyclical disequilibrium caused by
   periodic fires. The potential for community reassembly is greater in
   Californian shrublands where only a quarter of the flora resprout,
   whereas three quarters resprout in Australian heathlands. Other
   Californian vegetation types sampled include coniferous forests, oak
   savannas and desert scrub, and demonstrate that different community
   structures may lead to a similar species-area relationship.
   Dominance-diversity relationships for coniferous forests closely follow
   a geometric model whereas associated oak savannas show a close fit to
   the lognormal model. However, for both communities, species-area curves
   fit a power model. The primary driver appears to be the presence of
   annuals. Desert scrub communities illustrate dramatic changes in both
   species diversity and dominance-diversity relationships in high and low
   rainfall years, because of the disappearance of annuals in drought
   years.
   Main conclusions Species-area curves for immature shrublands in
   California and the majority of Mediterranean plant communities fit a
   power function model. Exceptions that fit the exponential model are not
   because of sampling error or scaling effects, rather structural
   differences in these communities provide plausible explanations. The
   exponential species-area model may arise in more than one way. In the
   highly diverse Australian heathlands it results from a rapid increase in
   species richness at small scales. In mature California shrublands it
   results from very depauperate richness at the community scale. In both
   instances the exponential model is tied to a preponderance of perennials
   and paucity of annuals. For communities fit by a power model,
   coefficients z and log c exhibit a number of significant correlations
   with other diversity parameters, suggesting that they have some
   predictive value in ecological communities.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread replacement of native species with cosmopolitan,
   nonnative species is homogenizing the global fauna and flora. While the
   empirical study of biotic homogenization is substantial and growing,
   theoretical aspects have yet to be explored. Consequently, the breadth
   of possible ecological mechanisms that can shape current and future
   patterns and rates of homogenization remain largely unknown. Here, we
   develop a conceptual model that describes 14 potential scenarios by
   which species invasions and/or extinctions can lead to various
   trajectories of biotic homogenization ( increased community similarity)
   or differentiation ( decreased community similarity); we then use a
   simulation approach to explore the model's predictions. We found changes
   in community similarity to vary with the type and number of nonnative
   and native species, the historical degree of similarity among the
   communities, and, to a lesser degree, the richness of the recipient
   communities. Homogenization is greatest when similar species invade
   communities, causing either no extinction or differential extinction of
   native species. The model predictions are consistent with current
   empirical data for fish, bird, and plant communities and therefore may
   represent the dominant mechanisms of contemporary homogenization. We
   present a unifying model illustrating how the balance between invading
   and extinct species dictates the outcome of biotic homogenization. We
   conclude by discussing a number of critical but largely unrecognized
   issues that bear on the empirical study of biotic homogenization,
   including the importance of spatial scale, temporal scale, and data
   resolution. We argue that the study of biotic homogenization needs to be
   placed in a more mechanistic and predictive framework in order for
   studies to provide adequate guidance in conservation efforts to maintain
   regional distinctness of the global biota.}},

Abstract = {{The capability of an oyster to respond to environmental stresses, such
   as periodically high summer temperatures, as well as disease or parasite
   infections, depends, in large measure, upon the viability and functional
   capability of haemocytes. Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) were
   subjected to a sudden increase in temperature from 20 to 28 degreesC for
   1 week, and several haemocyte functions were determined before and after
   the temperature elevation using the flow cytometer. Previously, we
   described the characterization of different haemocyte types using new
   and modified flow cytometric methods. In this report, we provide
   detailed protocols for flow cytometric methods to: (1) determine
   haemocyte aggregation using paired samples with or without an
   antiaggregant solution; (2) assess haemocyte viability using propidium
   iodide (PI); (3) quantify haemocyte phagocytosis with fluorescent
   microbeads; and (4) measure the respiratory burst response of individual
   haemocytes using 2,7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and
   zymosan to activate the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
   The temperature increase caused no significant change in haemocyte
   aggregation, although there was a trend of increasing aggregation in
   granulocytes and small granulocytes, but a slight decrease in
   hyalinocyte aggregation. Phagocytosis of all haemocyte types decreased
   after the temperature increase. Significantly higher percentages of dead
   haemocytes in all haemocyte types (attributable to a large increase in
   mortality of hyalinocytes, the most numerous cells) were found after the
   temperature increase, suggesting generally less capable immune function.
   Numbers of dead small granulocytes and granulocytes tended to decrease,
   but this was not statistically significant. Effects of temperature
   elevation upon respiratory burst were not statistically significant;
   however, a trend of increased ROS production after temperature elevation
   was consistent for all haemocyte types. Granulocytes, hyalinocytes, and
   small granulocytes showed increased production of ROS in the presence of
   zymosan; granulocytes showed the highest induced fluorescence. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Up to now there is a great lack of statistically reliable information on

   protected areas, biotopes of high value or rare species but on ``normal
   landscape{''}. It was designed in a way similar to the British
   Countyside Survey by the German Federal Statistical Office and the
   Federal Agency for Nature Conservation with support of private
   companies. Data collection in sample units is done by field survey after
   a previous interpretation of satellite images and aerial photographs.
   Detailed analysis of these primary data as well as the computation of
   main biodiversity indicators which are representative for the whole of
   Germany fill a great gap from a national point of view. The results are

Abstract = {{Similarity of dispersal behavior among siblings is common in
   vertebrates. However, little is known about the factors (genetic,
   prenatal, postnatal) generating this similarity. Here we analyzed
   potential influences on the dispersal patterns of multiple families of
   hatchling fence lizards, Sceloporus occidentalis. We captured near-term
   females from the field, incubated their eggs in the laboratory, measured
   various traits of the hatchlings and dams, and then released the
   hatchlings at a number of sites in nature. We recaptured hatchlings 5-6
   weeks later and measured the direct distance to the release site.
   Because we treated hatchlings (from eggs to release) randomly with
   respect to sibship, we eliminated the possibility that any observed
   sibling similarity in dispersal is merely an artifact of common
   postnatal influences. To analyze dispersal, we developed a new method
   that does not make an arbitrary choice of a threshold distance
   separating dispersers from nondispersers. We found a significant family
   effect on dispersal. We suspect that this family effect originates from
   genetic influences rather than from prenatal ones. Indeed, hatchling
   dispersal was remarkably unrelated to numerous traits (of clutches,
   mothers, or hatchlings) that might reflect prenatal effects. However, we
   did find that males were more likely to disperse than females, as
   predicted for polygynous species. Finally, characteristics of the
   release site did not appear to influence dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Great Britain's wintering coastal wader populations have been estimated
   for the period 1994/1995-1998/1999 from data provided from two sources:
   the Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) and the Non-estuarine Coastal Waterfowl
   Survey (UK-NEWS). New methodology for estimating the number of wintering
   waders is applied. It imputes (fills in) the value of missing counts
   before estimating the population size of each species as being the mean
   of the largest annual count made between November and March over the
   relevant 5-year period. This methodology has led to an 11\% larger
   estimate of the number of waders present on Great Britain's coasts than
   the traditional approach based on averaging just January counts over a
   5-year period, and it suggests that Great Britain's coastline supports
   ca.2.1 million waders. Updated values are presented from which site
   evaluations based on 1\% of the national population can be derived.
   Great Britain is of considerable international importance for waders. It
   holds > 25 and > 50\% of the flyway populations of nine and four species
   of wader, respectively, but for the first time since the start of
   monitoring in the early 1970s, the historical increase in the number of
   predominantly coastal waders wintering in Great Britain is coming to an
   end. Seven of the 14 species that have shown population changes of > 5\%
   since the last set of 1987/1988-1991/1992 population estimates have
   declined in numbers. The possible causes of the fluctuations in wader
   populations, such as climate change and changing nutrient inputs to
   coastal waters are discussed. There is an urgent need to identify the
   causative factors leading to these declines, and to use the new
   population estimates to identify new sites that should be afforded legal
   protection, an action that should help Great Britain maintain its
   internationally important wader populations. The decrease in the updated
   population estimate of Eurasian oystercatcher, for example, has made it
   possible to determine that 19 rather than 17 sites in Great Britain are

Abstract = {{Long-distance dispersal has many consequences. One of these is the speed
   with which a population can invade a new habitat. This invasion wave
   speed can be calculated from information on demography (in the form of a
   stage-structured matrix population model) and dispersal,(in the form,of
   a distribution of stage-specific dispersal distances). Wave speed
   complements population growth rate (lambda) as an index of population
   performance in conservation biology. Here we present a new. way to
   calculate the sensitivity of wave speed to changes in short- and long
   distance dispersal-indeed, to dispersal at any distance-using the order
   statistics of the dispersal distribution. This makes it possible to
   examine the effects of changing the distance dispersed by the
   longest-dispersing individual, the shortest, the median individual, etc.
   We apply the method to data on the Pied Flycatcher in the Netherlands,
   the Starling in the United States, and-the Sparrowhawk in England and
   the Netherlands. We find that wave speed is vastly,more sensitive to
   changes in the uppermost percentiles of the dispersal distribution than
   to changes elsewhere. The sensitivity results make it possible to carry
   out life table response experiment (LTRE) calculations, which quantify
   the contribution of demography, short-distance dispersal, and
   long-distance dispersal to interpopulation differences in wave speed. We
   find that 30\% of the difference in wave speed between the Pied
   Flycatcher and the Starling is due to demography and about 70\% to
   dispersal. Most of the dispersal effects come from the top 10\% of the
   dispersal distribution. In contrast, 86\% of the difference in wave
   speed between the two populations of Sparrowhawks is due to differences
   in demography, and about 14\% to differences in dispersal. Again, most
   of the dispersal effects are due to the upper percentiles of the
   dispersal distribution. The patterns revealed in the analysis of the
   four populations are very similar, suggesting that the dependence of
   wave speed on long-distance dispersal may exhibit common patterns of
   sensitivity and elasticity.}},

   predict distributions of other subspecies. In some cases, the ecological
   niche model inferred for one subspecies provides an excellent descriptor
   of other subspecies' ranges, whereas in other cases the prediction is

Abstract = {{Encroachment of the shrub Prosopis glandulosa Torn (honey mesquite) into
   semi-arid grasslands is a serious concern in the south-western United
   States, yet little is known about the long-term dynamics of the invasion
   process. We used ten high-resolution aerial and satellite images taken
   from 1936 to 1996 to track the population dynamics and spatial pattern
   of all P glandulosa greater than 2 in in diameter on a 75 ha area in
   southern New Mexico.
   Shrub cover and patch numbers increased froth 1936 to the 1970s, then
   stabilized at 43\% cover and 83 patches ha(-1). Individual patches were
   extremely persistent: 95\% of the area occupied by shrub patches in 1936
   was still occupied in 1996. Recruitment into the 2 in size class was
   more variable: 0.6-5.2\% year(-1) (mean 0-8\% year(-1)). Patch-shape
   complexity increased from 1936 to 1983 as adjacent shrubs merged, and
   then declined as those clusters filled in and became rounder. Spatial
   pattern of shrubs showed a distinct trend over time: strongly clustered
   in 1936 at lag distances up to 250 m, then random arrangement at all
   scales, and by 1983 pattern was regular at lag distances greater than
   100 m. There was no clear relationship with precipitation.
   The use of remote sensing imagery allowed us to examine one site over
   time, and revealed patterns in population dynamics and spatial pattern
   that would not have been visible otherwise. Comparison of field
   estimates collected in 2001 with 1996 image data suggest that the canopy
   cover estimates were accurate, but shrub densities were seriously
   underestimated in the satellite photographs, which do not show shrubs
   smaller than 2 m diameter. As long as limitations of the imagery are
   understood, these methods can be applied over a larger and more
   heterogeneous area to examine environmental correlates of invasion
   success. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{1 Classifying species by shared functional characteristics is important

   2 We investigated plant traits that determine the response of forest

   eight European countries and four North-eastern American states,
   comprising 20 field studies yielded information on 216 forest plant
   species. For these species, data on 13 life history traits were
   collected.
   3 Trait correlation structure was similar in the European and American
   data-sets and corresponded well to those described in the literature.
   The European and American herbs and the European graminoids were
   clustered into distinct emergent groups based on their plant traits. The
   profiles of the European and American emergent groups were similar.
   4 Herb species belonging to emergent groups characterized by low
   dispersability (i.e. large seeds, low fecundity, unassisted dispersal)
   were relatively slow colonizers. Dispersability (and not recruitment)
   seems to be a key factor limiting the colonization of some forest plant

Pages = {{49-65}},

Abstract = {{By numerical continuation of equilibria, we study a size-structured
   model for the dynamics of a cannibalistic fish population and its
   alternative resource. Because we model the cannibalistic interaction as
   dependent on the ratio of cannibal length and victim length, a cannibal
   experiences a size distribution of potential victims which depends on
   its own body size. We show how equilibria of the resulting
   infinite-dimensional dynamical system can be traced with an existing
   method for numerical continuation for physiologically structured
   population models. With this approach we found that cannibalism can
   induce bistability associated with a fold (or, saddle-node) bifurcation.
   The two stable states can be qualified as `stunted' and `piscivorous',
   respectively. We identify a new ecological mechanism for bistability, in
   which the energy gain from cannibalism plays a crucial role: Whereas in
   the stunted population state cannibals consume their victims, on
   average, while they are very small and yield little energy, in the
   piscivorous state cannibals consume their victims not before they have
   become much bigger, which results in a much higher mean yield of
   cannibalism. We refer to this mechanism as the `Hansel and Gretel'
   effect. It is not related to any individual `choice' or `strategy', but
   depends purely on a difference in population size distribution. We argue
   that studying dynamics of size-structured population models with this
   new approach of equilibrium continuation extends the insight that can be
   gleaned from numerical simulations of the model dynamics. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{When modelling real ecosystems, a number of techniques need steady state
   condition to proceed in their analysis. In ecosystem network models this
   means that energy entering the system exactly balances the output.
   Steady state, however, is not a straightforward outcome of network
   construction and, to have this condition satisfied, network analysis
   uses balancing procedure. This operation leads to restructuring the
   weighted network, changing the values of some network flows; this can
   affect drastically the results of the analysis. Presently, two
   algorithms are used for balancing ecosystem networks: input-based
   approach and output-based approach. In the former input flows are kept
   constant while outputs and transfer coefficients are manipulated; the
   latter requires that inputs and intercompartmental flows are modified.
   This paper discusses the effects of these algorithms on some products of
   network ana lysis, in particular system level indices such as total
   system throughput (TST) and ascendency. Also it suggests four new
   procedures that, while balancing the networks, can minimise changes on
   measured flows and distortion on results of the analysis. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Quantitative methods for the design of reserve networks often select

   extinctions can be expected in such reserves, especially if unprotected
   surrounding habitat is lost. A novel approach that deals with this
   problem is presented by considering factors such as habitat quality and
   spatial configuration of reserves during the selection process.
   Species-specific effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, together
   with habitat composition, are taken into account when computing species
   probabilities of local occurrence. Sites are then chosen to represent
   all species with a given target probability. The method is applied to a
   dataset of butterflies and moths from the Creuddyn Peninsula, North
   Wales, UK, which includes species with various responses to habitat
   quality and configuration. The results show that the resulting level of
   reserve clustering will depend on the number of species for which the
   spatial configuration plays an important role (at the scale under
   consideration), and on the pattern and amount of habitat loss that is
   expected to follow around the reserves. The method represents a step

Abstract = {{Many and and semiarid (dryland) regions are subject to desertification
   from intensive land-use pressures such as cattle ranching. However, the
   lack of quantitative approaches required to assess desertification has
   slowed our understanding of how vegetation and soils are changing in
   dryland regions. Using airborne high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy and
   field measurements, we developed the first regional assessment of
   vegetation structural and soil biogeochemical properties in the Monte
   Desert biome, Argentina. We evaluated the long-term impacts of grazing
   on vegetation cover and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage, which
   are core indicators of biogeochemical status and change in drylands. A
   comparative analysis was carried out on vegetation and soil properties
   in four major Monte Desert plant communities, as well as within the U.N.
   Nacunan Man-and- Biosphere Reserve and adjacent areas subjected to
   long-term grazing.
   The four dominant plant communities differed substantially in vegetation
   cover, leaf area index, foliar N concentration, and soil organic C and N
   stocks. Imaging spectroscopy with Monte Carlo spectral mixture analysis
   provided accurate estimates of fractional photosynthetic vegetation
   (PV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and bare soil cover at <5-m
   spatial resolution throughout a 763-km(2) region. Hotspots of grazing
   management (e.g., ranch centers, water sources) have undergone some
   woody vegetation encroachment, but the spatial patterns were localized
   and variable. More clearly, a widespread NPV decrease and bare soil
   increase was common outside of the reserve. Soil organic C and N stocks
   were highly correlated with PV + NPV cover fractions. Soil organic C and
   N storage was 25-80\% lower in areas subjected to long-term grazing, as
   compared to protected ecosystems within the Nacunan Reserve. Long-term
   grazing has depleted stores of C and N in soils and dramatically altered
   vegetation structure in the Monte Desert. A persistent lack of NPV due
   to grazing has likely impaired C and N cycles considered central to the
   biogeochemical functioning of the region. This study demonstrates a
   novel approach to remotely measure both surface and soil properties most
   indicative of progressive land degradation and desertification in
   dryland regions.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing by domestic livestock and changed fire regimes by humans have
   caused major changes in the productivity and composition of rangelands

   commonly observed loss of perennial forage species and the increasing
   abundance of woody plants. Grazing and fire-induced changes are
   difficult to predict from current process knowledge and are often too
   costly or time-consuming to investigate experimentally. We describe the
   development and use of ARENA, a new simulation model. A plant functional
   approach is used in which the relative growth rate, competitive ability
   and life cycle of the plant types are mainly defined by the plant's
   morphology and allocation pattern, plus its water-use efficiency and
   nitrogen concentration. The soil and plant types can be parameterized to
   a large extent with information from the literature, facilitating
   application in a broad range of dryland environments. The model has been
   tested for two soils and pasture communities in the seasonally dry
   tropics of the Victoria River District, N Australia. Predictions of
   pasture production and perennial grass fraction under undisturbed
   conditions agreed with observations in field exclosures. Predictions of
   maximum tree density also coincided with observations along a rainfall
   gradient. Simulation experiments were conducted to explore the effect of
   different stocking levels and fire management regimes on pasture

   1994/1995-1998/1999. These update the previous estimates for

   thresholds for waterbird species which in turn form the basis for the
   identification of nationally important wetland sites for subsequent
   conservation and protection. Estimates are also used to assess changes
   in numbers of those species for which monitoring data are insufficient
   to calculate annual indices of population change. Data for calculating
   the estimates come from a variety of sources including the Wetland Bird
   Survey (WeBS, a long-term scheme which counts waterbirds by day at
   wetlands), goose roost censuses, site-based surveys and published
   reviews. Generation of the estimates is made difficult by a number of
   methodological and data quality issues. To account for some of the
   methodological problems affecting WeBS data, new methods for generating
   estimates have been used which account for birds missed during the
   counts in a more comprehensive manner. These result in large increases
   in the estimated numbers for many of the relevant species, although most
   are still considered to be underestimates. To assess the biological
   change in numbers since the last assessment, estimates generated from
   the same methods used previously are also presented. These indicate that
   while the majority of species have experienced increases in numbers
   since the late 1980s there have been some notable declines. There is

Abstract = {{Aim This study assessed changes in diversity and assemblage composition
   in bryophytes and their associated invertebrates along altitudinal
   gradients in Australia and New Zealand. The importance of altitude in
   shaping these communities and for the diversity of both invertebrates
   and bryophytes was examined at different spatial scales, including
   local, altitudinal, regional and biogeographical.
   Location Samples were taken from four Australasian mountain ranges
   between 42degrees and 43degreesS: Mt Field and Mt Rufus, Tasmania,
   Australia, and Otira Valley and Seaward Kaikoura Mountains, South
   Island, New Zealand.
   Methods On both Tasmanian mountains, five altitudes were assessed (250,
   500, 750, 1000 and 1250 m). At each location (mountain/altitude
   combination) two sites were chosen and six samples were taken. Six
   altitudes were assessed on New Zealand mountains (Otira: 250, 500, 750,
   1000, 1250 and 1500 m; Kaikoura: 1130, 1225, 1325, 1425, 1525 and 2000
   m). Bryophyte substrate was collected, and all samples were stored in
   70\% ethanol. Invertebrates were extracted from bryophytes using
   kerosene-phase separation and all invertebrates were identified to
   family. At each location in Tasmania, all bryophyte species within six
   25-cm(2) grids per site were collected and identified to species.
   Bryophytes from New Zealand were identified to species from the
   invertebrate sample substrate because of sampling constraints.
   Results Altitude did have a significant effect on diversity, however, no
   general trend was found along the altitudinal gradient on the four
   mountains. There were distinct differences in diversity between
   biogeographical regions, mountains, altitudes and sites. In Tasmania, Mt
   Field had the highest diversity in invertebrates and bryophytes at 750
   m. In contrast, Mt Rufus had consistent low invertebrate and bryophyte
   diversity along the entire altitudinal gradient. There were also
   distinctive differences between locations in the composition of
   invertebrate and bryophyte communities in Tasmania. Along the two
   altitudinal gradients in New Zealand, Otira had highest diversity for
   both invertebrates and bryophytes at low altitudes, whereas Kaikoura had
   highest invertebrate and lowest bryophyte diversity at the highest
   altitude.
   Main conclusions There was an effect of altitude, however, there were no
   consistent changes in diversity or composition on the four different
   mountains. There was considerable local and regional variation, and,
   despite a strong sampling design, no underlying altitudinal trends were
   detectable. This study demonstrates the importance of examining a range
   of spatial scales if patterns in community structure along altitudinal
   gradients are to be studied. The implications of this study are
   discussed with reference to survey design, taxonomic resolution, climate
   change and conservation of habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Anecdotal historical and photographic evidence suggests that woody
   vegetation is increasing dramatically in some northern Australian
   savanna habitats. Vegetation change in savannas has important
   implications for pastoral land-use, conservation management, and
   landscape-scale carbon storage, and informs theoretical debates about
   ecosystem function. This study seeks to determine the nature, extent and
   cause(s) of woody vegetation change in a seasonally flooded alluvial
   savanna habitat.
   Location The study area is located within the seasonally inundated
   alluvial zone of the tidal portion of the Victoria River, Northern
   Territory, Australia. The study area has been grazed by domestic stock
   since c. 1900, prior to which the area was inhabited and more likely
   regularly burnt by Aboriginal people for thousands of years.
   Methods Digital georeferenced aerial photographic coverages were used to
   examine and quantify woody vegetation change between 1948 and 1993.
   Transect surveys of woody and herbaceous vegetation were carried out to
   ground-truth air-photo results and determine the nature and causes of
   observed vegetation changes.
   Results There has been a dramatic increase in woody vegetation cover
   throughout the study area. Vegetation change patterns are roughly
   uniform across the full range of edaphic habitat variation and are
   unrelated to the depositional age of fluvial sediments. Two woody
   species, Eucalyptus microtheca and Excoecaria parvifolia, are
   predominantly responsible for observed increases. Demographic analyses
   reveal that woody invasions have been episodic and indicate that in most
   locations peak woody species establishment occurred in the mid-1970s.
   Grasses are almost absent in a majority of habitats within the study
   area. Instead, large areas are covered by scalded soil, dense invasive
   weed populations, and unpalatable forbs and sedges. What grasses do
   occur are predominantly of very low value for grazing. The condition of
   the herbaceous layer renders most of the study area almost completely
   non-flammable; what fires do burn are small and of low intensity.
   Main conclusions Multiple working hypotheses explaining observed
   patterns of woody vegetation increase were considered and rejected in
   turn. The only hypothesis consistent with the evidence is as follows:
   (1) observed changes are a direct consequence of extreme overgrazing by
   cattle, most likely when stocking rates peaked in the mid-1970s; (2)
   prolonged heavy grazing effected the complete transformation of much of
   the herbaceous vegetation to a new state that is not flammable; and (3)
   in the absence of regular fire mortality, woody vegetation increased
   rapidly. The relatively treeless system that existed in 1948 was
   apparently stable and resilient to moderate grazing levels, and perhaps
   also to episodic heavy grazing events. However, grazing intensity in
   excess of a sustainable threshold has forced a transition that is
   irreversible in the foreseeable future. Stable-state transitions such as
   this one inform debates at the heart of ecological theory, such as the
   nature of stability, resilience, equilibrium and carrying capacity in
   dynamic savanna ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P), an essential nutrient for crop and livestock production,
   can accelerate freshwater eutrophication, now one of the leading water
   quality impairments in the United States. In response, the U.S.
   Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency
   proposed a new nutrient management policy, now addressing P as well as
   nitrogen (N), which each state must enact by 2008. There are three
   approaches that address P-agronomic soil test P recommendations,
   environmental soil test P thresholds, and a P index to rank fields
   according to their vulnerability to potential P toss. There are many
   versions of the P index now in use, demonstrating the robustness and
   flexibility of the indexing framework to better target remedial
   measures. Of the three P-based approaches, the P indexing approach has
   been most widely adopted with 47 states using this approach to target P
   management. This paper charts the development of the indexing approach,
   which ranks site vulnerability to P loss by accounting for source (soil
   test P, fertilizer, and manure management) and transport factors
   (erosion, runoff, teaching, and connectivity to a stream channel) and
   outlines modifications made among states that reflect local conditions
   and policy. Additional factors include flooding frequency, STP modifiers
   (texture, pH, P sorption, reactive aluminum {[}Al]), conservation
   practices, and priority of receiving waters. While computation of the
   final index value is additive in 20 states, 17 multiply source and
   transport factors to define critical source areas. Most states (47) have
   maintained the original indexing approach of assessing site
   vulnerability to P loss, with indices in three states quantifying P
   toss. We demonstrate using three management scenarios (changing the time
   of applied manure, riparian buffer establishment, and reduced feed P
   ration) that overall P index ratings can be decreased, giving farmers
   more options for manure management than by simply reducing application
   rates.}},

   pandanus tools. In 2000 we carried out an intensive survey in New
   Caledonia to establish the geographical variation in the manufacture of
   these tools. We documented the shapes of 5550 tools from 21 sites
   throughout the range of pandanus tool manufacture. We found three
   distinct pandanus tool designs: wide tools, narrow tools and stepped
   tools. The lack of ecological correlates of the three tool designs and
   their different, continuous and overlapping geographical distributions
   make it unlikely that they evolved independently. The similarities in
   the manufacture method of each design further suggest that pandanus
   tools have gone through a process of cumulative change from a common
   historical origin. We propose a plausible scenario for this rudimentary

Abstract = {{Forests of the northeastern United States are expected to serve as a
   substantial sink for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) as they recover from
   extensive clearing and agriculture. However, questions remain concerning
   the rate, distribution, and duration of this potential sink. We used a
   chronosequence approach to determine changes in ecosystem C and N,during
   the first 115 years of forest development after agricultural abandonment
   in Rhode Island, USA. All sites had similar soils, climate, land-use
   history, and dominant overstory vegetation (Pinus strobus), but-differed
   in time since agricultural abandonment. Total ecosystem C increased
   linearly across the chronosequence at. a mean rate of 2.10
   Mg.C-ha(-1).yr(-1). Most of the C was sequestered into plant biomass
   (73\%) with less stored in the forest floor (17\%) and deep mineral soil
   (6\%; 20-70 cm depth). Total ecosystem N did not change over time;
   instead N accumulated in the forest,floor (11.6 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1)) and
   plant biomass (4.1 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1)), and these increases were roughly
   balanced by a significant decrease in N content of. the mineral soil (-
   12.4 kg N.ha(-1)-yr(-1)). Over 90\% of the storage of C and N in plant
   biomass occurred in the bole wood (C:N 350). Since nearly two-thirds of
   the forests in Rhode Island have established since 1900, net ecosystem C
   storage will likely continue for the next century if these forests
   remain undisturbed. Our results show that wood biomass is an important
   sink for both C and N in regrowing forests for at least one century

Abstract = {{Globally, plant-pollinator communities are subject to a diverse array of
   perturbations and in many temperate and semi-arid systems fire is a
   dominant structuring force. We present a novel and highly integrated
   approach, which quantifies, in parallel, the response to fire of
   pollinator communities, floral communities and floral reward structure.
   Mt Carmel, Israel is a recognised bee-flower biodiversity hotspot, and
   using a chronosequence of habitats with differing post-fire ages, we
   follow the changes in plant-pollinator community organisation from
   immediately following a burn until full regeneration of vegetation.
   Initially, fire has a catastrophic effect on these communities, however,
   recovery is rapid with a peak in diversity of both flowers and bees in
   the first 2 years post-fire, followed by a steady decline over the next
   50 years. The regeneration of floral communities is closely matched by
   that of their principal pollinators. At the community level we quantify,
   per unit area of habitat, key parameters of nectar and pollen forage
   known to be of importance in structuring pollinator communities. Nectar
   Volume, nectar water content, nectar concentration and the diversity of
   nectar foraging niches are all greatest immediately following fire with
   a steady decrease as regeneration proceeds. Temporal changes in energy
   availability for nectar, pollen, total energy (nectar + pollen) and
   relative importance of pollen to nectar energy show a similar general
   decline with site age, however, the pattern is less clear owing to the
   highly patchy distribution of floral resources. Changes in floral reward
   structure reflect the general shift from annuals (generally low-reward
   open access flowers) to perennials (mostly high-reward and restricted
   access flowers) as post-fire regeneration ensues. The impact of fire on
   floral communities and their associated rewards have clear implications
   for pollinator community structure and we discuss this and the role of
   other disturbance factors on these systems.}},

Abstract = {{The role of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) such as the

   important, in the context of conservation management, during the last

   their opportunities and limitations. They are a means to resolve
   transboundary problems with neighbouring states and adopt harmonized
   approaches, they increasingly offer access to worldwide knowledge, tools
   and financial resources, and they can give conservation agencies a
   stronger mandate domestically. But they are specialized instruments
   focused on particular problems or sectors. The threats they address and
   the solutions they outline have to be evaluated in relation to overall
   environmental and socio-economic priorities. This entails linkages among
   different problems and sectors at various scales. Regional and
   ecosystem-level approaches are most appropriate for sorting out linkages

   build these abilities into international governance. Conservation

Abstract = {{Human disturbance in northeastern North America over the past four
   centuries has led to dramatic change in vegetation composition and
   ecosystem processes, obscuring the influence of climate and edaphic
   factors on vegetation patterns. We use a paleoecological approach on
   Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to assess landscape-scale variation in pitch
   pine-oak vegetation and fire occurrence on the pre-European landscape
   and to determine changes resulting from European land use. Fossil pollen
   and charcoal preserved in seven lakes confirm a close link between
   landform and the pre-European distribution of vegetation. Pine forests,
   dominated by Pinus rigida, were closely associated with xeric outwash
   deposits, whereas oak-hardwood forests were associated with landforms
   having finer grained soils and variable topography. In general, fire was
   much more abundant on Cape Cod than most other areas in New England, but
   its occurrence varied geographically at two scales. On the western end
   of Cape Cod, fires were more prevalent in pine forests (outwash) than in
   oak-hardwood forests (moraines). In contrast, fires were less common on
   the narrow and north-south trending eastern Cape, perhaps because of
   physical limits on fire spread.
   The most rapid and substantial changes during the past 2000 years were
   initiated by European settlement, which produced a vegetation mosaic
   that today is less clearly tied to landform: Quercus and other hardwood
   trees declined in abundance in the early settlement period in
   association with land clearance, whereas Pinus has increased, especially
   during the past century, through natural reforestation and planting of
   abandoned fields and pastures. An increase in fossil charcoal following
   European settlement suggests that fire occurrence has risen
   substantially as a result of forest clearance and other land uses,
   reaching levels greater than at any time over the past 2000 years.
   Although fire was undoubtedly used by Native Americans and may have been
   locally important, we find no clear evidence that humans extensively
   modified fire regimes or vegetation before European settlement. Instead,
   climate change over the past several thousand years and European land
   use over the past 300 years have been the most important agents of
   change on this landscape.}},

Abstract = {{State-and-transition models have received a great deal of attention
   since the introduction of the concept to range management in 1989.
   Nonetheless, only recently have sets of state-and-transition models been
   produced that can be used by agency personnel and private citizens, and
   there is little guidance available for developing and interpreting
   models. Based upon our experiences developing models for the state of
   New Mexico, we address the following questions: 1) how is information
   assembled to create site-specific models for entire regions, 2) what
   ecological issues should be considered in model development and
   classification, and 3) how should models be used? We review the general
   structure of state-and-transition models, emphasizing the distinction
   between changes among communities within states (pathways) that are
   reversible with changes in climate and ``facilitating practices{''}
   (e.g. grazing management), and changes among states (transitions) that
   are reversible only with ``accelerating practices{''} such as seeding,
   shrub control, or the recovery of soil stability and historical
   hydrologic function. Both pathways and transitions occur, so these
   models are complementary. Ecological sites and the climatically-defined
   regions within which they occur (land resource units) serve as a
   framework for developing and selecting models. We illustrate the
   importance of clearly delineating ecological sites to produce models and
   describe how we have dealt with poorly-delineated sites. Producing
   specific models requires an understanding of the multiple ecological
   mechanisms underlying transitions. We show how models can represent and
   distinguish alternative and complementary hypotheses for transitions.
   Although there may be several mechanisms underlying transitions, they
   tend to fall within discrete categories based upon a few, fundamental
   ecological processes and their relationships can be readily understood.
   A knowledge of, mechanisms is closely related to the use of ecological
   indicators to anticipate transitions. We conclude that models should
   include 1) reference values for quantitative indicators, 2) lists of key
   indicators and descriptions of changes in them that suggest an approach
   to a transition, and 3) a rigorous documentation of the theory and
   assumptions (and their alternatives) underlying the structure of each
   model.}},

Abstract = {{The founding of new populations by small numbers of colonists has been

   this idea. A large amount of background information on recent
   colonization history is available for one Zosterops subspecies, Z.
   lateralis lateralis , providing the opportunity to reconstruct the
   population dynamics of its colonization sequence. We used a Bayesian
   approach to combine historical and demographic information available on
   Z. l. lateralis with genotypic data from six microsatellite loci, and a
   rejection algorithm to make simultaneous inferences on the demographic
   parameters describing the recent colonization history of this subspecies
   in four southwest Pacific islands. Demographic models assuming
   mutation-drift equilibrium or a large number of founders were better
   supported than models assuming founder events for three of four recently
   colonized island populations. Posterior distributions of demographic
   parameters supported (i) a large stable effective population size of
   several thousands individuals with point estimates around 4000-5000;
   (ii) a founder event of very low intensity with a large effective number
   of founders around 150-200 individuals for each island in three of four
   islands, suggesting the colonization of those islands by one flock of
   large size or several flocks of average size; and (iii) a founder event
   of higher intensity on Norfolk Island with an effective number of
   founders around 20 individuals, suggesting colonization by a single
   flock of moderate size. Our inferences on demographic parameters,
   especially those on the number of founders, were relatively insensitive
   to the precise choice of prior distributions for microsatellite mutation
   processes and demographic parameters, suggesting that our analysis
   provides a robust description of the recent colonization history of the

Abstract = {{For some time now, ecological economists have been putting forward a
   `threshold hypothesis'-the notion that when macroeconomic systems expand
   beyond a certain size, the additional cost of growth exceeds the flow of
   additional benefits. In order to support their belief, ecological
   economists have developed a number of similar indexes to measure and
   compare the benefits and costs of growth (e.g. the Index of Sustainable
   Economic Welfare, ISEW, and the Genuine Progress Indicator, GPI). In
   virtually every instance where an index of this type has been calculated
   for a particular country, the movement of the index appears to reinforce
   the existence of the threshold hypothesis. Of late, a number of
   observers have cast doubt over the validity of these alternative

   a theoretical foundation to support the ISEW, the GPI, and other related

Abstract = {{Disturbance of forest ecosystems, such as that caused by harvesting or
   acid deposition, is thought to alter the ability of the ecosystem to
   retain nutrients. Although many watershed studies have suggested
   depletion of available calcium (Ca) pools, interpretation of ecosystem
   Ca mass balance has been limited by the difficulty in obtaining mineral
   weathering flux estimates. While many studies have suggested that
   weathering flux is insufficient to maintain available soil pools,
   measurements of concomitant changes in available soil pools are rare.
   Here, we critically examined application of the Ca:Na ratio method in
   interpreting the long-term. Ca budget of six northern hardwood watershed
   ecosystems at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, Woodstock, New
   Hampshire, USA. Storage of sodium (Na) in biomass and secondary minerals
   and on cation exchange sites was low enough so that net ecosystem Na
   loss was essentially equivalent to mineral weathering flux. Mineral
   chemistry and mass balance considerations constrained the Ca:Na ratio of
   weathering products to a sufficiently narrow range that spatial and
   temporal changes in the ecosystem Ca:Na ratio could be interpreted as
   changes in contribution of available Ca pools to ecosystem loss.
   Depletion of available Ca pools was greater in the three experimentally
   manipulated watersheds with aggrading biomass compared to three
   reference watersheds with relatively mature forest conditions. Although
   accelerated loss of Ca in the first few years following disturbance has
   been documented by prior studies, this study suggests that excess Ca
   loss continues for at least three decades after treatment, with no
   evident trend toward the conditions shown in the reference watershed. It
   is not likely that changes in previously quantified Ca pools account for
   this sustained loss, suggesting that a previously unstudied Ca pool or
   release. mechanism may be important in ecosystem response to
   disturbance. Possible sources include Ca oxalate, which is known to
   accumulate in forest soils, but has not been considered in the context
   of an ecosystem mass balance.}},

Abstract = {{1. Several genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops have
   cleared most of the regulatory hurdles required for commercial growing
   in the United Kingdom. However, concerns have been expressed that their
   management will have negative impacts on farmland biodiversity as a
   result of improved control given by the new herbicide regimes of the
   arable plants that support farmland birds and other species of
   conservation value.
   2. The Farm-Scale Evaluations (FSE) project is testing the null
   hypothesis that there is no difference between the management of GMHT
   varieties of beet, oilseed rape and maize and that of comparable
   conventional varieties in their effect on the abundance and diversity of
   arable plants and invertebrates. The FSE also aims to estimate the
   magnitude and consider the implications of any differences that are
   found.
   3. The experimental design of the FSE is a randomized block, with two
   treatments allocated at random to half-fields. The target sample is
   around 60-75 fields for each crop, selected to represent variation of
   geography and intensity of management across Britain. The experimental
   crops are managed by commercial farmers as if under commercial
   conditions.
   4. Biodiversity indicators have been selected from plants and
   terrestrial invertebrates to identify differences between crop
   management regimes that may result in important ecological changes over
   larger scales of space and time. Field sampling is at fixed points,
   mainly along transects from the field boundary, starting before the crop
   is sown and continuing into following crops.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The FSE is best considered as an
   investigation into the effects of contrasting crop management regimes on
   farmland biodiversity, rather than a study of the effects of genetic
   modification. It could become a model for future studies of ecological
   effects of the way we use and manage agricultural land.}},

   the predicted regional distribution of a vegetation type can be
   approximated by the distribution of its diagnostic species and vice

   ponderosa forest type widely distributed in the south-western USA.
   Results and main conclusions Pinus ponderosa and A. concolor models
   generally were judged to be successful. Quercus gambelii models were
   judged unsuccessful, which may result from the influence of variables
   not modelled, such as soil moisture, disturbance, biotic factors and
   other site limiting factors. Size classes differed in the range of
   environmental conditions associated with high occurrence probabilities
   within and between species, reflecting differences in the effects of
   climate variability and anthropogenic changes, such as fire suppression,
   on the distribution of each size class. Pinus ponderosa alliance was
   predicted to be distributed over a narrower range of environmental
   conditions than P. ponderosa species models, therefore limiting the use
   of this vegetation type as a surrogate for the distribution of the
   dominant species, and vice versa. Maps of combinations of environmental
   variables that produced a high probability of P. ponderosa occurrence
   showed that some landscapes predicted to contain the species exhibited
   diverse environmental conditions over short distances. The use of
   regional environmental relationships to characterize areas with high
   local environmental variability may facilitate identification of areas
   of potential rapid biotic change.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of Aoki's entropy production indices as ecological

   production per Surface unit rather than volume unit. which seem to be
   good ecological indicators for the trophic state of lake ecosystems. The
   positive correlation between these indices and the trophic state of a

Abstract = {{The present work was carried out in the framework of the Forest
   Territorial Plans (PFT) of Piemonte region (North-western Italy). These
   Plans considered the different components of the territory (forests,
   grasslands, natural vegetation) analysed by means of a forest inventory
   and land cover maps at 1:25.000 scale. The general aim of the project is
   to integrate the traditional survey with the Earth Observation
   techniques, developing a toot useful to produce land cover and forest
   maps and providing a reference base for monitoring the future changes. A
   part of this project focused on the possible use of high-resolution
   satellite images (Ikonos II) for verifying and updating the forest maps.
   In order to achieve such a goal a multispectral Ikonos II image was
   acquired on the study area, an hilly terrain with highly fragmented
   forest cover. A first phase of ground truth definition by means of
   specific surveys aiming at recognising the different spectral classes
   was then carried out. The following steps were the developing of a
   visual interpretation of the image and a supervised classification
   applying an object-based approach. The results of these procedures were
   compared with the forest map defined by means of aerial photos
   interpretation and ground survey. The experimental application of
   high-resolution satellite images to forest mapping showed that the
   different homogeneous areas in the image corresponded to the main
   differences in cover density and dominant tree species composition (oak,
   chestnut, etc.), but sometimes they also reflected differences in the
   average age and sylvicultural system (coppice, high forest) of the
   forest stands. Another important conclusion of the study is that per
   pixel classification methods are not suitable for automated analysis of
   Ikonos images and therefore a new approach, based on a preliminary
   segmentation of the image, is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Geomorphic processes in and regions are particularly sensitive to
   climatic variability. In this context, integrated studies are being
   conducted to understand the response of dust emission and deposition to
   climatic and land-use change in the and southwestern United States.
   Several approaches are taken to monitor wind erosion and characterize
   modem dust - its sources, flux, and composition - to document the
   potential for desertification under future climatic conditions. Wind
   erosion is monitored at ecologically sensitive sites, using
   meteorological stations that measure sand flux within the saltation
   layer. Dust deposition is also monitored at these and many other sites
   using different types of dust collectors. In addition, new remote
   sensing methods detect the location, frequency, magnitude, and duration
   of large dust-emission events. Remotely sensed images of vegetation
   change, combined with those that illustrate high soil reflectivity,
   complement dust-detection methods to identify areas especially
   susceptible to wind erosion. Dust trapped in collectors and in snow is
   characterized for its physical, mineralogic, and chemical properties.
   Combined with soil and weather data, such characterization sheds light
   on: (1) the relation between dust storms and synoptic climatic
   conditions; (2) the importance of Owens (dry) Lake (California) as a
   dominant source of southwestern U.S. dust, for as much as 400 km
   downwind; (3) the impacts of human disturbances in the desert, revealed
   by signatures of agricultural and construction dust; and (4) the
   composition and flux of regional background dust composition and flux.
   Past dust flux is studied from late Quaternary eolian deposits, partly
   using a new combination of magnetic and chemical methods developed to
   recognize eolian dust in soils and surficial deposits over large
   regions. Such studies have applications to understanding current plant
   distribution, substrates for biologic soil crust, and paleoenvironmental
   histories of ecosystems.
   A wind-erosion model based on wind strength, atmospheric shear stress on
   the surface, and atmospheric stability is being developed. This model
   will be constrained by remote sensing and ground-based observations and
   will then be linked with a regional climate model and interactive
   vegetation package to forecast how various climatic and land-use
   scenarios interact with critical wind speeds required to move surface
   materials. We will attempt to answer the following questions: How does
   wind strength vary with natural climate cycles on decadal and century
   time scales? To what extent will winds become stronger or weaker under
   future climate scenarios? How have soil moisture and vegetation changes
   affected wind erosion in the past, and what can we expect in the future?
   As an example of possible future conditions, projections of doubled
   atmospheric CO2 (above pre-industrial levels) for the southwestern U.S.
   suggest a decrease in winter soil moisture, which may enhance wind
   erosion.}},

   difficulty - how to find a common language and a common theme for

   narrative approach and its application for this purpose. There were
   three groups investigated in terms of individual stories (life-stories)
   connected with the future of rural landscape. Rural group, urban group
   and expert group have a common theme in their stories: high appreciation

Abstract = {{Changes of vertical arrangements in plant communities cause changes in
   processes and habitat parameters such as microclimate, nutrient cycles,
   arthropod behaviour and others. Therefore the description and analysis
   of structural dynamics is the basis for investigations at the level of
   processes. With VESTA (VErtical vegetation STructure Analysis), an
   improved photographic method of analysing vertical vegetation structure
   was designed to study various spatial parameters, especially in pioneer
   and grassland ecosystems. Following standardised data sampling in the
   field based on digital photography, the spatiotemporal characteristics
   of the vertical vegetation structure can be extracted by a newly
   elaborated software (SIDELOOK). The new method is introduced, and
   parameters of analysis such as ``denseness{''} and ``roughness{''} are
   defined. Evaluation of the method gives these main results:
   multiple structural characteristics of vertical vegetation structure can
   be obtained on the basis of digital images,
   the method is quick and easy to apply in nearly all weather situations,
   the data output is robust against differences between persons using the
   method,
   the effects of optical distortions are slight, and height and other
   parameters are robust in a comparison to field data,
   a good correlation with above-ground phytomass coverage was found, and
   the data output can easily be used for subsequent data analysis, e.g. by
   ordination techniques.
   In order to demonstrate the possibilities of VESTA with reference to
   some examples, the following studies are introduced:
   Structural data for six plant communities were discriminated by a PCA,
   showing the gradients of succession on sandy soils.
   Spatio-temporal changes such as phenological rhythmicity are depicted.
   The grazing impact is characterized as an example of disturbance
   processes: Here the upgrowth continues on the ungrazed plots whereas
   height parameters decrease and the spatial heterogeneity increases under
   sheep grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Long term environmental records for take and river ecosystems provide a
   valuable generic tool for water quality management. These data sets can
   play a pivotal role in determining natural baseline conditions,
   detecting early evidence of change, identifying the causal mechanisms of
   water quality deterioration, and in gauging the success of remediation
   measures. At most sites, however, such data are sparse or completely
   lacking. New advances in paleolimnology, that is the study of past
   environments based on the analysis of sediments, offer considerable
   potential for reconstructing these historical records. This
   paleolimnological approach is illustrated by way of water quality
   research on three ecosystems in Quebec, Canada. Lake St-Augustin is a
   small lake characterized by episodes of bottom-water anoxia and summer
   blooms of cyanobacteria that result in its municipal closure to swimming
   and other lake activities for several weeks each summer. A
   paleolimnological analysis based on fossil diatoms showed that there
   have been four phases of nutrient enrichment over the last 240 years
   coinciding with initial colonisation and land development (1760-1900),
   farm development (1900-1950), increased fertiliser use and
   intensification of agriculture (1950-1980), and major road and
   residential expansion (1980-present). The paleolimnological application
   of diatom-based transfer functions for total phosphorus analysis of Lake
   St-Charles; the principal drinking water supply for Quebec City, showed
   that substantial changes took place in the lake coincident with the
   raising of water level in the 1930s. There was no evidence of increasing
   eutrophication since that time, contrary to public perception. Finally,
   geochemical analysis of sediments in the St-Lawrence River showed
   greatly reduced concentrations of heavy metals and other pollutants over
   the period 1960-90, but the paleolimnological record also underscores
   the need for ongoing improvements in pollution control measures.}},

Pages = {{29-44}},
Abstract = {{We have developed a generalized dynamic, numerical model to study
   Pfiesteria population dynamics based on available observations and
   literature. We have incorporated formulations into this model which
   allow us to track changes in cell size in relation to food availability
   and other environmental conditions, which can be used for modeling a
   variety of cell-size dependent physiological functions. With this model,
   we are able to follow the time dependency of both individual size and
   abundance of Pfiesteria zoospores in cultures. We also have developed a
   general, starvation-based trigger mechanism for cyst formation for
   mixotrophic species like Pfiesteria, which is based on the size of
   zoospores determined by previous food conditions and the decrease or
   increase in size determined by the current food conditions. The model
   results suggest that zoospore concentration can be regulated effectively
   by both bottom-up control by food availability and the top-down control
   by zooplankton grazing. Model sensitivity analysis shows that the
   results are fairly robust with respect to changes in the model parameter
   values. This paper represents a significant step forward in our efforts
   to model complicated life-cycle phenomena in dinoflagellates like
   Pfiesteria and, in so doing, also provides some important new approaches

Abstract = {{Atmosphere-ocean chemical exchanges exert a significant control on both
   the gas-phase and particulate composition of the atmosphere. As a
   consequence, there are close linkages of these exchanges with
   atmospheric radiative transfer, climate and atmospheric chemistry. Such
   exchanges are important to human society both because they are
   fundamental to predictions of future climate forcing and because of an
   immediate need for science-based assessment of the effectiveness of
   proposed emission controls and other mitigation strategies. In this
   article we present a subjective overview of the current state of
   knowledge related to the exchange of climate-relevant materials
   including long-lived gases (CO2, N2O), short lived gases including
   volatile sulphur and halogen-containing compounds, and sea salt. Because
   of the importance of quantification of air-sea exchanges for short-term
   control of the concentration of these species in ocean and atmosphere,
   we also review recent progress and present opportunities related to
   studies of air-sea gas transfer. Finally we present a range of open
   questions, promising approaches and major challenges related to the
   measurement, modelling and understanding of air-sea chemical exchanges.
   Many of these issues will be addressed within the new global change
   research program SOLAS (Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study).}},

Abstract = {{Many of the most challenging questions in ecosystem science today are
   posed at intersections between disciplines, scales, and paradigms.
   Addressing such questions requires synthesis and integration, to which
   quantitative models can make important contributions. ``Synthesis{''} is
   derived from the Greek syntithenai, meaning ``to put together{''};
   integration is the process through which synthesis is achieved.
   Synthetic or integrative quantitative models are developed to enhance
   understanding of the system, which can be fostered by formulating
   appropriate questions. Four ways in which quantitative models contribute
   to integration and synthesis are: (1) facilitating creative and critical
   thinking about relationships in a system, (2) comparing alternative ways
   of conceptualizing a system, (3) identifying principles or relationships
   that are general across systems, and (4) initiating an iterative process
   in which models and empirical observation constantly inform one another
   by developing models at the beginning of a research project. A new
   simple model integrating land use, natural disturbance, and the dynamics
   of riparian coarse woody debris (CWD) in northern Wisconsin (USA) was
   developed as an example. The model simulated relationships among three
   state variables: the density of live trees in the riparian forest, the
   density of standing snags, and the density of CWD. Four scenarios were
   simulated: (1) nominal, (2) single timber harvest, (3) large infrequent
   wind disturbance, and (4) lakeshore development. Results suggested that
   riparian CWD could be enhanced and maintained by large infrequent
   disturbances. Shoreline development always reduced riparian CWD, but the
   relationship was nonlinear. Shoreline development also had a more
   persistent negative impact on riparian CWD than did a single large
   clearcut. The model illustrated the approaches to question formulation;
   the combination of data and perspectives usually considered separately;
   and the use of synthetic modeling at the beginning of a research
   project. Synthesis and integration are critical to scientific progress
   and to finding solutions to many environmental problems facing society.
   Ecologists should continue to combine quantitative models with
   observations and experiments in their search for general understanding
   of ecological systems.}},

Abstract = {{The processes of science and decision making share an important
   characteristic: success in each depends upon researchers or decision
   makers having some ability to anticipate the consequences of their
   actions. The predictive capacity of science holds great appeal for
   decision makers who are grappling with complex and controversial
   environmental issues by promising to enhance their ability to determine
   a need for and outcomes of alternative decisions. As a result, the very
   process of science can be portrayed as a positive step toward solving a
   policy problem. The convergence-and perhaps confusion-of prediction in
   science and prediction for policy presents a suite of hidden dangers for
   the conduct of science and the challenge of effective decision making.
   This chapter, organized as a set of inter-related analytical vignettes,
   seeks to expose some of these hidden dangers and to recommend strategies
   to overcome them in the process of environmental decision making. In
   particular, this chapter will try to distill some of the lessons gleaned
   from research on modeling, prediction, and decision making in the earth
   and atmospheric sciences for quantitative modeling of ecosystems. One
   clear implication is that conventional approaches to modeling and
   prediction cannot simultaneously meet the needs of both science and
   decision making. For ecosystem science, there fortunately exists a body
   of experience in. understanding, using, and producing predictions across
   the sciences on which to develop new understandings of the relationship
   of science and decision making to the potential benefit of both research
   and policy.}},

Abstract = {{Human ability to adapt to climate variability may help alleviate the
   effects of predicted longer-term climate variability on our social,
   ecological and economic systems. It is not possible to model human
   adaptation to climate variability without considering a bewildering
   array of variables. The stochastic, reflexive, threshold-sensitive,
   time-dependent and system-wide nature of the variables usually
   associated with human coping and learning responses to climate
   variability implies the existence of a resilient-centred, complex
   system. The reflexive character of a resilient system especially
   complicates modelling approaches based on traditional deterministic and
   stochastic modelling paradigms. We are interested in the use of
   participatory game simulation models that overcome the probabilistic
   element of human decision-making by including it as a key variable. Our
   approach is based on a 2 stage-modelling project that combines the
   benefits of a whole-system approach with participatory modelling. In
   this paper we explore the role of an influence matrix in scoping,
   reducing and formulating the structure of a future game simulation

Abstract = {{Understanding the major controls on water flow and solute transport at
   the hillslope scale remains a major topic of research despite numerous
   hillslope experiments at different sites around the world. For example,
   the influence of lateral preferential flow due to pipes or macropores in
   the subsurface flow is still unresolved. Experiments show the often
   paradoxical finding of fast entry of event water and fast mobilization
   of applied tracers with a concomitant displacement of largely ``old{''}
   water from the slope base into the stream or riparian zone. Detailed
   investigations of the actual structures in the soil that promote and
   conduct lateral water transfer often show relatively short length
   scales. Thus, many key questions exist, including: How do the
   preferential flow systems connect across the hillslope during rainfall
   events? How does this preferential connection affect the mixing of new
   and old water? We use a new virtual experiment approach to identify the
   controls of water flow and solute transport at the hillslope scale for
   two well studied hillslopes in New Zealand and Japan. Previous detailed
   information on soil pipe and soil matrix properties at these sites
   provides the necessary dialog for our virtual experiments. Virtual
   experiments combine the knowledge of experimentalist and modeler to
   study the influence of pipe density, geometry and pipe length on water
   flow, nutrient transport, and event and pre-event water contribution.
   The approach is able to show how different areas within the hillslope
   connect and disconnect and how these episodic connections might control
   threshold behavior observed at these and other experimental hillslope
   sites around the world.}},

Abstract = {{Communities in Australia's tropical savannas depend upon the region's
   natural resources for income and employment. Historically, this
   dependence has focused on `productive' industries: mining, grazing and,
   in the case of coastal communities, fishing. More recently, the
   importance of tourism to communities has increased with growing numbers
   of domestic and international visitors to savanna destinations. Tourism
   can offer new development options and provide an avenue for decreasing
   welfare dependency in remote populations. Yet tourism does not
   necessarily benefit all, and in some cases it may even decrease net
   welfare of remote host communities. It is, therefore, important to
   manage tourism so as to ensure that it makes a long-term contribution to
   the ecologically sustainable development of savanna regions. To do that,
   one needs to understand the impact which tourism has upon communities.
   This paper presents a model of tourism impact in the Carpentaria shire
   of North West Queensland, Australia. Data from an in-progress empirical
   research project are analysed in the context of the model and a
   methodology for making qualitative predictions about the likely impact
   of changes to the visitor mix on sectors of the regional economy and on
   recreational fishing effort is developed. To the extent that policy
   influences the visitor mix, such a method provides a way of considering
   some of the ramifications of policy on the regional community in an
   important step towards developing plans which improve the community
   benefits of tourism.}},

Abstract = {{Soil attributes, including those in mine spoil heaps, critically affect
   plant growth during land rehabilitation. Their characterization through
   a limited number of samples requires quantification of spatial
   variability, which is then used at various stages throughout the
   rehabilitation process and assists risk analysis and rehabilitation
   decision making. Stochastic simulation is a tool used for the
   quantification of uncertainty. This paper presents the suitability of
   stochastic simulation for the joint simulation of soil attributes and
   introduces a new computationally efficient method. The method is based
   on: (i) the Minimum/Maximum Autocorrelation Factors (MAF), involving the
   de-correlation of pertinent variables into spatially non-correlated
   factors, and (ii) the simulation of MAF and back transformation to the
   conditional simulations of the correlated variables. MAF factors in
   point (ii) are simulated using the new Generalised Sequential Gaussian
   Simulation (GSGS) technique which is substantially more efficient that
   the traditional sequential simulation methods. The formulated approach
   is applied to mine spoil data, specifically electrical conductivity and
   pH, which typically contribute to restricted plant growth on spoils in
   Queensland coal mines. The results of the simulations are used to
   quantify risk of exceeding significant thresholds for each variable,
   thereby identifying problem rehabilitation areas. The case study
   demonstrates the practical aspects of the method as well as its use in
   planning rehabilitation strategies and predictions of future performance
   of the rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous aquatic species are threatened with extinction from habitat
   elimination Or modification. One particularly imperilled group is the
   freshwater gastropod family Pleuroceridae. Pleurocerids reach their
   greatest diversity in the southeastern United States, and many species
   are currently considered extinct, endangered or threatened. One issue
   hindering efforts to implement conservation management plans for
   imperilled pleurocerid species is that the taxonomy is in an abysmal
   state. The taxonomy of pleurocerids is currently based on late 19th- and
   early 20th-century studies, which used a typological or morphospecies
   concept. Most biologists today doubt the validity of many of the
   currently recognized species; however, this does not stop them from
   assigning conservation ranks in an attempt to determine which species
   are imperilled or currently stable. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis
   of the pleurocerid genus Lithasia using morphological and mitochondrial
   DNA sequence (mtDNA) data in an attempt to delimit species boundaries
   and test previous taxonomic schemes. We found that the current taxonomy
   of Lithasia does not reflect species diversity adequately within the
   genus, with two new undescribed species being discovered. The
   conservation status ranks of the new, undescribed species are imperilled
   and would have been overlooked had we relied on the conventional
   taxonomy. Additionally, the undescribed species' conservation ranks that
   were previously apparently secure became vulnerable due to being
   inappropriately assigned as members of formerly widely distributed
   species instead of the imperilled status they warrant and vice versa, as
   some taxa that were considered imperilled are now thought to be modestly
   stable. Our study suggests that conservation ranks should be considered
   suspect at best in taxonomically poorly known groups until the taxa are
   reviewed using modern systematic methods.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional approaches to fisheries management, which have been
   singular, species-based and nonsectoral, have failed to protect the
   world's fisheries resources. This has resulted in the overexploitation
   of fish stocks, displacement of fishing fleets and dislocation of
   fishing communities. The first attempts at international regulation of
   fisheries were simple, but premised on the notion that the ocean's
   resources were inexhaustible. This belief influenced attitudes towards
   exploitation of the fisheries resources in particular, and conservation
   and management of those resources in general. Improved understanding of
   the oceans and the exhaustibility of fisheries resources has resulted in
   a change both in the approach towards fisheries management and in the
   kind of responses developed by the international community. It is now
   accepted that it is not possible simply to manage a fishery by merely
   controlling the quantity of fish taken out of the water. Account must be
   taken of all factors affecting the resource, including the impact of
   human activities from land-based sources.
   New, more modern, comprehensive and holistic approaches have been
   developed in recent years to address fishery problems. One of these is
   the ecosystem management approach. This chapter examines a number of key
   international instruments that demonstrate the extent to which ecosystem
   management has been applied to conservation of fishery resources. It
   begins by outlining the major obligations of instruments of global
   applications, which include, inter alia, the 1982 United Nations
   Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), and the 1992 Convention on
   Biological Diversity (CBD). The chapter also discusses a number of
   regional and national initiatives towards ecosystem approaches to
   fishery conservation and management, and highlights the problems
   impinging on the effective implementation of these initiatives. It
   concludes by pointing out that the most notable strengths of the
   international instruments studied for this chapter are the instruments
   themselves, as they attempt to establish a global framework for
   conservation and management of marine environments and resources. The
   inclusion of the ecosystem approach is a positive element, as it moves
   away from the traditional species and stock focuses.}},

Abstract = {{The new millennium marks a time when scientific opinion and
   environmentalist sentiment are at last converging on the perception that
   the world's natural marine heritage is facing grave threats. What
   environmentalists have come to call the `marine biodiversity crisis' is
   a pervasive and by now well-documented phenomenon, until recently
   occurring largely unnoticed beneath the deceptively unchanging blanket
   of the ocean's surface. The fact that this problem is essentially an
   invisible one makes it all the more insidious, and our terrestrial bias
   makes combating the problem a huge and difficult task. Human impacts on
   our seas take many forms and result not only from activities that affect
   species directly - such as overfishing, in-filling of wetlands and
   coastal deforestation - but also from activities that affect oceans
   indirectly, such as through land-based sources of pollution, freshwater
   diversion from estuaries, invasive species and climate change.
   Due to the expanding scope of both global coastal degradation and
   fisheries conflicts, environmental groups recently have become more and
   more involved in fisheries management and conflict resolution. In
   tackling fisheries issues, most organizations attempt to base their
   projects and advocacy on the best available scientific information.
   These groups sometimes undertake in-house scientific research,
   predictive modelling and meta-analysis. However, in most cases, the
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are recipients of scientific
   information and liaise between the scientific community, decision makers
   and the public. The key scientific information underpinning campaigns
   and field projects addresses three facets of sustainability: (i) the
   levels of resource removal that can be realized without adverse impact
   on the ecosystem, given the particular environmental condition of the
   ecosystem at time of harvest; (ii) the least invasive means by which
   that harvest can be undertaken at desired levels of harvest, such that
   habitat impacts and by-catch are minimized; and (iii) the most
   appropriate stocks for large-scale harvest, namely protecting stocks
   that are sole representatives of genetically unique organisms and stocks
   whose ecological role is critically important and so not redundant.
   Environmental groups, however, are as diverse in their character,
   approach and constituencies as the environmental problems they address.
   They function variously as purveyors of information, as translators of
   scientific and management language to the vernacular, as honest brokers
   (although their own value systems cause some to question their honesty),
   as advocates and lobbyists for certain types of reform or regulatory
   measures, and as adversaries to management agencies and industry when
   invoking environmental litigation. In many of these roles, environmental
   groups have been seen as the antithesis to development, to business
   interests, and to the needs of many user groups. Yet, today,
   environmental groups play an increasingly important non-adversarial role
   in demonstrating how conservation and sustainable use can be
   accomplished, through practical, applied conservation projects that
   benefit users, community groups, business and national interests. If a
   common environmentalist response to fisheries-induced loss of marine
   biodiversity can be said to exist (and this is a dangerous assumption,
   given the diversity of groups and their approaches), it is to synthesize
   existing information, communicate it, and advocate change in policy and
   regulations where felt necessary. In addition, some groups go beyond
   fisheries-by-fisheries management reform to advocate: (i) shifting the
   burden of proof when evaluating fishing impacts on ecosystems; and (ii)
   establishing strictly protected marine reserves to further our
   understanding of and protect species, habitats and ecological processes.
   Such reserves are implemented in a variety of fashions: as components
   within larger, multiple-use protected areas that seek to accommodate a
   wide array of users; as single elements in scientifically designed
   reserve networks; and as one tool of many used in corridor approaches,
   coastal management and regional planning.
   From the environmentalist's or conservationist's perspective, solutions
   lie not in shutting down fisheries but rather in modifying the way we
   undertake management, and in using public awareness to help raise
   political will to conserve marine systems. Coupling current consumer
   awareness and purchasing power with strong and effective management
   could indeed alleviate pressure on many marine species and allow their
   subsequent recovery. Additionally, environmental groups will need to
   recognize and support real willingness among governmental agencies and
   decision makers to protect areas needed for fish spawning, feeding and
   migration through marine reserves, and help such forward-thinking
   agencies to enter into enforceable international agreements to protect
   shared or commons resources. By highlighting such potential successes,
   and by working to demonstrate how success can be achieved, environmental
   groups can begin to shed their image of extremist adversaries, and help
   decision-making bodies implement effective and beneficial management
   regimes.
   A common thread is now emerging from analysis of cases where fisheries
   management and marine conservation has succeeded - and we can well learn
   from this common thread. The central element in these initiatives is a
   holistic approach - one that considers renewable living resources as
   part of a wider, interconnected ecosystem, one that evaluates all
   aspects of production or development and one that treats humans as bone
   fide elements of living systems. These integrated approaches take into
   account ecosystem interconnections and the true ecological costs of
   fisheries, the entire production chain and its environmental costs, and
   human interconnections, and thus the social costs (and benefits) of
   fisheries development. Holistic solutions are those that recognize these
   connections and try to minimize ecological, environmental and social
   costs, while maximizing the benefits (and benefit sharing) that can
   accrue from engagement in well-managed marine resource use. Given the
   magnitude and complexity of global fisheries issues, only such holistic
   prescriptions will make it possible for nations to achieve responsible
   fisheries in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock overgrazing and stream incision in the western USA often
   result in encroachment and dominance of Artemisia tridentata ssp.
   tridentata (Big sagebrush) in riparian areas that formerly supported
   meadows. To define the alternative states and thresholds for these
   ecosystems, we conducted a restoration experiment that included sites
   with high, intermediate or low water tables. We used a paired-plot
   approach in which one plot on each site was burned and seeded with
   native grasses and forbs typical of naturally occurring dry meadow and
   Artemisia/Leymus cinereus ecological types, while adjacent unburned
   plots served as controls. Sites with high and intermediate water tables
   had greater initial abundances of perennial grasses typical of dry
   meadows, such as Leymus triticoides and Poa secunda ssp. juncifolia, and
   these species increased after the burn. In contrast, sites with low
   water tables were dominated by annual forbs such as Chenopodium album
   and Descurainia pinnata after the burn. Biomass increased progressively
   from 1997 to 1999 on burned plots, while controls showed little change.
   Burning effects were microsite specific, with former Artemisia
   microsites exhibiting lower biomass than interspaces initially, but
   similar or higher biomass by the third year. Establishment of seeded
   species was low and species composition was determined largely by
   pre-burn vegetation. Artemisia dominated sites with high water tables
   appear to represent an alternative state of the dry meadow ecological
   type, while sites with low water table sites have crossed an abiotic
   threshold governed by water tables and represent a new ecological type.
   Burning is an effective tool for restoring relatively high water table
   sites, but low water table sites will require burning and seeding with
   species adapted to more xeric conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The utility of explicit spatial predictions for biodiversity assessment
   is investigated with New Zealand fern flora. Distributions of 43 species
   were modelled from climatic and landform variables and predicted across
   New Zealand using generalised additive models (GAM). An original package
   of functions called generalised regression analysis and spatial
   prediction ( GRASP) was developed to perform the analyses. On average,
   for the 43 models, the contributions of environmental variables indicate
   that mean annual temperature is the most important factor at this broad
   regional scale. Both annual solar radiation and its seasonality had
   higher correlations than temperature seasonality. Measures of water
   availability such as ratio of rainfall to potential evapotranspiration,
   air saturation deficit and soil water deficit presented significant
   contributions. Lithology was a better predictor than slope and drainage.
   These results are similar to those obtained from analyses of the
   distributions of New Zealand tree species and are consistent with the
   hypothesis that both tree and fern diversity are highest on sites
   conducive to high productivity. In order to identify hotspots of fern
   diversity, spatial predictions of individual species were summed up. The
   resulting map gave a very similar result to the direct prediction of
   their corresponding richness ( number of species by plot out of 43
   spp.). As a consequence, and where individual species models were not
   all available, the number of species within different species
   assemblages was directly modelled. Predicted richness hotspots of total
   species ( out of 122 spp.), selected species ( out of 43 and 21 spp.)
   and common species ( out of 23 spp.) present very similar spatial
   patterns and are highly correlated. Richness of uncommon species ( out
   of 39 spp.) was also accurately predicted, but presented a different
   spatial pattern. The number of rare species ( out of 60 spp.) was not
   correctly modelled. Even though the lack of data for rare species
   clearly limits the application of this approach, fern community
   composition of more common species can be partially reconstructed from
   individual species predictions. This case study offers therefore a
   consistent approach not only for biodiversity hotspots identification,
   but also for setting targets to biodiversity assessment and restoration
   programs.}},

Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The subdesert mesite, a terrestrial non-passerine bird endemic to the
   Mikea Forest of southwest Madagascar, is currently classified as
   globally threatened (category: Vulnerable). However, accurate assessment
   of threat in accordance with the IUCN Red List criteria (A, B and C)
   requires data on effective population size, area of habitat occupied and
   rate of decline, none of which is available for this species. Here we
   present the first empirical estimates of its population size using five
   complementary methods, three incorporating data on territory size and
   two using data gathered during call-playback surveys conducted
   throughout its entire global range. Estimates vary from 98,000 to
   152,000 individuals, with the most reliable possibly being that
   generated by distance sampling (115,000). This figure is more than an
   order of magnitude greater than the only published estimate of <10,000
   individuals. By analysing data on forest cover change, we estimate the
   population of the subdesert mesite to have declined by, at most, 10\% in
   three generations. Although the rate of deforestation in 1994-1999 is
   double that calculated for 1962-1994, it is deemed unlikely that the
   population will decline by 20\% over the next three generations. As such
   the species fails to meet criterion A. Although the subdesert inesite's
   range and area of occupancy are small, they are not fragmented and do
   not comprise fewer than 10 locations. Consequently, this species does
   not meet criterion B. Further, the species fails to meet criterion C,
   for which a maximum of 10,000 mature adults is required. According to
   IUCN (2000 Red List of Threatened Species) this species should therefore
   be downlisted in status. We discuss why it still warrants conservation
   attention and suggest the need for modifications to the criteria
   thresholds in relation to basic information about the ecology and
   taxonomic distinctness of species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Canopy structural data can be used for biomass estimation and studies of
   carbon cycling, disturbance, energy balance, and hydrological processes
   in tropical forest ecosystems. Scarce information on canopy dimensions
   reflects the difficulties associated with measuring crown height, width,
   depth, and area in tall, humid tropical forests. New field and
   spaceborne observations provide an opportunity to acquire these
   measurements, but the accuracy and reliability of the methods are
   unknown. We used a handheld laser range finder to estimate tree crown
   height, diameter, and depth in a lowland tropical forest in the eastern
   Amazon, Brazil, for a sampling of 300 trees stratified by diameter at
   breast height (DBH). We found significant relationships between DBH and
   both tree height and crown diameter derived from the laser measurements.
   We also quantified changes in crown shape between tree height classes,
   finding a significant but weak positive trend between crown depth and
   width. We then compared the field-based measurements of crown diameter
   and area to estimates derived manually from panchromatic 0.8 m spatial
   resolution IKONOS satellite imagery. Median crown diameter derived from
   satellite observations was 78 percent greater than that derived from
   field-based laser measurements. The statistical distribution of crown
   diameters from IKONOS was biased toward larger trees, probably due to
   merging of smaller tree crowns, underestimation of understory trees, and
   overestimation of individual crown dimensions. The median crown area
   derived front IKONOS was 65 percent higher than the value modeled from
   field-based measurements. We conclude that manual interpretation of
   IKONOS satellite data did not accurately estimate distributions of tree
   crown dimensions in a tall tropical forest of eastern Amazonia. Other
   methods will be needed to more accurately estimate crown dimensions from
   high spatial resolution satellite imagery.}},

Abstract = {{Although principal coordinates analysis is one of the most widely used
   ordination methods in ecology, no study had been undertaken as yet on
   the combined effect of gradient type and resemblance coefficient on the
   results. We examine the performance of principal coordinates analysis
   with different choices of the resemblance function and different types
   of a single, underlying gradient. Whereas unimodal species response to
   long gradients always leads to horseshoe (or arch)-shaped configurations
   in the first two dimensions, the converse is not true; curvilinear
   arrangements cannot generally be explained by the Gaussian model.
   Several resemblance coefficients widely used in ecology produce
   paradoxical arches from perfectly linear data. Species richness changes
   alone, may also lead to a horseshoe for even more distance functions,
   with the noted exception of Manhattan metric. The appearance of arches
   is a mathematical necessity in these cases; true artifacts are
   introduced only if distances are treated inappropriately before
   eigenanalysis. Examples illustrate that similar configurations (curves
   and even circles) may arise from very different data structures;
   therefore the shape of the point scatter is insufficient by itself to
   identify background ecological phenomena. The horseshoe effect may be
   diminished and eigenvalue extraction may be made more efficient if input
   measures are raised to high powers; but this operation is recommended
   only in combination with standard analyses, as part of a comparative
   approach. We derive a new distance function, implying standardization by
   species totals, from the chi-square distance. We found that this
   function improves gradient recovery when there is unimodal species
   response and. some species have their optima outside the range of study.}},

Abstract = {{We have constructed a phenological model of leaf area index (LAI) of
   forests based on biological principles of leaf growth. Field data of
   maximum LAI from 794 plots with mature or nearly mature stand ages over
   China were used to parameterize and calibrate the model. New
   measurements of maximum LAI from 16 natural forest sites were used to
   validate the simulated maximum LAI. The predictions of seasonal LAI
   patterns were compared with seasonal changes derived from the 1-km
   satellite AVHRR-NDVI data for nine undisturbed forest sites in eastern
   China. Then, we used the model to map maximum LAI values for forests in
   China. Model results indicated that the PhenLAI model generally
   predicted maximum LAI well for most forest types, even when maximum LAI
   is > 6. This suggests an ecological approach to the saturation problem
   in satellite detection of high forest LAI where the relationship between
   NDVI and LAI reaches an asymptote near a projected LAI value of 5 or 6.
   Furthermore, the predictions of seasonal LAI patterns in timing and
   dynamics were generally consistent with the satellite NDVI changes,
   except for monsoon forest and rain forest in south China where satellite
   detection of seasonal variation in leaf area is hardly possible.
   Compared with average projected LAI measurements of global forests from
   809 field plots in literature data, our maximum LAI values were close to
   the global literature data for most of Chinese forests, but the average
   area-weighted maximum LAI for all forests of China (6.68 +/- 3.85) was
   higher than the global mean LAI of the 809 field plots (5.55 +/- 4.14).
   We believe that forest LAI in China is commonly > 6, especially in
   tropical rainforest, subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest,
   temperate mixed forest, and boreal/alpine spruce-fir forest where
   satellite detection of high LAI is hardly possible.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the status of coarse woody debris (CWD, fallen wood) on
   floodplains of the southern Murray-Darling basin of southeastern
   Australia. The floodplains are dominated floristically by the river red
   gum Eucalyptus camaldulensis. Aerial survey techniques were used to
   estimate the amounts of woody debris within 200 m of the channels along
   2,442 km of 11 rivers of the system, including the Murray and Darling
   Rivers and the Darling Anabranch. Aerially based indices were converted
   into wood volumes by using ground-truthing at a selection of sites;
   there was a strong correlation between index values and measured wood
   volume densities. For thickly forested sites such as Barmah, Gunbower
   Island, and the Ovens floodplains, the aerial method was not useful, so
   ground measurements at randomly positioned sites within the forests were
   used. Volumes were translated into mass by using conversion factors
   drawn from the literature. We estimated that total tonnage on
   approximately 221,000 ha of floodplain forests was 4.175+/-0.579x10(6)
   tonne. In the larger forested blocks (>7,000 ha), mean wood densities
   ranged between approximately 12 tonne/ha on the lower Goulburn up to
   approximately 24 tonne/ha at Barmah State Forest. The area-weighted mean
   for the entire area was approximately 19 tonne/ha. A main purpose of the
   research was to place these figures into an historical perspective to
   evaluate implications for restoration. A thorough search of historical
   documentation revealed that there are no extant data upon which to
   estimate pre-European settlement levels. We used information from an
   apparently undisturbed ``unmanaged{''} site in the Millewa forests of
   southern New South Wales as a basis. Wood density there corresponded to
   a mean figure of 125 tonne/ha wood-mass density. By using this figure we
   estimate that CWD levels on the southern Murray-Darling basin may be of
   the order of 15\% of pre-European settlement levels. Full restoration of
   the 221,000 ha surveyed would require 23.5+/-0.579x10(6) tonne, which is
   equivalent to about 600,000 mature (1 m diameter at breast height) river
   red gum trees or the amount of timber derived from clear felling about
   115,000 ha of river red gum forest at current stocking levels. We
   discuss the implications of this massive deficit and possible short- and
   long-term solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Preexisting receiver biases have been shown to affect how females detect
   and respond to new conspecific traits in a mate Choice context. Although
   preexisting biases have often been discussed in the context of female
   mate choice, these biases need not be sex limited. In the genus
   Xiphaphorus, swordtail males possess a sexually selected trait, the
   word. Here I consider evidence that the state of a bias favoring sworded
   conspecifics may be generally shared by the sexes in taxa in which the
   sword has not arisen. In three unsworded species of poeciliid fishes,
   both males and females prefer members of the other sex with swords, lit
   a fourth species, males and females share the absence of a response to a
   sword. This congruity between the sexes suggests that response biases
   may not be sex limited and that the sexes could historically share
   common mechanisms producing shared mating responses. Alternatively,
   selection may tend to result in parallel changes in biases in the sexes.
   This work expands our understanding of receiver biases by using a
   phylogenetic approach to examine Whether biases are historically shared

Abstract = {{Humans have used Caribbean island landscapes for millennia. The
   conversion of wild lands to built-up lands or to agricultural lands in
   these tropical countries follows predictable patterns. Conversion of
   moist forest life zones and fertile flatlands is faster than conversion
   of wet and rain forest life zones and low fertility steep lands. In
   Puerto Rico, these trends are leading to increased built-up areas,
   environmental surprises, and increased dependence on external subsidies.
   Changes over the past 50 yr also include a reversal in deforestation and
   increase in forest patch size in spite of increasing human population
   density. Present forests have different species composition than the
   original ones but are indistinguishable in physiognomy and basic
   function. The reversal of deforestation and forest fragmentation trends,
   if accompanied by an understanding of the forces that cause the
   reversal, can result in the development of tools for landscape
   management. Tropical landscape management requires understanding and

Abstract = {{Thalassiosira spp., large-chain forming centric diatoms, typically
   dominate the biomass during phytoplankton blooms in the North Water
   Polynya (76 to 79degreesN, centred on ca. longitude 75degreesW), which
   is the largest recurring polynya in the Canadian Arctic. We used an
   experimental method based on semi-continuous cultures to investigate
   mechanisms responsible for bloom maintenance and associated changes in
   microbial food web constituents. We compared 2 treatments: (1) a new
   nutrient system in which the cultures were partially enriched every 2 d
   with nutrient-rich seawater from depth to simulate horizontal or
   vertical advection, and (2) a recycled nutrient system in which large
   particles (>2.0 mum) were partially removed every 2 d to simulate
   grazing and sinking losses without nutrient replacement. The experiment
   lasted 8 d. In the new nutrient treatment, large diatoms, particularly
   Thalassiosira spp. and to a lesser extent Chaetoceros spp., consumed the
   added nutrients and continued to dominate production and biomass of the
   protist community. The total eukaryotic community production in the
   `recycled' community shifted to one dominated by dinoflagellates and
   ciliates in the absence of diatom growth. These 2 end points
   corresponded to 2 types of communities observed in the North Water
   Polynya in June 1998. Net production rates for viruses and bacteria were
   not significantly different between treatments. These results
   demonstrate the importance of advective processes in maintaining a
   prolonged diatom bloom. An underlying microbial food web dominated by
   large (>20 mum) ciliates and dinoflagellates was able to maintain
   similar rates of net production respective of new versus recycled
   nutrient supply. Dominance of the protist communities by large cells
   under both conditions is likely to favour the sustained high
   productivity of zooplankton and megafauna that characterize the North
   Water Polynya.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to promote a broad and flexible perspective
   on ecological restoration of Southwestern (U.S.) ponderosa pine forests.
   Ponderosa pine forests in the region have been radically altered by
   Euro-American land uses, including livestock grazing, fire suppression,
   and logging. Dense thickets of young trees now abound, old-growth and
   biodiversity have declined, and human and ecological communities are
   increasingly vulnerable to destructive crown fires. A consensus has
   emerged that it is urgent to restore more natural conditions to these
   forests. Efforts to restore Southwestern forests will require extensive
   projects employing varying combinations of young-tree thinning and
   reintroduction of low-intensity fires. Treatments must be flexible
   enough to recognize and accommodate: high levels of natural
   heterogeneity; dynamic ecosystems; wildlife and other biodiversity
   considerations; scientific uncertainty; and the challenges of
   on-the-ground implementation. Ecological restoration should reset
   ecosystem trends toward an envelope of ``natural variability,{''}
   including the reestablishment of natural processes. Reconstructed
   historic reference conditions are best used as general guides rather
   than rigid restoration prescriptions. In the long term, the best way to
   align forest conditions to track ongoing climate changes is to restore
   fire, which naturally correlates with current climate. Some stands need
   substantial structural manipulation (thinning) before fire can safely be
   reintroduced. In other areas, such as large wilderness and roadless
   areas, fire alone may suffice as the main tool of ecological
   restoration, recreating the natural interaction of structure and
   process. Impatience, overreaction to crown fire risks, extractive
   economics, or hubris could lead to widespread application of highly
   intrusive treatments that may further damage forest ecosystems.
   Investments in research and monitoring of restoration treatments are
   essential to refine restoration methods. We support the development and
   implementation of a diverse range of scientifically viable restoration
   approaches in these forests, suggest principles for ecologically sound
   restoration that immediately reduce crown fire risk and incrementally
   return natural variability and resilience to Southwestern forests, and
   present ecological perspectives on several forest restoration
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Aim We use a retrospective approach to reconstruct the past distribution
   of fire in New England and to investigate the important drivers of this
   pattern across the period of European arrival to North America.
   Location Our study sites are in New England, and range from pitch pine
   and oak forests of coastal Massachusetts, pine and hardwood forests of
   central Massachusetts, and northern hardwood and spruce fir forests of
   northern Massachusetts and Vermont.
   Methods We collected sediment profiles from eighteen lakes across the
   study area to assess fossil charcoal and pollen abundance over the past
   1000 years, including the time period of European arrival and
   settlement.
   Results Based on presettlement pollen composition, our study sites are
   divided into three vegetation types: (1) pitch pine and oak, (2) oak,
   pine and hardwood and (3) northern hardwoods. The abundance of
   presettlement charcoal in these lakes is closely related to climate and
   the composition of surrounding vegetation. Charcoal is most abundant in
   pitch pine forests and least common in northern hardwood forests.
   Following the arrival of Europeans, charcoal abundance increased at most
   sites substantially, and vegetation composition changed in a direction
   of either greater dominance by pitch pine or white pine, depending on
   whether the forests were located in the southern or northern part of New
   England.
   Main conclusions The major factor influencing the distribution of fire
   across New England is climate, which has a direct effect on the physical
   conditions conducive to fire ignition and spread and an indirect effect
   on fire through its control on the distribution of vegetation at this
   spatial scale. We find evidence that other factors exert some control
   over local fire regimes as well including landforms and their impact on
   vegetation composition, firebreaks and prevailing winds. Native
   Americans likely influenced the local occurrence of fire, but their
   impact on regional fire regimes in New England is not apparent from this
   or other studies. However, additional palaeoecological, archaeological
   and historical work needs to be carried out to better address this
   question. In contrast, Europeans had a dramatic effect on fire
   throughout the New England landscape, increasing its occurrence almost
   everywhere.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The aim of this study was to document changes in forest composition,
   structure and distribution across Massachusetts, USA, from the time of
   European settlement (seventeenth century) to the present, and to
   investigate environmental and historical influences on regional patterns
   of variation.
   Location The study area encompasses the State of Massachusetts
   (69.9-73.5degreesE, 41.3-42.9degreesN), a 21,000-km(2) area in the
   north-eastern United States.
   Methods A wide range of historical sources was used to document changes
   in land use and land cover for the historical period. Witness trees from
   early land surveys enabled us to evaluate vegetation patterns prior to
   widespread European settlement, and to compare historical and modern
   species composition. Nineteenth century maps of forest cover and
   contemporary agricultural censuses documented forest patterns during the
   peak agricultural period. Geographic Information System analyses were
   used to relate variation in climate, geology and land-use history to
   historical and modern forest composition.
   Results Massachusetts has a complex east-to-west environmental gradient
   involving changes in physiography, climate, geology and natural
   disturbance. Until the middle of the twentieth century, agriculture was
   the most important land-use across the region; although the percentage
   of land in agriculture and the timing of major land-use changes were
   remarkably consistent across the state, historical forest patch sizes
   varied locally and regionally in relation to physiography. Forest
   composition of both early historical and modern forests is most strongly
   related to environmental conditions, especially variation in climate.
   Historical land-use resulted in a state-wide increase in early
   successional tree species and a dramatic, although recovering, change in
   forest structure.
   Main conclusions At a regional scale, environmental conditions
   apparently control broad patterns of variation in vegetation
   composition. Historical land-use practices were relatively homogenous
   across Massachusetts and local variation was reduced through data
   averaging at broad spatial scales. At finer spatial scales, historical
   land-use has strong and persistent impacts on vegetation composition and

Abstract = {{Aim Over the past four centuries the eastern US has undergone remarkable
   landscape and land-use transformations involving deforestation,
   intensive agriculture, farm abandonment, reforestation and human
   population increase that have induced sweeping changes in wildlife
   assemblages, abundances, and distributions. This study compiles data on
   major wildlife species and seeks to identify broad population trends and
   to address both fundamental and applied questions regarding these
   long-term patterns.
   Location The study encompasses the state of Massachusetts, which is
   broadly representative of the habitat conditions and landscape and
   cultural history of other New England states.
   Methods A wide range of historical sources of data were used including
   town histories, newspaper and other popular accounts, scientific
   studies, museum collections, compiled trapping, bounty and harvest
   records, explorer accounts, and agency records. Statewide distribution
   maps and generalized population trends were assembled for individual
   species where practical, and major trends in species trajectories were
   identified. Emphasis was placed on mammals and birds for which data are
   readily available.
   Results Although species exhibited highly individualistic long-term
   dynamics in response to habitat change and human pressure, six major
   trajectories of species changes are identified: (1) large mammals and
   birds that declined historically and increased recently, (2) open-land
   species that went from low to high abundance with the creation of open
   habitat but are in rapid decline today in the heavily wooded landscape,
   (3) species regionally extirpated or globally extinct, (4) species
   expanding their range from the west, north and south, (5) non-native,
   introduced species, and (6) persistent species not exhibiting major
   long-term trends. Currently, wildlife populations are changing at a
   remarkable rate leading to significant ecological impacts on the
   landscape and many other species, creating major conservation and
   management challenges, and generating novel and oftentimes significant
   conflicts with human values.
   Conclusions The rate of historical and current changes in wildlife
   assemblages pose many scientific and conservation challenges, especially
   in this heavily forested but highly populated landscape. Historical data
   are fragmentary and oftentimes uncertain, modern information on wildlife
   populations is similarly incomplete, and small populations of species
   that are immigrating, expanding or declining from previously high levels
   pose major sampling problems; development of conservation and management
   plans for rapidly expanding populations of large woodland mammals (e.g.
   moose, coyote, deer, bears, beaver) and for declining populations of
   cherished species that are dependent on cultural landscapes generates
   conflicting directives; and educating, and modifying the behaviour of a
   human population that is living in but separated from nature is a
   difficult enterprise. The future is guaranteed to bring major dynamics
   in these historically novel species assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Despite decades of study we have limited insights into the nature of
   the pre-European landscape of the north-eastern USA and the forces and
   changes that shaped modern forest patterns. Information on such
   long-term forest dynamics would provide critical insights into the
   relationships among environmental change, land-use history and biotic
   responses and is greatly needed for conservation planning. To address
   these issues we used modern, historical, and palaeoecological approaches
   to reconstruct the 3500-year history of a New England upland region
   dominated by oak and (formerly) chestnut forests and to interpret the
   interactions among climate change, natural and human disturbance, and
   site factors in controlling vegetation patterns and dynamics at
   different spatial scales.
   Location The study focused on a broad upland ridge dominated by oak
   forests in the north-central Massachusetts town of New Salem. Detailed
   palaeoecological analyses were undertaken of wetland (Chamberlain Swamp)
   and lake (Lily Pond) basins in order to reconstruct local to regional
   scale vegetation dynamics, which were interpreted within the context of
   regional vegetation data from central Massachusetts.
   Methods Palaeoecological methods were used to reconstruct the
   vegetation, fire and land-use history of the local and subregional
   vegetation from the two basins and to place these in the context of
   regional information on vegetation and climate change based on other
   published data. Historical information including maps, archaeological
   and census data, and vegetation information were gathered for the
   landscape and areas surrounding the coring sites. Vegetation sampling in
   transects adjacent to the swamp coring area included tree cores for
   dendrochronological reconstructions.
   Results Stand, landscape and regional forest dynamics were most strongly
   driven by climate, notably an apparent cooling and increase in moisture
   availability c. 1500 yr BP, and European land-use activities commencing
   260 yr BP. However, the abundance of oak and chestnut (fire-tolerant,
   sprouting species) and the distribution of hemlock (fire-intolerant) at
   a stand to landscape scale were also influenced by fire, which, in turn,
   varied with climate and human activity. Despite, or perhaps as a
   consequence of ongoing disturbance by fire and presumably windstorms in
   this hurricane-prone region, the pre-European period was marked by two
   1000+ year periods of remarkably stable forest composition, separated by
   an abrupt compositional shift. In contrast, over the past 260 years the
   vegetation has changed rather continuously in response to human
   activity, producing stand, landscape and regional patterns that are
   novel as well as recent in origin.
   The results indicate that chestnut was a major component of some
   pre-European landscapes in New England, in part because of occasional
   fire, and that cultural and physical factors have interacted over
   millennia to control vegetation patterns and dynamics. Our analyses also
   suggest that the composition of low diversity forests can be remarkably
   stable over millennia. The range of ecological, cultural and management
   insights afforded by this study underscores the fundamental utility of
   very long-term research in science and policy development.}},

   consequences of HWA-induced damage in the form of salvage and

   forests.
   Location The study was conducted within an area extending from southern
   Connecticut up to and including the Connecticut River lowlands west to
   the Berkshire Plateau in central Massaschusetts, USA.
   Methods Overstorey and understorey vegetation and ecosystem function
   parameters such as decomposition and nitrogen cycling were examined in
   logged and unlogged portions of ten hemlock stands varying in HWA damage
   intensity.
   Results Intensive hemlock logging generated more rapid and pronounced
   microenvironment and vegetation changes than chronic HWA damage. Black
   birch (Betula lenta L.) seedling densities and percent cover of brambles
   (Rubus L. spp.), sedges (Carex L. spp.) and hay-scented fern
   (Dennstaedtia punctilobula Michx.) were significantly higher in recent
   harvests vs. HWA-damaged and undamaged sites. High black birch sapling
   densities (> 7000 ha(-1)) were common in the older harvests but not in
   adjacent, HWA-damaged portions of these sites. Undamaged sites had 20\%
   more forest floor mass than HWA-damaged sites and double the mass of
   older cuts. Mass loss rates of cellulose paper suggest that conditions
   were more favourable for decomposition in the damaged and older logged
   sites. Recently cut sites had significantly larger inorganic N pools
   than undamaged forests, although total net nitrogen (N) mineralization
   rates were not significantly different among treatments. Nitrification
   rates of 0.2 kg ha(-1) day(-1) measured in the oldest cuts were three
   times greater than in HWA-damaged sites and over 200 times greater than
   in undamaged hemlock sites. However, resin bag capture in the older cuts
   was similar to amounts captured in undamaged and damaged forests,
   suggesting that excess nitrogen was being utilized in vegetative uptake.
   In contrast, relatively large amounts of ammonium and nitrate captured
   in recent harvests indicate higher N availability, less vegetative
   uptake, and a greater potential for N leaching.
   Main conclusions Results suggest that both the decline associated with
   HWA infestation and the indirect effects of HWA in the form of logging
   are generating profound changes in structure, composition, and ecosystem
   function in these forests, although at different spatial and temporal
   scales. Hemlock harvesting imposed more abrupt microenvironmental
   changes, and rapidly reduced vegetative cover while chronic HWA
   infestation led to gradually thinning canopies. Both disturbances led to
   black birch dominated forests, although logging resulted in greater
   amounts of shade-intolerant regeneration, higher soil pH and
   nitrification rates, and reduced forest floor mass. Pre-emptive cutting
   of undamaged forests may lead to greater N losses than those associated
   with HWA infestation or logging of deteriorated hemlock forests, because
   of reduced vegetative uptake. Silvicultural methods that allow for
   vegetation establishment prior to harvesting will probably lessen the
   ecological impacts of hemlock removal.}},

Abstract = {{Aim This study examines changes in avian community composition
   associated with the decline and loss of eastern hemlock {[}Tsuga

   Location The study was conducted in a 4900-km(2) study region extending
   from Long Island Sound northward to the southern border of Massachusetts
   and including the Connecticut River Valley in Connecticut, USA.
   Methods Bird surveys were conducted at 40 points in 12 hemlock stands
   varying in HWA infestation and overstory mortality levels during the
   avian breeding seasons of 2000 and 2001. Ten-minute, 50-m radius point
   counts were used to survey all birds seen or heard at each point.
   Overstory and understory vegetation were sampled at each point.
   Indicator species analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling were
   used to examine relationships between avian community composition and
   vegetation structure.
   Results Overstory hemlock mortality was highly correlated with avian
   community composition. Abundance of eastern wood-pewee (Contopus
   virens), brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), tufted titmouse
   (Baeolophus bicolor), white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis),
   red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus), hooded warbler (Wilsonia citrina), and
   several woodpecker species was highest at points with >60\% mortality.
   Black-throated green warbler (Dendroica virens), Acadian flycatcher
   (Empidonax virescens), blackburnian warbler (Dendroica fusca), and
   hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus) were strongly associated with intact
   hemlock stands that exhibit little or no mortality from HWA.
   Conclusions Eastern hemlock has unique structural characteristics that
   provide important habitat for numerous bird species in the north-eastern
   US. As a result, removal of hemlock by HWA has profound effects on avian
   communities. Black-throated green warbler, blackburnian warbler, and
   Acadian flycatcher are very strongly associated with hemlock forests in
   southern New England and appear to be particularly sensitive to hemlock
   removal. The hooded warbler, a species whose status is of regional
   concern, may actually benefit from the development of a dense hardwood
   seedling layer associated with high hemlock mortality.}},

   have affected chestnut distribution and life history.
   Location The study focuses on chestnut in Connecticut and Massachusetts
   but includes analysis of data related to other Castanea species in North
   America and Europe.
   Methods The ecology and palaeoecology of chestnut is investigated using
   a range of techniques, including examination of the growth form of
   chestnut trees in plantations located away from blight, mapping of
   chestnut sprouts and blight-killed trees at various locations,
   anatomical examination of chestnut stems, analysis of early forestry
   practices, identification of changes in the relative abundance of
   chestnut pollen in Holocene lake sediments and comparison of American
   chestnut with other Castanea species.
   Results Examination of chestnut sprouts surviving in the former range of
   that species shows that most sprouts originated from suppressed
   seedlings and that environmental factors severely limited the survival
   of sprouts from large blight-killed trees. Palynological data show that
   chestnut was either present in very low populations or entirely absent
   from New England and only became abundant after about 2500 years ago.
   All factors suggest that chestnut abundance is related to the natural
   disturbance cycle, while human-induced transformations of the landscape
   and the introduction of chestnut blight have further transformed the
   character of chestnut in New England.
   Main conclusions Most surviving chestnut sprouts in New England forests
   represent old seedlings that have continued to re-sprout since
   establishment before the introduction of blight nearly 100 years ago.
   The growth form of these sprouts ensures a minimal substrate of bark
   tissue for blight establishment so that blight has a relatively minor
   effect on seedling-sprout survival. The identification of modern
   chestnut sprouts as old seedlings indicates that the observed
   distribution of sprouts in New England woodlands is strongly influenced

   and shrubland communities that are high priorities for conservation in
   the north-eastern US and support numerous globally rare species. Such an

   conservation and management approaches for these communities.
   Location The study area encompasses the coastal region that extends from
   Cape Cod, MA to Long Island, NY, including the islands of Nantucket,
   Martha's Vineyard, and Block Island.
   Methods In order to determine whether open-land habitats occurred in the
   study region prior to European arrival in the seventeenth century and to
   assess changes to these communities through the historical period, a
   wide range of palaeoecological, archaeological, ethno-historical,
   biological and field data were reviewed. Information about the history
   of human impacts on these communities was used to interpret landscape
   change over time and to evaluate current and potential conservation and
   management approaches.
   Results The region was predominantly wooded prior to widespread
   Euro-American land clearing beginning in the seventeenth century, with
   some areas of early successional habitats, primarily on exposed sites
   and near Native American settlements. Grasslands, heathlands and
   shrublands increased dramatically as a result of intensive and primarily
   agricultural disturbance through the historical period. The decline in
   recent decades of these communities results from extensive residential
   and commercial development, and from widespread abandonment of
   traditional agricultural practices, especially intensive grazing.
   Main conclusions Despite considerable uncertainty as to the pre-European
   distribution and abundance of species characteristic of grasslands,
   heathlands and shrublands, historical disturbances have been

Abstract = {{As the concepts of landscape ecology have been incorporated into other
   disciplines, the influence of spatial patterns on animal abundance and
   distribution has attracted considerable attention. However, there
   remains a significant gap in the application of landscape ecology
   theories and techniques to wildlife research. By combining landscape
   ecology techniques with traditional wildlife habitat analysis methods,
   we defined an `organism-centered perspective' for breeding bald eagles
   (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) along the Hudson River, New York, USA. We
   intensively monitored four pairs of breeding eagles during the 1999 and
   2000 breeding seasons, and collected detailed information on perch and
   forage locations. Our analysis focused on three critical habitat
   elements: available perch trees, access to foraging areas, and freedom
   from human disturbance. We hypothesized that eagle habitat selection
   relative to each of these elements would vary with the spatial scale of
   analysis, and that these scaling relationships would vary among habitat
   elements. We investigated two elements of spatial scale: grain and local
   extent. Grain was defined as the minimum mapping unit; local extent was
   defined by the size of an analysis window placed around each focal
   point. For each habitat element, we quantified habitat use over a range
   of spatial scales. Eagles displayed scale-dependent patterns of habitat
   use in relation to all habitat features, including multi-scale and
   threshold-like patterns. This information supports the existence of
   scale-dependant relationships in wildlife habitat use and allowed for a
   more accurate and biologically relevant evaluation of Hudson River
   breeding eagle habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion approximation (DA) methods provide a powerful tool for
   population viability analysis (PVA) using simple time series of
   population counts. The e methods have a strong theoretical foundation
   based on stochastic age-structured models, but their application to data
   with high sampling error or age-structure cycles has been problematic.
   Recently, a new method was developed for estimating DA parameters from
   highly corrupted time series. We conducted an extensive cross-validation
   of this new method using 189 long-term time series of salmon counts with
   very high sampling error and nonstable age-structure fluctuations.
   Parameters were estimated from one segment of a time series, and a
   subsequent segment was used to evaluate the predictions regarding the
   risk of crossing population thresholds. We also tested the theoretical
   distributions of the estimated parameters. The distribution of parameter
   estimates is an essential aspect of a PVA because it-allows one to
   calculate confidence levels for risk metrics. This study is the first
   data-based cross-validation of these theoretical distributions. Our
   cross-validation analyses found that, when parameterization methods
   designed for corrupted data sets are used, DA predictions are very
   robust even for problematic data. Estimates of the probability of

Abstract = {{Aim The research explores how changes in disturbance regime resulting
   from human settlement may affect landscape structure. A spatially
   explicit grid-based simulation model is used to explore the interplay
   between humans, fire regime and landscape composition.
   Location The study site for this research is the botanical reserve at
   Mont Do, New Caledonia. The endemic conifer Araucaria laubenfelsii
   (Araucariaceae) forms a key component of the landscape at Mont Do. This
   species is unusual in that it is found scattered as an emergent in
   maquis and as a canopy species in adjacent rain forest patches. Although
   now dominated by a low maquis, prior to human settlement of New
   Caledonia, montane landscapes such as Mont Do are likely to have been
   heavily forested.
   Methods A spatially explicit simulation model, based on field data and
   palaeoecological information, was used to explore interactions between
   disturbance regime and the landscape. The model is described briefly
   here and more fully in Perry \& Enright (2002) Ecological Modelling ,
   152 , 279.
   Results The model suggests that human-influenced changes to the fire
   regime at Mont Do have been important in generating the current
   landscape structure. The origin and maintenance of forest landscapes and
   maquis-forest mosaic landscapes are considered in the context of
   alternative stable states. Strong feedback loops between fire size and
   landscape composition, mediated at the smaller scale by other similar
   mechanisms, are capable of driving landscape change. The utility of a
   spatial state and transition modelling approach is demonstrated.
   Main conclusions The current landscape pattern on Mont Do is likely the
   result of changes to the fire regime occurring since human settlement.
   The specific mechanisms for this change outlined here may occur in a
   number of other similar systems. Understanding the origin and
   persistence of these `fire landscapes' in New Caledonia and in the
   south-west Pacific in general is crucial for their effective management.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Aim (1) To review briefly global biogeographical patterns in dung
   beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae), a group whose
   evolutionary history has been dominated by ecological specialization to
   vertebrate dung in warmer climates. (2) To develop hypotheses accounting
   for the evolution of these patterns.
   Location Six principal biogeographical regions: Palaearctic, Oriental,
   Afrotropical, Australasia, Neotropical, Nearctic and five outlying
   islands or island groups harbouring endemic genera: Caribbean,
   Madagascar, Mauritius, New Caledonia, New Zealand.
   Methods Major patterns of tribal, generic and species distribution are
   investigated using cluster analysis, ordination, parsimony analysis of
   endemism and track analysis. Attempts are made to resolve
   biogeographical patterns with findings in the fields of plate tectonics,
   fossil and evolutionary history, plus phylogeny of both mammals and dung
   beetles.
   Results Because of conflict between published findings, it is uncertain
   at what point in time density of dinosaur dung, mammal dung or both
   became sufficiently great to select for specialized habits in dung
   beetles. However, biogeographical evidence would suggest a Mesozoic
   origin followed by further taxonomic radiation during the Cenozoic,
   possibly in response to the increasing size and diversity of mammalian
   dung types in South America and Afro-Eurasia. Proportional generic
   distribution in fourteen tribes and subtribes showed four principal
   biogeographical patterns: (1) southerly biased Gondwanaland
   distribution, (2) Americas or (3) Madagascar endemism, and (4) northerly
   biased, Afro-Eurasian-centred distribution with limited numbers of
   genera also widespread in other regions. Proportional composition of
   faunas in eleven geographical regions indicated three principal
   distributional centres, East Gondwanaland fragments, Afro-Eurasia and
   the Americas. These patterns probably result from three principal
   long-term range expansion and vicariance events (Mesozoic: Gondwanaland
   interchange and fragmentation, Cenozoic: Afro-Eurasian/Nearctic
   interchange and the Great American interchange). It is suggested that
   old vicariance caused by the Mesozoic fragmentation of Gondwanaland
   leads to a high degree of regional endemism at generic or tribal level
   across one or more Gondwanaland tracks. In contrast, it is suggested
   that the more recent Cenozoic range expansions occurred primarily
   towards northern regions leading to endemism primarily at species level.
   These Cenozoic radiations were facilitated by the re-linking of
   continents, either because of tectonic plate movements (Africa to
   Eurasia in Miocene), climatically induced sea-level change (Afro-Eurasia
   to Nearctic in Miocene and Pleistocene), or similar coupled with
   orogenics (Nearctic to Neotropical in Pliocene). Speciation has followed
   vicariance either because of climatic change or physical barrier
   development. These recent range expansions probably occurred principally
   along an Afro-Eurasian land track to the Nearctic and Neotropical and an
   Americas land track northwards from the Neotropics to the Nearctic, with
   limited dispersal from Eurasia to Australia, probably across a sea
   barrier. This accounts for the overall, spatially constrained,
   biogeographical pattern comprising large numbers of species-poor genera
   endemic to a single biogeographical region and fewer more species-rich
   genera, many of which show wider biogeographical distributions. In most
   southerly regions (Australasia, Madagascar, Neotropical), faunal
   composition and generic endemism is primarily dominated by elements with
   Gondwanaland ancestry, which is consistent with the Gondwanaland origin
   claimed for Scarabaeinae. In Afro-Eurasia (Palaearctic, Oriental,
   Afrotropical), generic endemism of monophyletically derived
   Afro-Eurasian and widespread lineages is centred in the Afrotropical
   region and faunal composition is numerically dominated by Afro-Eurasian
   and widespread elements. In the Nearctic region, the fauna is jointly
   dominated by widespread elements, derived from Afro-Eurasia, and
   Gondwanaland and Americas elements derived from the Neotropical region.
   Main conclusions Global biogeographical patterns in scarabaeine dung
   beetles primarily result from Mesozoic and Cenozoic range expansion
   events followed by vicariance, although recent dispersal to Australia
   may have occurred across sea barriers. Detailed phylogenetics research
   is required to provide data to support dispersal/vicariance hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term responses of forests to atmospheric CO2 enrichment have
   been difficult to determine experimentally given the large scale and
   complex structure of their canopy. We have developed a CO2 exposure
   system that uses the free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) approach but was
   designed for tall canopy trees. The system consists of a CO2-release
   system installed within the crown of adult trees using a 45-m tower
   crane, a CO2 monitoring system and an automated regulation system. Pure
   CO2 gas is released from a network of small tubes woven into the forest
   canopy (web-FACE), and CO2 is emitted from small laser-punched holes.
   The set point CO2 concentration ({[}CO2]) of 500 mumol mol(-1) is
   controlled by a pulse-width modulation routine that adjusts the rate of
   CO2 injection as a function of measured {[}CO2] in the canopy. CO2
   consumption for the enrichment of 14 tall canopy trees was about 2 tons
   per day over the whole growing season. The seasonal daytime mean CO2
   concentration was 520 mumol mol(-1). One-minute averages of CO2
   measurements conducted at canopy height in the center of the
   CO2-enriched zone were within +/-20\% and +/-10\% of the target
   concentration for 76\% and 47\% of the exposure time, respectively.
   Despite the size of the canopy and the windy site conditions,
   performance values correspond to about 75\% of that reported for
   conventional forest FACE with the added advantage of a much simpler and
   less intrusive infrastructure. Stable carbon isotope signals captured by
   80 Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) seedlings distributed within the
   canopy of treated and control tree districts showed a clearly delineated
   area, with some nearby individuals having been exposed to a gradient of
   {[}CO2], which is seen as added value. Time-integrated values of {[}CO2]
   derived from the C isotope composition of C. dactylon leaves indicated a
   mean (+/-SD) concentration of 513 +/- 63 mumol mol(-1) in the web-FACE
   canopy area. In view of the size of the forest and the rough natural
   canopy, web-FACE is a most promising avenue towards natural forest
   experiments, which are greatly needed.}},

   5 residual dry matter (RDM) treatment levels representative of the range

   Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis correctly classified
   63\% of TWINSPAN-created vegetation transitions among states with

   factors. The RDM variable (a surrogate for grazing intensity) was

   intensity manipulation creates distinctive community structure was
   restricted in application to a few sites. The results suggest that
   equilibrium models may be appropriate for predicting system productivity

Abstract = {{Tidal flow to salt marshes throughout the northeastern United States is
   often restricted by roads, dikes, impoundments, and inadequately sized
   culverts or bridge openings, resulting in altered ecological structure
   and function. In this study we evaluated the response of vegetation and
   nekton (fishes and decapod crustaceans) to restoration of full tidal
   flow to a portion of the Sachuest Point salt marsh, Middletown, Rhode
   Island. A before, after, control, impact study design was used,
   including evaluations of the tide-restricted marsh, the same marsh after
   reintroduction of tidal flow (i.e., tide-restored marsh), and an
   unrestricted control marsh. Before tidal restoration vegetation of the
   3.7-ha tide-restricted marsh was dominated by Phragmites australis and
   was significantly different from the adjacent 6.3-ha Spartina -dominated
   unrestricted control marsh (analysis of similarities randomization test,
   p < 0.001). After one growing season vegetation of the tide-restored
   marsh had changed from its pre-restoration condition (analysis of
   similarities randomization test, p < 0.005). Although not similar to the
   unrestricted control marsh, Spartina patens and S. alterniflora
   abundance increased and abundance and height of Phragmites significantly
   declined, suggesting a convergence toward typical New England salt marsh
   vegetation. Before restoration shallow water habitat (creeks and pools)
   of the unrestricted control marsh supported a greater density of nekton
   compared with the tide-restricted marsh (analysis of variance, p <
   0.001), but after one season of restored tidal flow nekton density was
   equivalent. A similar trend was documented for nekton species richness.
   Nekton density and species richness from marsh surface samples were
   similar between the tide-restored marsh and unrestricted control marsh.
   Fundulus heteroclitus and Palaemonetes pugio were the numerically
   dominant fish and decapod species in all sampled habitats. This study
   provides an example of a quantitative approach for assessing the
   response of vegetation and nekton to tidal restoration.}},

Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Empirical studies of life histories often ignore stochastic variation,
   despite theoretical demonstrations of its potential impact on
   life-history evolution. Here we use a novel approach to explore the
   effects of stochastic variation on life-history evolution and estimate
   the selection pressures operating on the monocarpic perennial Carlina
   vulgaris, in which flowering may be delayed by up to eight years. The
   approach is novel in that we use modern theoretical techniques to
   estimate selection pressures and the fitness landscape from a fully
   parameterised individual-based model. These approaches take into account
   temporal variation in demographic rates and density dependence. Analysis
   of 16 years' data revealed significant temporal variation in growth,
   mortality, and recruitment in our study population. Flowering was
   strongly size dependent and, unusually for such a species, also age
   dependent. Individual-based models of the flowering strategy,
   parameterized using field data, consistently underestimated the size at
   flowering, when temporal variation in demographic rates was ignored. In
   contrast, models that incorporated temporal variation in growth,
   mortality, and recruitment predicted sizes at flowering not
   significantly different from those observed in the field. Temporal
   variation in mortality, which had the largest effect on the flowering
   strategy, selected for increased size at flowering. An analytical
   approximation is presented to explain this result, extending the
   ``1-year look-ahead criterion{''} presented in Rees et al. (2000). A
   fitness landscape generated by following the fate of rare mutant
   invaders with a broad range of alternative flowering strategies
   demonstrated that the observed parameters were adaptive. However, the
   fitness landscape reveals that approximately equal fitness is achieved
   by a broad range of strategies, providing a mechanism for the
   maintenance of genetic variation. To understand how the different
   parameters that defined our models determine the fitness of rare
   mutants, we numerically estimated the elasticities and sensitivities of
   mutant fitness. This demonstrated strong selection on a number of the
   parameters. Elasticities and sensitivities estimated in constant and
   random environments were significantly positively correlated, and both
   were negatively related to the standard error of the parameter. This
   last result is surprising and, we argue, reflects the genetic and
   phenotypic responses to selection.}},
