However, doesnt data mining go against the rule that the chosen variables used in the FI calculation should represent the state of the system in question?"

https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3812(01)00677-X,2002,Cabezas and Fath,Fisher Information measure,fisher information measure,complex/dynamical systems,"""Fisher information is the maximum amount of information available from a set of observations, in this case, states of the system"". They use Predator-Prey models to demonstrate ow the average Fisher  Information (over the entire cycle) decreases as the mortality rate for prey increases. This is because the pred prey system in phase space exhibits a larger and more elliptical path than does a 'more stable' and less variable system with a lower prey mortality parameter."
https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-5193(03)00067-5,2003,Fath et al. ,Fisher Information ,derivatives,ecology,Authors use a Food Web model to demonstrate how a complex system with 'minimal complexity' can be analysed with Fisher Information. Authors suggest this thoery requires the system to be periodic (or at least dynamically stable) and that the window size needs to match the period size.

,1990,Freiden,Fisher disorder measure,disorder measure,physics,Isolated system defined by coordiante x has a PDF p(x). A functional of p(s) (called Fisher Information) is used to measure degree of disorder of the system due to the spread in p(x). FI can be minimized to attain an equilibrium solution p(x).
