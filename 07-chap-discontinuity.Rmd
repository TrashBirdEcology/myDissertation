## Introduction
Animal body mass distributions have been used to identify scaling structures of ecological communities [@allen2006discontinuities; @allen2002cross; @holling1992cross]. Using statistical methods to identify gaps, or discontinuities, in body mass distributions, some patterns are observed within and across taxonomic groups and biomes. Given the ubiquity of discontinuities identified in body mass distributions of fauna and social systems [@allen2006discontinuities], the ecological significance of these patterns may prove useful in understanding ecosystem structure and functioning [@angeler2016management]. Various hypotheses are posited as  drivers of the observed discontinuities in animal body mass distributions, including those related to resource use (the Energetic and Textural Discontinuity hypotheses), community interactions, biogeography, and evolution/phylogenetics  [@allen2006discontinuities; @holling1992cross; @blackburn1994animal; @allen2006patterns].

Body size influences the frequency and intensity of inter- and intraspecific competition for resources, territory, and mates, thereby dictating the spatial and temporal scales at which a species of a distinct body size operates [@peters1983effect;@silva1995allometric; @allen2006patterns]. The scaling structure of terrestrial communities are have been found to have 'lumpy' distributions; that is, they are not well-described using parametric statistical descriptions. If the scaling structure of a community manifests in the body mass distribution of the community, it is  considered reflective of the  discontinuous and heterogeneous nature of resource use. Specifically, @holling1992cross suggests that the body mass distribution of a community or group of species reflects the discontinuous nature of environmental structures and processes. Quantitative analyses of animal body sizes [@allen2006patterns;@nash2014habitat] and other similar distributions has revealed the ubiquity of the discontinuous nature of distributions of animal body masses [@skillen2008ecological; @havlicek2001pelagic], plant biomass [@spanbauer2016body], city population sizes [@garmestani2005time], and animal home range sizes [@restrepo2008discontinuities]. 

Avian distribution and presence data are abundant, easily accessible and, more importantly, provide insights into resource availability and structure at the local and landscape scales. In this Chapter I used discontinuity analysis of avian body mass distributions to identify the scaling structures of local avian communities in the Prairie Potholes, Central Mixed Grass, and Eastern Tall Grass regions of the central Great Plains of North America. I then use linear mixed modelling to determine whether the body mass distributions of these avian communities exhibit change corresponding to the spatial boundaries recently proposed in [@roberts2019shifting]. Although I found evidence supporting the hypothesis that declining grassland birds operate near the 'edges' of body mass aggregations, which represent the spatiotemporal scaling of resource use and availability, I did not identify shifts in the body mass distributions corresponding with the previously proposed pole ward, spatial shifts.

### Study area
A recent study [@roberts2019shifting] identified what they refer to as spatial regimes across a large portion of the central United States (see Figure \@ref(fig:studyarea)) using inference gained from discontinuity analyses of avian body mass distributions. The authors hypothesize that a spatial regime boundary exists in the Central Great Plains and suggests it has exhibited a Northward shift at a rate of  $\sim\frac{0.05^\circ\ latitude}{year}$. The authors used discontinuity analysis to identify these 'spatial regimes', using the body masses of breeding birds. Their hypothesized spatial regime boundary occurs at $39^\circ$ latitude in year 1970, $39.5^\circ$ latitude  in year 1985, $40^\circ$ latitude in year 2000, and $40.5^\circ$ latitude in year 2015 (see Figure \@ref(fig:routesWithSpatRegimes)). Sampling sites were classified each year as belonging to either the Southern or Northern regime according to whether the location was below (Southern) or above (Northern)  the regimes identified by @roberts2019shifting.


The study area is designed such that there is minimal crossing of very different BCR, or habitat types (Figure \@ref(fig:studyarea)). In other words, this study area largely falls within BCRs which can be generally classified as grassland habitat (BCR 11, Prairie Potholes; BCR 19, Central Mixed Grass ; BCR 22, Eastern Tall Grass). Using this design we should expect that the functional groups within our avian communities should be similar across BCR boundaries, despite a potential turnover in species identity. Accounting for change in habitat across space allows us to assume that any observed change in the scaling structure of the avian community is due to changes in habitat and resource availability such that similar species are or are not included in the community. 

### Data
#### Avian census data - North American Breeding Bird Survey
I constructed body mass distributions using route-level data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey hereafter [NABBS; @sauer2017results]. The NABBS uses citizen scientist volunteers to annually collect data using a standardized roadside, single observer, 3-minute point count protocol and has organized data collection annually across North America (Figure \@ref(fig:bbsPoints)) since 1966. Each roadside survey consists of 50, 3-minute point counts (data collected using sight and sound) along  $\sim24.5$ mile stretch of road. Although the point counts are designed to collect estimates of relative abundance, the method for building body mass distributions used in this chapter require only presence absence data. I therefore converted abundances to presence-absence data. I considered a species as 'present' if it was detected on the year in question or the $\pm 1$ year to account for potential false negative observations (i.e., a species was not detected in the NABBS route despite its presence in the local community). 

##### Identifying avian census locations
To determine whether the spatial regime shifts identified in @roberts2019shifting manifested in local avian community structure, I restricted analysis to the grassland habitat of the Central Great Plains. All routes falling within a rectangular area bounded by coordinates $37.8^\circ$ and $44.5^\circ$ latitude, and $-101^\circ$ and $-95.5^\circ$ longitude [see Figure \@ref(fig:routesWithSpatRegimes)]. I retained all NABBS routes which used the sampling protocol '101', which is the standard method for conducting NABBS point count surveys. 

##### Avian body mass data
Species operating at similar spatial and temporal scales are those which are close in body size as identified using statistical aggregation identification techniques [@allen1999body]. The interactions among species within a single body mass aggregation are presumed to experience a higher frequency and intensity of interspecific interactions with each other as opposed to those in different aggregations [@peterson1998ecological]. Although some species of birds are sexually size dimorphic, I am unaware of any sexually size-dimorphic birds that would likely operate at different spatial and temporal. Therefore,  I constructed body mass distributions of each avian census using the sex-averaged body masses published in @dunning2007crc (available for [download at CRC press](https://www.crcpress.com/CRC-Handbook-of-Avian-Body-Masses/Dunning-Jr/p/book/9781420064445)).

##### Removing species from analysis
Due to strict reliance on volunteers, some routes are not covered every year. Although NABBS volunteers attempt identify all species in the point-count area,  biases exist in data collection. Rather than retain observations of cryptic or species with low detection rates, I removed select species from the censuses (see Methods section in Chapter \@ref(fisherSpatial) for further discussion of this topic). I analyzed species of the following taxonomic families: Accipitriformes, Apodiformes, Cathartiformes, Charadriiformes, Columbiformes, Coraciiformes, Cuculiformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes, Passeriformes and Piciformes. Although removing cryptic, nocturnal, and some crepuscular species (e.g. Caprimulgiformes) from the analysis may yield a more conservative body mass distribution, including them may result in correctly identifying additional scaling structures (or body mass aggregations) in some routes but not in others. This method of exclusion also results in a loss of some medium- and larger-bodied Ciconiiformes (Podicipediformes, Phoenicopteriformes, Ciconiiformes; e.g. grebes, pelicans).

##### Taxonomic munging of the census data
Although the NABBS survey reports species-specific abundances, some birds are only classified to genera or order. Common examples of these species are those which are nearly indistinguishable from each other (e.g., Glossy Ibis and White-faced Ibis), birds which are difficult to see under certain conditions (e.g., hummingbirds, fast-moving hawks or accipiters), or species whose songs are similar. Numerous species were presented as identified to family or genus (e.g., Accipiter sp., Buteo sp., and Trochilids sp.) and others are categorized as hybrid. 

I made decisions regarding species-specific classification based on the North American breeding range maps provided by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Many unidentified species were easily categorized given the lack of overlap in species' ranges in our study area. For example, *Baeolophus bicolor* is nearly indistinguishable from *Baeolophus atricristatus*, however *B. atricristatus* is not known to occur in our study area (Figure \@ref(fig:studyarea))--therefore all accounts classified as either *B. bicolor* or *B. atricristatus* were classified as the former. This example occurred for. Informed decisions like of this nature were made regarding the following unidentified species, where the second name in the binomial was assigned as the species preceding the "/": *Passerina cyanea / amoena*, *Corvus brachyrhynchos / ossifragus*, *Petrochelidon pyrrhonota / fulva*, *Corvus brachyrhynchos*, *Quiscalus major / mexicanus*, *Pipilo maculatus / erythrophthalmus*, *Sturnella magna / neglect*, *Plegadis chihi / falcinellus*, *Coccyzus erythropthalmus / americanus*, *Empidonax traillii / alnorum*, *Icterus galbula / bullockii*, *Nyctanassa nycticorax / violacea*, and *Poecile atricapillus / carolinensis* were all classified according to their known distributions. I classified unidentified hummingbirds (*Trochilid* sp.) as *Selasphorus rufus*,and unidentified Terns (Tern sp.) as *Childonias niger*. All unidentified Accipiters (Accipiter sp.), Buteos (Buteo sp.), and Gulls (Gull sp.) were removed from analysis entirely as there are no clear differences in the probability of occurrence in our study area.

```

#### Identifying species of interest
@allen2006patterns propose alternative hypotheses for the relative locations of species within the body mass aggregation distributions as a function of 'distance-to-edge', a measure indicating the distance (in log-mass units) of each species to the edge of a body mass aggregation. This distance-to-edge measure is zero when the species falls at the edge of a statistically identified body mass aggregation. This species is often referred to as an 'edge species'. To determine the effect of spatial regime shifts on edge species, I identified three types of species of interest: (1) grassland obligates species, (2) species with widespread population declines in the study area, and (3) a combination of these groups. All remaining species were classified as 'other'.

##### Grassland obligate species 
The spatial regimes identified in @roberts2019shifting are attributed to large-scale changes in the landscape, including woody plant invasion. The loss of native grassland in our study area due to land conversion is largely attributed to anthropogenic land use change (e.g., development) and fire suppression. Numerous species have been negatively impacted by this widespread habitat loss, but grassland obligates are particularly at risk. Grassland obligates should be strong indicators of the large-scale spatial regime shifts identified in @roberts2019shifting, given their high sensitivity to grassland habitat loss [@herkert1994effects]. I identified North American grassland obligate species from the grey literature [@shriver2005distribution; @north2009state] and white literature [@peterjohn1999population]. Although some grassland obligates were positively impacted by the Conservation Reserve Program [CRP; @peterjohn1999population], this group of birds exhibited strong declines in North America until approximately 2003, coinciding with the recent adoption of the Farm Bill [@north2009state].

##### Declining species
I classified a species as 'declining' based on the results of the North American Breeding Bird Survey [@sauer2017results]. The Patuxent Wildlife Research Center uses hierarchical modelling techniques to estimate the trends of species using the NABBS data at various spatial scales. @sauer2017results also provides estimates of data credibility  according to data availability, number of routes used to build the population trend estimate, abundance, and probability of detecting a small change in population trend. These credibility scores are generated for multiple  spatial extents: state-level, BCR-level, and across the three regions of the United States (Western, Central, and Eastern). Given the extent of this study, I considered the data credibility estimates using the Central Breeding Bird Survey Region, the Prairie Pothole BCR (BCR 11) and Eastern Tallgrass Prairie (BCR 22). A species was considered as declining only if the trend estimate was categorized as having moderate precision and abundance (blue) or having a deficiency (yellow). I considered the population trend estimates provided for the period of 1966 - 2015. 

### Statistical analysis
#### Identifying scaling structure of avian communities using body mass distributions 
Discontinuities in body mass distributions been quantified using various methods (e.g., multivariate time series models, regression trees, and gap rarity index)  which are collectively referred to as 'discontinuity analyses' [@nash2014discontinuities; @barichievy2018method; @stow2007evaluating; @allen2006discontinuities]. Using various methods, the discontinuous nature of body masses of ecological communities is well-documented, having been observed in various taxa of both terrestrial [@allen2006patterns] and aquatic [@spanbauer2016body] communities. Multiple methods are proposed for identifying discontinuities in body mass aggregations [@allen2001cross], including clustering algorithms [@stow2007evaluating], body mass difference indices [@holling1992cross], gap rarity index [@restrepo2008discontinuities], and more recently the discontinuity detector [@barichievy2018method], an extension of the gap rarity index [@restrepo2008discontinuities]. 

I used the discontinuity detector described in @barichievy2018method, which uses likelihood to determine whether the observed data contains multiple modes as compared to that of a Gaussian (uni-modal) distribution. This method requires multiple user-defined parameters, including an imputation resolution (1000) and a bootstrap sample size (1000) over which the null distribution is randomly sampled. I provided a slightly altered and annotated version of the functions `Neutral.Null` and `Bootstrap.Gaps` (first printed in @barichievy2018method) used to identify discontinuities in a continuous variable in Appendix \@ref(appDiscont). 
Two criterion have been used to determining the exact location of discontinuities within a rank-ordered continuous variable: using a constant significance/threshold level [@barichievy2018method] and a power constant table for varying sample sizes [@roberts2019shifting]. It should be noted because the power-constant method identifies a larger proportion of "significant" discontinuities, or edges, identifying aggregations requires subjective measures regarding actual aggregation locations. Using the percentile method avoids this subjectivity, however, the aggregation number and locations are sensitive to choice of percentile or threshold value. Following the methods of @barichievy2018method I considered a value to be a discontinuity if the gap percentile (see Appendix \@ref(appDiscont) was $\geq 90%$. 
I built route-level body mass distributions for each route-year combination by using presence absence data from the current, previous, and following year to account for observational and process errors impacting the detectability of a species within a single route. Using this method reduces the amount of species-specific, and consequently specific-body mas turnover within a route over time. This also assumes that an unobserved species is truly absent, an assumption which is difficult to avoid without a sophisticated occupancy modelling approach for each species in the community.

#### Determining Effects of a Spatial Regime Boundary on Grassland Birds
If the spatial regime shift occurred in the bird community, it should manifest in the local community scaling structure through one or both of species turnover and a shift in the number of body mass aggregations. I used linear mixed modelling to determine whether the local scaling structure and the location of grassland obligates and declining species within these scaling structures are impacted by the spatial regime boundaries proposed by  @roberts2019shifting. 

I used a linear mixed model to determine whether the proposed moving spatial regime boundaries influenced the location of species of interest (grassland obligates, declining species) within their respective body mass aggregation. Each species was assigned a 'distance to  edge', which served as a proxy of the proximity of a species to the nearest edge of its respective body mass aggregation. Previous studies suggest that this distance to edge measure can be used to identify zones of transitions, as invasive and threatened species tend to be located at the edges of aggregations [@allen1999body]. Following this hypothesis, one should expect to see changes in the locations of sensitive and declining species change in the areas undergoing so called spatial-regime shift zones [@roberts2019shifting]. 
```{r sppIntTab, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
sppIntDat <- readRDS(here::here("chapterFiles/discontinuityAnalysis/results/mixedModel-dataUsed.RDS")) %>% 
  distinct(commonName, sppGroup) %>% 
  arrange(desc(sppGroup))%>%

#       booktabs=TRUE) 
```

I modelled the 'distance to edge' for each species as a function of time, whether the NABBS route is in the 'Southern' or 'Northern' spatial regime [South or North of the boundaries proposed in @roberts2019shifting; see Figure \@ref(fig:routesWithSpatRegimes)], time, route identity, and a descriptive group (one of grassland obligate, declining, declining grassland obligate, other). The 'distance to edge' response variable was not strongly correlated with body mass (Figure \@ref(fig:aggEdgeCorrPlot)), however, I scaled and centered the  response values to avoid obtaining predictions lower than zero for the unscaled response. 

Fixed effects included an interaction among year ($\beta_{1i}$) and regime location ($\beta_{2i}$), and an interaction among regime ($\beta_{2i}$) and species group ($\beta_{3}$). Random intercepts were estimated for each species ($b_1$) within each NABBS route ($b_2$). That is, species was nested within route. An auto-regressive lag-1 correlation structure was assumed for the random intercept estimates. The model was fitted using restricted maximum likelihood. The model was fitted using `nlme::lme` and was coded as:
>  nlme::lme( distEdge.scaled ~ year.center \* regime + regime \* sppGroup, 
     random = ~ 1 | loc/aou, correlation = corAR1(form = ~ 1 | loc / aou ), method = "REML")

### Summary statistics of censuses (NABBS data)  
Given the location of the study area (Figure \@ref(fig:studyarea)) with respect to the location of the contiguous Central Great Plains, fewer NABBS routes falling into the Southern regime were analysed than those in the Northern (Table \@ref(tab:nRtesPerRegimePerYearTab)).  Likely due to the increase in the total number of routes surveyed over time across the entire North American Breeding Bird Survey region, species richness increased over time within our study area (Figure \@ref(fig:richnessByYear)). Annual turnover rates were relatively low but became more dispersed over time (Figure \@ref(fig:turnoverByYear); Table \@ref(tab:richTurnTab)).

#### Species of interest
A total of `r nrow(sppIntDat)` species were considered for analysis across the entire study area. `r nrow(sppIntDat[sppIntDat$'Species Group' =="Grassland Obligates",]) + nrow(sppIntDat[sppIntDat$'Species Group' =="Declining Grassland Obligates",])` were classified as grassland obligate species, or species deemed highly sensitive to changes in amount and quality of grassland habitat. Of the grassland obligates, `r nrow(sppIntDat[sppIntDat$'Species Group' =="Declining Grassland Obligates",])` were considered as declining species. An additional `r nrow(sppIntDat[sppIntDat$'Species Group' =="Declining",])` species were classified as non-grassland obligate and declining (Table \@ref(tab:sppIntTab)).

The total (Figure \@ref(fig:stopTotalSum)) and mean (Figure \@ref(fig:stopTotalMean)) number of birds counted within each species group was relatively constant across time in the Prairie Potholes and Eastern Tallgrass Prairie bird conservation regions, but fluctuation in stop totals appeared greater in the Badlands and Prairies BCR (Figures \@ref(fig:stopTotalMean), \@ref(fig:stopTotalSum))). The latter BCR comprises a much smaller portion of the study area (Figure \@ref(fig:studyarea)) and accordingly the coefficient of variation (CV; ratio of deviation to the mean) around the stop totals (Figure \@ref(fig:stopTotalCV)) was highest in this region. It is worth noting the high CV (CV is considered low when $<\ \sim40%$) in all regions.

### Statistical Analysis
#### Identifying scaling structure in body mass distributions
Discontinuity analysis was conducted to identify the aggregations in the body mass distributions of `r n_distinct(dat$loc)` routes over a `r max(dat$year) - min(dat$year)` period across the Central Great Plains (Figure \@ref(fig:studyarea))). Discontinuity analysis suggested discontinuities existed in all routes analysed, and were relatively similar within NABBS routes over time. The number of body mass aggregations identified within each NABBS route using the discontinuity detector [@barichievy2018method] was similar was similar across time (Figure \@ref(fig:nAggsPerYear)a) and was approximately normally distributed across all survey-year combinations ($\bar{x} =  4.7, \sigma = 1.6$; Figure \@ref(fig:nAggsPerYear)a). Species richness at the route level was strongly positively correlated with the number of aggregations  (Figure \@ref(fig:aggEdgeCorrPlot)). The distance to edge variable was statistically, but not strongly, correlated with body mass $r=-0.02, p = <0.01$, and this relationship was similar across species groups except grassland obligates. 
<!-- (Table \@ref(tab:corTabBySppGroup)).  -->

The discontinuities in the body mass distribution identified appeared relatively similar over time at most NABBS routes (Figure \@ref(fig:routeGapEx)). If the shifting spatial regimes proposed in an earlier study [@roberts2019shifting; Figure \@ref(fig:routesWithSpatRegimes)], then we should expect changes in the body mass distribution of NABBS falling within or near the regime boundary. This was not observed on the routes falling within this zone (Figure \@ref(fig:routeGapEx) is representative of the ~5 NABBS locations falling in this area of expected changes shifting).

  dplyr::select(-lower, -upper) 
row.names(est) <- row.names(varFix)

```

#### Linear Mixed Effects Analysis of Distance to Edge
Declining species and declining grassland obligate species were located closer to the edge than the 'other' species, while grassland obligate species were further from the edge than 'other' species (Table \@ref(tab:lmeTab)). Similar trends held for declining grassland obligates and grassland obligates in the Northern regime location. There was, however, no evidence to suggest additive effects of the regime  location or year, or their interactions  (Table \@ref(tab:lmeTab)).

## Discussion
South-North shifts in the past 50+ years have been demonstrated in large scale processes, including bird populations and ranges [@sorte2007poleward] and plant hardening zones [@mckenney2014change]. A recent application of discontinuities in  body mass distributions [@holling1992cross] corroborated these previous observations of large-scale changes as manifested in the avian community [@roberts2019shifting]. support for the hypothesis that declining species operate at the edges of body mass aggregations, but did not identify changes in the body mass distributions of avian communities near the proposed spatial regime boundary [@roberts2019shifting] proposed in  impact of these proposed spatial regime shifts on local bird communities

The lack of additive effects in the presence of multiplicative effects of the regime location (Table \@ref(tab:lmeTab)) strengthens the support for the differences in grassland obligates and declining grassland obligates with respect to all other species, however, the confidence intervals around the estimates of declining grassland obligates, grassland obligates may suggest that the evidence for such an effect is relatively weak (Figure \@ref(fig:intrxnPlot-regime)). This is unsurprising given the distribution of grassland obligate body masses is highly skewed right relative to the remaining species (Figures \@ref(fig:bmDistPerSppGroup)), \@ref(fig:bmDistPerSppGroup-byRegime))). Many grassland obligate species have small body masses, reducing the probability that they will appear in different body mass aggregations, however, depending on the local bird community identities, local grassland obligates may all have similar body masses, removing this effect. The larger, non-declining grassland obligates occur in a relatively small portion of our study area, Shortgrass Prairie BCR (Figures \@ref(fig:studyarea),\@ref(fig:bmDistPerSppGroup-byBCR)). 

Although the body mass distributions of terrestrial communities at small scales tends to differ from those at larger spatial scales [@blackburn1994animal], numerous studies confirm the evidence for 'discontinuities' in these distributions across multiple spatial scales for a variety of phenomenon [@wardwell2009variability; @allen1999body; @spanbauer2016body;@nash2014discontinuities; but see @siemann1999gaps;@bibi2019body; @manly1996there for applications yielding negative results]. This study found evidence supporting the hypothesis that scaling structures manifest in the body masses of fauna communities, adding to the growing number of case studies which suggest this phenomena is widespread across systems and scales.
