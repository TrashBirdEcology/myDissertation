## Introduction
Body size influences the frequency and intensity of inter- and intraspecific competition for resources, territory, and mates, thereby dictating the spatial and temporal scales at which a species of a distinct body size operates [@peters1983effect;@silva1995allometric; @allen2006patterns]. The scaling structure of terrestrial communities are have been found to have 'lumpy' distributions --- that is, they are not well-described using paramteric statistical descriptions. If the scaling structure of a community manifests in the body mass distribution of the community, it is  considered reflective of the  discontinuous and heterogeneous nature of resource use. Specifically, @holling1992cross suggests that the body mass distribution of a community or group of species reflects the discontinuous nature of environmental structures and processes. Quantitative analyses of animal body sizes [@allen2006patterns;@nash2014habitat] and other similar distributions has revealed the ubiquity of the discontinuous nature of distributions of animal body masses [@skillen2008ecological; @havlicek2001pelagic], plant biomass [@spanbauer2016body], city population sizes [@garmestani2005time], and animal home range sizes [@restrepo2008discontinuities]. 

Given the ubiquity of discontinuities in body mass distributions of fauna and social systems [@allen2009discontinuities], the ecological signifance of these patterns may prove useful in understanding ecosystem structure and functioning [@angeler2016management]. Various hypotheses are given for drivers of the discontinuous structure of animal body mass distributions including those related to resource use (the Energetic and Textural Discontinuity hypotheses), community interactions, biogeography, and evolution/phylogenetics  [@allen2006discontinuities; @holling1992cross; @blackburn1994animal; @allen2006patterns], and these hypotheses consecutively represent the spatial and temporal scales at which the system components operate. 
Discontinuities in body mass distributions been quantified using various methods (e.g., multivariate time series models, regression trees, and gap rarity index)  which are collectively referred to as 'discontinuity analyses' [@nash2014discontinuities; @barichievy2018method; @stow2007evaluating; @allen2009discontinuities]. Using various methods, the discontinuous nature of body masses of ecological communities is well-documented, having been observed in various taxa of both terrestrial [@allen2006patterns] and aquatic [@spanbauer2016body] communities. While identifying discontinuities in body mass aggregations and other systems is ubiquitous, much work is needed to sift through the hypotheses for drivers of these patterns [@allen2006patterns].

The goal of this Chapter is to determine if, under the assumption there exists a northward-shifting spatial regime in the Central Great Plains from 1970 to 2015 [@roberts2019shifting], local bird communities exhibited shifts in the scaling structure and whether vulnerable species were impacted by this shift. I use discontinuity analyses to determine whether large-scale shifts in the vegetative structure impact scale-specific structure (as manifested in body mass distributions) of local bird communities. As an extension of @allen1999body I test competing hypotheses for drivers of discontinuous body mass distributions by examining the location of vulnerable (declining) bird species within individual body mass aggregations. I found no evidence to support hypotheses for top-down influence of landscape-scale changes in vegetative structure on body mass distributions in my study area. I discuss the negative results and the potential limitations of this study and approach. 

## Methods
The Central Great Plains has undergone a large-scale and relatively rapid spread of a native invasive woody plant, the Eastern Redcedar [*Juniperus virginianus*; @van2009causes; @twidwell2016plant;@donovan2018social], influencing habitat and resource availablity for bird communities across multiple spatial scales [@chapman2004tree]. A recent decadal analysis [@roberts2019shifting] of avian body mass distributions suggets the avian communities within this study area underwent significant structural 'regime' shifts as a consequence of large-scale drivers including woody planty encroachment, and a climate change. Based on observed changes in the body mass distribution structure of avian communities the authors suggest a spatial regime boundary moved from approximately over a 30-year period. Here, I use determine the influence of their proposed moving spatial regime on local bird communities in a region of Kansas, U.S that is suggested to have undergone a regime shift. I achieve this by first identifying the scaling structure of the body mass distributions of local bird communities using discontinuity analysis. If the proposed regime shifts occurred at the larger spatial scales, then we should expect local-scale shifts to have occurred within the same time frame. I furhter examine the effect of the large-scale woody plant encroachment on the local avifauna by examining if and how vulnerable species (i.e. grassland obligates and other declining species) are impacted. Using the body mass distributions built from the entire local communities, I calculate the distance of these species-of-interest to the nearest 'edge' of a body mass aggregation. 

### Data
#### Study area
A recent study [@roberts2019shifting] identified what they refer to as spatial regimes across a large portion of the central United States [see Figure \@ref(fig:studyArea)]. Tue authors hypothesize that a spatial regime boundary exists in the Central Great Plains and suggests it has exhibited a Northward shift at a rate of  $\sim\frac{0.05^\circ\ latitude}{year}$. The authors used discontinuity analysis to identify these 'spatial regimes', using the body massess of breeding bird communities. Their hypothesized spatial regime boundary occurs at $39^\circ$ latitude in year 1970, $39.5^\circ$ latitude  in year 1985, $40^\circ$ latitude in year 2000, and $40.5^\circ$ latitude in year 2015 (see Figure \@ref(fig:routesWithSpatRegimes)). Sampling sites were classified each year as belonging to either the Southern or Northern regime according to whether the location was below (Southern) or above (Northern)  the regimes identified by @roberts2019shifting.
<!-- Large portions of this study area have experienced widespread shifts in a prolific native woody plant, Eastern Redcedar (*Juniperus virginianus*).  -->

#### Avian community census data
I constructed body mass distributions using route-level data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey hereafter [NABBS; @bbsData]. The NABBS uses citizen scientist volunteers to annually collect data using a standardized roadside, single observer, 3-minute point count protocol and has organized data collection annually across North America (Figure \@ref(fig:bbsPoints)) since 1966. Each roadside survey consists of 50, 3-minute point counts (data collected using sight and sound) along  $\sim24.5$ mile stretch of road. Although the point counts are designed to collect estimates of relative abundance, the method for building body mass distributions used in this chapter require only presence absence data. I therefore converted abundances to presence-absence data. I considered a species as 'present' if it was detected on the year in question or the $\pm 1$ year to account for potential false negative observations (i.e., a species was not detected in the NABBS route despite its presence in the local community). 

##### Selecting census locations
To determine whether the spatial regime shifts identified in @roberts2019shifting manifested in local avian community structure, I limited my analysis to the years and locations proposed as spatial regime locations by the authors. That is, I restricted analysis of avian censuses to years 1970, 1985, 2000, and 2015, and analysed only NABBS routes falling inside the area used in @roberts2019shifting: a rectangular area between $28^\circ$ and $49^\circ$ latitude, and  $-97^\circ$ and $-93^\circ$ longitude [see Figure \@ref(fig:routesWithSpatRegimes)]. 

#### Avian body masses
Species operating at similar spatial and temporal scales are those which are close in body size as identified using statistical aggregation identification techniques [@allen_body_1999; Section \@ref(discontAnaly)]. The interactions among species within a single body mass aggregation are presumed to experience a higher frequency and intensity of interspecific interactions with each other as opposed to those in different aggregations [@peterson1998ecological]. Although some species of birds are sexually size dimorphic, I am unaware of any sexually size-dimorphic birds that would likley operate at different spatial and temporal. Therefore,  I constructed body mass distributions of each avian census using the sex-averaged body masses published in @dunning2007crc (available for [download at CRC press](https://www.crcpress.com/CRC-Handbook-of-Avian-Body-Masses/Dunning-Jr/p/book/9781420064445)).
###### Removing select species from censuses
Due to strict reliance on volunteers, some routes are not covered every year. Although NABBS volunteers attempt identify all species in the point-count area,  biases exist in data collection. Rather than retain observations of cryptic or species with low detection rates, I removed sleect species from the censuses (see Methods section in Chapter \@ref(fisherSpatial) for further discussion of this topic). I analyzed species of the following taxonomic families: Accipitriformes, Apodiformes, Cathartiformes, Charadriiformes, Columbiformes, Coraciiformes, Cuculiformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes, Passeriformes and Piciformes. Although removing cryptic, noctornal, and some crepuscular species (e.g. Caprimulgiformes) from the analysis may yield a more conservative body mass distribution, including them may result in correctly identifying additional scaling structures (or body mass aggregations) in some routes but not in others. This method of exlusion also results in a loss of some medium- and larger-bodied Ciconiiformes (Podicipediformes, Phoenicopteriformes, Ciconiiformes; e.g. grebes, pelicans).

#### Species of interest
@allen2006body propose alternative hypotheses for the relative locations of species within the body mass aggregation distributions as a function of 'distance-to-edge', a measure indicating the distance (in log-mass units) of each species to the edge of a body mass aggreagtion (methods described in Section \@ref(discontAnaly)). This distance-to-edge measure is zero when the species falls at the edge of a statistically identifed body mass aggregation. This species is often referred to as an 'edge species'.

To determine the effect of spatial regime shifts on edge species, I identified two types of species of interest: (1) grassland obligates species and (2) species with declinling trends over last 5 decades.
```{r sppIntTab, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
grass <-getTab("grassDeclSppList") %>% filter(id=="grass")
decl <-getTab("grassDeclSppList") %>% filter(id=="declining")
sppIntTab <- getTab("grassDeclSppList") %>% dplyr::select(commonName, id) %>%  
  spread(key="id" , -commonName, fill="")%>%
  rename(`English Common Name`= commonName, 
         `Grassland Obligate` = grass) %>% 
  mutate(
    `English Common Name` = cell_spec(`English Common Name`, "latex", color=ifelse(declining=="declining", "red","black")), 
    `Grassland Obligate` = ifelse(`Grassland Obligate`=="grass", "X","")
    ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(declining), `Grassland Obligate`)
# sppIntTab

kable(sppIntTab %>% dplyr::select(-declining),
      "latex",
      caption="Grassland obligates and species with declining trends (1966-2015) in our study area.",
      booktabs=TRUE) 
```


##### Grassland obligates
The spatial regimes identified in @roberts2019spatial are attributed to large-scale changes in the landscape, including woody plant invasion. The loss of native grassland in our study area due to land conversion is largely attributed to anthropogenic land use change (e.g., development) and fire suppression. Numerous species have been negatively impacted by this widespread habitat loss, but grassland obligates are particularly at risk. I identified `r nrow(grass)` North American grassland obligate species (Table \@ref(tab:sppIntTab)) from the grey literature [@shriver2005distribution; @north2009state] and white literatures [@peterjohn1999population]. Although some grassland obligates were positively impacted by the Conservation Reserve Program [CRP; @peterjohn1999population], this group of birds exhibited strong declines in North America until approximately 2003, the year the Farm Bill was adopted [@north2009state].

Grassland obligates should be strong indicators of the large-scale spatil regime shifts identified in @roberts2019spatial, given their high sensitivity to grassland habitat loss [@herkert1994effects; @].

### Statistical analysis
#### Identifying scaling structure of avian communities using body mass distributions {#discontAnaly}


#### Identifying theMixed modelling to ___xxx___
If the spatial regime shift occurred in the bird community, it should manifest in the local community scaling structure through one or both of species turnover and a shift in the number of body mass aggreagsations. 

## NOTES random
I first identify the discontinuous structure of the bird community before and after woody encroachment occurring at the landscape-scale. Next, I  

on a local bird community  
use the body mass distributions of bird communities in the Central Great Plains before and after a large-scale shift in vegetative structure to 

bird test the Biotic Interaction Hypothesis, which suggests that the biotic interactions within a community operates at the local scale over a relatively short time scale, thus shaping the body mass distribution of the community. 


For example, a recent comparison of body mass distributions in streams of varying quality revelead discontinuous body mass distributions, but no difference in the number of aggregations in the presence of disturbances [@bibi2019body].

@nash2014discontinuities - 

as manifested in animal body masses is well-documented, however, the ecological significance of such discontinuous structure remains unknown. 

The interactions among species in a single aggregation presumably experience a higher frequency and intensity of interspecific interactions with each other as opposed to those in different aggregations (Peterson and others 1998).




- Given the extent and resolution of our data, we are able to only test the biotic interaction and textural discontinuity hypotheses [@allen2006patterns]. 
- I used discontinuity analysis to identify potential scales in the body mass distribution of local avian communities [@barichievy2018method]. 
- "If scale deendent resource variability is introduced into the model, then a single mode can separate into multiple modes (Marquet et al. 1995), indicating an interaction between the distribution of resources in the landscape and body mass aggregations." from allen2006patterns


## Bibliography: grassland birds in NA
@vickery2001recent -- grassland birds experienced widespread declines, in part spurring teh beginning of the NABBS program. BBS trend estiates estimated at least 15 species declinling over the period of 1966-1996,(Peterjohn and Sauer 1999). Compared to other functional grups or species guilds, grassland obligates seemed to have fared worst. These declines are primarily attributed to habitat loss and and degredation.
And it i sno secret that native grasslands are among the most endangered biomes on the planet (Referece). 

The CRP program (beginning in the mid1980s) appears to have benefitted some speies, however. Bobolink, Sedge Wrens, Dickcissels, Le Conte's sparrows, Henslow's sparrows. 

Species not positivley influenced habe been the Grasshopper Sparrow, Easter and Western Meadowlarks (Sauer et al. 1999), despite these species utilizing CRP has habitat and for resources ..... cribbed...(Johnson and
Schwartz 1993, Best et al. 1997).


@brennan2005north -- praire vegetation loss, intensifying agricultural efficiency and practices, lack of fire, adn habitat loss all contribute to the ongoing "crisis" with the loss of grassland and grass-shrub avifauna.
