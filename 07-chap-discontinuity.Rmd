## Introduction
Much of the world's native grassland habitat has been lost in recent deacdes to agricultural and other anthropogenic land use conversion [@]. The conversion of native grassland to row crops which are increasingly subjected to intesified agricultural practices,  have resulted in biodiversity loss which are easily measured by examining long-term changes in bird populations and communities. Native grasslands not converted for agricultural practice or other development are still subject to change due to changes in the feedbacks regulating native grass production, including a loss of wild and prescribed fire and woody plant encroachment [@van2009causes; @twidwell2016plant;@donovan2018social]. Understanding whether these changes manifest in terrestrial communities is an important step towards understanding if, where, and how conservation efforts may be made to protect these areas. 

Animal body mass distributions have been used to identify scaling structures of ecological communities [@allen2006distributions; @allen2002cross; @holling1992cross]. Using statistical methods to identify gaps, or discontinuities, in body mass distributions, some patterns are observed within and across taxonomic groups and biomes. Given the ubiquity of discontinuities identified in body mass distributions of fauna and social systems [@allen2009discontinuities], the ecological signifance of these patterns may prove useful in understanding ecosystem structure and functioning [@angeler2016management]. Various hypotheses are postied as  drivers of the observed discontinuities in animal body mass distributions, including those related to resource use (the Energetic and Textural Discontinuity hypotheses), community interactions, biogeography, and evolution/phylogenetics  [@allen2006discontinuities; @holling1992cross; @blackburn1994animal; @allen2006patterns].

Body size influences the frequency and intensity of inter- and intraspecific competition for resources, territory, and mates, thereby dictating the spatial and temporal scales at which a species of a distinct body size operates [@peters1983effect;@silva1995allometric; @allen2006patterns]. The scaling structure of terrestrial communities are have been found to have 'lumpy' distributions; that is, they are not well-described using paramteric statistical descriptions. If the scaling structure of a community manifests in the body mass distribution of the community, it is  considered reflective of the  discontinuous and heterogeneous nature of resource use. Specifically, @holling1992cross suggests that the body mass distribution of a community or group of species reflects the discontinuous nature of environmental structures and processes. Quantitative analyses of animal body sizes [@allen2006patterns;@nash2014habitat] and other similar distributions has revealed the ubiquity of the discontinuous nature of distributions of animal body masses [@skillen2008ecological; @havlicek2001pelagic], plant biomass [@spanbauer2016body], city population sizes [@garmestani2005time], and animal home range sizes [@restrepo2008discontinuities]. 

A recent study of the Central United States, including and beyond the Great Plains ecoregions, used discontinuity analysis of body mass distributions to identify the locations of what they refer to as 'spatial regimes' over an approximately 50 year period [@roberts2019shifting]. The authors concluded that a spatial regime boundary exists in this region, and has been moving poleward as a consequence of large-scale drivers including woody planty encroachment, fire suppression, and climate change. Using the boundaries identified in this study I seek to determine whether this 'shifting spatial regime' manifests in the grasslands of the Central Great Plains. 

Avian distribution and presence data are abundant, easily accessible and, more importantly, provide insights into resource availability and structure at the local and landscape scales. In this Chapter, I first use discontinuity analysis of avian body mass distributions to identify the scaling structures of local avian communities in the Prairie Potholes, Central Mixed Grass, and Eastern Tall Grass regions of the central Great Plains of North America. I then use these distributions to determine whether the shifting spatial regime proposed by @roberts2019shifting manifests in the grassland bird community which is most susceptible to native grassland habitat loss or degradation [@murray2008relationship]. ALthough I find no evidence to support the hypothesis of the spatial regime boundary suggested in @roberts2019shifting, the results from this study support previous hypotheses that vulnerable species operate at the 'edge' of body mass aggregations. 


## Methods
### Study area
A recent study [@roberts2019shifting] identified what they refer to as spatial regimes across a large portion of the central United States [see Figure \@ref(fig:studyArea)]. Tue authors hypothesize that a spatial regime boundary exists in the Central Great Plains and suggests it has exhibited a Northward shift at a rate of  $\sim\frac{0.05^\circ\ latitude}{year}$. The authors used discontinuity analysis to identify these 'spatial regimes', using the body massess of breeding bird communities. Their hypothesized spatial regime boundary occurs at $39^\circ$ latitude in year 1970, $39.5^\circ$ latitude  in year 1985, $40^\circ$ latitude in year 2000, and $40.5^\circ$ latitude in year 2015 (see Figure \@ref(fig:routesWithSpatRegimes)). Sampling sites were classified each year as belonging to either the Southern or Northern regime according to whether the location was below (Southern) or above (Northern)  the regimes identified by @roberts2019shifting.
```{r studyarea, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="My study area (red box) overlaying the terrestrial Breeding Conservation Regions (BCR) in North America."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("/chapterFiles/discontinuityAnalysis/figsCalledInDiss/mybbox_onBCRmap.jpg"))
```

The study area is designed such that there is minimal crossing of very different BCR, or habitat types (Figure \@ref(fig:studyarea)). In other words, this study area largely falls within BCRs which can be generally classified as grassland habitat (BCR 11, Prairie Potholes; BCR 19, Central Mixed Grass ; BCR 22, Eastern Tall Grass). Using this design we should expect that the functional groups within our avian communities should be similar across BCR boundaries, despite a potential turnover in species identity. Accounting for change in habitat across space allows us to assume that any observed change in the scaling structure of the avian community is due to changes in habitat and resource availability such that similar species are or are not included in the community. 

### Data
#### Avian census data - North American Breeding Bird Survey
I constructed body mass distributions using route-level data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey hereafter [NABBS; @bbsData]. The NABBS uses citizen scientist volunteers to annually collect data using a standardized roadside, single observer, 3-minute point count protocol and has organized data collection annually across North America (Figure \@ref(fig:bbsPoints)) since 1966. Each roadside survey consists of 50, 3-minute point counts (data collected using sight and sound) along  $\sim24.5$ mile stretch of road. Although the point counts are designed to collect estimates of relative abundance, the method for building body mass distributions used in this chapter require only presence absence data. I therefore converted abundances to presence-absence data. I considered a species as 'present' if it was detected on the year in question or the $\pm 1$ year to account for potential false negative observations (i.e., a species was not detected in the NABBS route despite its presence in the local community). 

##### Identifying avian census locations
To determine whether the spatial regime shifts identified in @roberts2019shifting manifested in local avian community structure, I restricted analysis to the grassland habitat of the Central Great Plains. All routes falling within a rectangular area bounded by coordinates $37.8^\circ$ and $44.5^\circ$ latitude, and $-101^\circ$ and $-95.5^\circ$ longitude [see Figure \@ref(fig:routesWithSpatRegimes)]. I retained all NABBS routes which used the sampling protocol '101', which is the standard method for conducting NABBS point count surveys. 

##### Avian body mass data
Species operating at similar spatial and temporal scales are those which are close in body size as identified using statistical aggregation identification techniques [@allen_body_1999; Section \@ref(discontAnaly)]. The interactions among species within a single body mass aggregation are presumed to experience a higher frequency and intensity of interspecific interactions with each other as opposed to those in different aggregations [@peterson1998ecological]. Although some species of birds are sexually size dimorphic, I am unaware of any sexually size-dimorphic birds that would likley operate at different spatial and temporal. Therefore,  I constructed body mass distributions of each avian census using the sex-averaged body masses published in @dunning2007crc (available for [download at CRC press](https://www.crcpress.com/CRC-Handbook-of-Avian-Body-Masses/Dunning-Jr/p/book/9781420064445)).

##### Removing species from analysis
Due to strict reliance on volunteers, some routes are not covered every year. Although NABBS volunteers attempt identify all species in the point-count area,  biases exist in data collection. Rather than retain observations of cryptic or species with low detection rates, I removed sleect species from the censuses (see Methods section in Chapter \@ref(fisherSpatial) for further discussion of this topic). I analyzed species of the following taxonomic families: Accipitriformes, Apodiformes, Cathartiformes, Charadriiformes, Columbiformes, Coraciiformes, Cuculiformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes, Passeriformes and Piciformes. Although removing cryptic, noctornal, and some crepuscular species (e.g. Caprimulgiformes) from the analysis may yield a more conservative body mass distribution, including them may result in correctly identifying additional scaling structures (or body mass aggregations) in some routes but not in others. This method of exlusion also results in a loss of some medium- and larger-bodied Ciconiiformes (Podicipediformes, Phoenicopteriformes, Ciconiiformes; e.g. grebes, pelicans).

##### Taxonomic munging of the census data
Although the NABBS survey reports species-specific abundances, some birds are only classified to genera or order. Common examples of these species are those which are nearly indistinguishable from each other (e.g., Glossy Ibis and White-faced Ibis), birds which are difficult to see under certain conditions (e.g., hummingbirds, fast-moving hawks or accipiters), or speices whose songs are similar. Numerous species were presented as identified to family or genus (e.g., Accipiter sp., Buteo sp., and Trochilids sp.) and others are categorized as hybrid. 

I made decisions regarding species-specific classification based on the North American breeding range maps provided by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Many unidentified species were easily categorized given the lack of overlap in species' ranges in our study area. For example, *Baeolophus bicolor* is nearly indistinguishable from *Baeolophus atricristatus*, however *B. atricristatus* is not known to occur in our study area (Figure \@ref(fig:studyarea))--therefore all accounts classified as either *B. bicolor* or *B. atricristatus* were classified as the former. This example occurred for. Informed decisions like of this nature were made regarding the following unidentified species, where the second name in the binomial was assigned as the species preceding the "/": *Passerina cyanea / amoena*, *Corvus brachyrhynchos / ossifragus*, *Petrochelidon pyrrhonota / fulva*, *Corvus brachyrhynchos*, *Quiscalus major / mexicanus*, *Pipilo maculatus / erythrophthalmus*, *Sturnella magna / neglect*, *Plegadis chihi / falcinellus*, *Coccyzus erythropthalmus / americanus*, *Empidonax traillii / alnorum*, *Icterus galbula / bullockii*, *Nyctanassa nycticorax / violacea*, and *Poecile atricapillus / carolinensis* were all classified according to their known distributions. I classified unidentified hummingbirds (*Trochilid* sp.) as *Selasphorus rufus*,and unidentified Terns (Tern sp.) as *Childonias niger*. All unidentified Accipiters (Accipiter sp.), Buteos (Buteo sp.), and Gulls (Gull sp.) were removed from analysis etirely as there are no clear differences in the probability of occurrence in our study area.

```


#### Identifying species of interest
@allen2006body propose alternative hypotheses for the relative locations of species within the body mass aggregation distributions as a function of 'distance-to-edge', a measure indicating the distance (in log-mass units) of each species to the edge of a body mass aggreagtion (methods described in Section \@ref(discontAnaly)). This distance-to-edge measure is zero when the species falls at the edge of a statistically identifed body mass aggregation. This species is often referred to as an 'edge species'.

To determine the effect of spatial regime shifts on edge species, I identified two types of species of interest: (1) grassland obligates species and (2) species with declinling trends over last 5 decades.
```{r sppIntTab, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
grass <-getTab("grassDeclSppList") %>% filter(id=="grass")
decl <-getTab("grassDeclSppList") %>% filter(id=="declining")
sppIntTab <- getTab("grassDeclSppList") %>% dplyr::select(commonName, id) %>%  
  spread(key="id" , -commonName, fill="")%>%
  rename(`English Common Name`= commonName, 
         `Grassland Obligate` = grass) %>% 
  mutate(
    `English Common Name` = cell_spec(`English Common Name`, "latex", color=ifelse(declining=="declining", "red","black")), 
    `Grassland Obligate` = ifelse(`Grassland Obligate`=="grass", "X","")
    ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(declining), `Grassland Obligate`)
# sppIntTab

kable(sppIntTab %>% dplyr::select(-declining),
      "latex",
      caption="Grassland obligates and species with declining trends (1966-2015) in our study area.",
      booktabs=TRUE) 
```


##### Grassland obligates
The spatial regimes identified in @roberts2019shifting are attributed to large-scale changes in the landscape, including woody plant invasion. The loss of native grassland in our study area due to land conversion is largely attributed to anthropogenic land use change (e.g., development) and fire suppression. Numerous species have been negatively impacted by this widespread habitat loss, but grassland obligates are particularly at risk. I identified `r nrow(grass)` North American grassland obligate species (Table \@ref(tab:sppIntTab)) from the grey literature [@shriver2005distribution; @north2009state] and white literatures [@peterjohn1999population]. Although some grassland obligates were positively impacted by the Conservation Reserve Program [CRP; @peterjohn1999population], this group of birds exhibited strong declines in North America until approximately 2003, the year the Farm Bill was adopted [@north2009state].

Grassland obligates should be strong indicators of the large-scale spatil regime shifts identified in @roberts2019shifting, given their high sensitivity to grassland habitat loss [@herkert1994effects; @].




##### Declinling species

### Statistical analysis
#### Identifying scaling structure of avian communities using body mass distributions {#discontAnaly} 
Discontinuities in body mass distributions been quantified using various methods (e.g., multivariate time series models, regression trees, and gap rarity index)  which are collectively referred to as 'discontinuity analyses' [@nash2014discontinuities; @barichievy2018method; @stow2007evaluating; @allen2009discontinuities]. Using various methods, the discontinuous nature of body masses of ecological communities is well-documented, having been observed in various taxa of both terrestrial [@allen2006patterns] and aquatic [@spanbauer2016body] communities. 



#### Identifying theMixed modelling to ___xxx___
If the spatial regime shift occurred in the bird community, it should manifest in the local community scaling structure through one or both of species turnover and a shift in the number of body mass aggreagsations. 

## NOTES random
I first identify the discontinuous structure of the bird community before and after woody encroachment occurring at the landscape-scale. Next, I  

on a local bird community  
use the body mass distributions of bird communities in the Central Great Plains before and after a large-scale shift in vegetative structure to 

bird test the Biotic Interaction Hypothesis, which suggests that the biotic interactions within a community operates at the local scale over a relatively short time scale, thus shaping the body mass distribution of the community. 


For example, a recent comparison of body mass distributions in streams of varying quality revelead discontinuous body mass distributions, but no difference in the number of aggregations in the presence of disturbances [@bibi2019body].

@nash2014discontinuities - 

as manifested in animal body masses is well-documented, however, the ecological significance of such discontinuous structure remains unknown. 

The interactions among species in a single aggregation presumably experience a higher frequency and intensity of interspecific interactions with each other as opposed to those in different aggregations (Peterson and others 1998).




- Given the extent and resolution of our data, we are able to only test the biotic interaction and textural discontinuity hypotheses [@allen2006patterns]. 
- I used discontinuity analysis to identify potential scales in the body mass distribution of local avian communities [@barichievy2018method].

## Bibliography: grassland birds in NA
@vickery2001recent -- grassland birds experienced widespread declines, in part spurring teh beginning of the NABBS program. BBS trend estiates estimated at least 15 species declinling over the period of 1966-1996,(Peterjohn and Sauer 1999). Compared to other functional grups or species guilds, grassland obligates seemed to have fared worst. These declines are primarily attributed to habitat loss and and degredation.
And it i sno secret that native grasslands are among the most endangered biomes on the planet (Referece). 

The CRP program (beginning in the mid1980s) appears to have benefitted some speies, however. Bobolink, Sedge Wrens, Dickcissels, Le Conte's sparrows, Henslow's sparrows. 

Species not positivley influenced habe been the Grasshopper Sparrow, Easter and Western Meadowlarks (Sauer et al. 1999), despite these species utilizing CRP has habitat and for resources ..... cribbed...(Johnson and
Schwartz 1993, Best et al. 1997).


@brennan2005north -- praire vegetation loss, intensifying agricultural efficiency and practices, lack of fire, adn habitat loss all contribute to the ongoing "crisis" with the loss of grassland and grass-shrub avifauna.

## Discussion

South-North shifts in the past 50 years have been demonstrated in bird population ranges (XXX some ornith. papers), climate zones (??? is this true) and in garden hardening zones (USDA; papers talking about this?). The concept of spatial regimes has recently been introduced as a way to describe this shifting of  dynamics over space-time [@roberts2019shifting; an angeler paper i think did this?; @sundstrom2017detecting].


While identifying discontinuities in body mass aggregations and other systems is ubiquitous, much work is needed to sift through the hypotheses for drivers of these patterns [@allen2006patterns].



### Study limitations

1. Cross-taxa interacitons -- bm dists assumes that the bird comm is not competing for resorueces with otehr taxa...
1. Annual BBS surveys may not represent true census of the area (aggreagting the pres/abs data over multiple years...)
