>*If a regime shift occurs and no one detects it--is it a regime shift at all?*

Anthropogenic activity in the last few decades will continue to influence the interations within and among ecological systems worldwide. The complexity of and drivers of changes in coupled human-natural systems is consequently altered, further limiting our ability to detect and predict change and impacts of change [@liu_complexity_2007; @scheffer_critical_2009]. Early warning systems are developed to detect,  and in some cases predict, abrupt changes in disparate systems [e.g. cyber security [@], infrastructure [@], banking crises [@davis_comparing_2008], and agricultural systems]. The need to develop and improve early warning systems for natural and coupled human-natural systems is exacerbated by the consequences of climate change and globalization, especially when the human-related stakes are high. 

Forecasting change is, arguably, the holy grail of ecology. Paired with an understanding of system interactions, forecasting change is ideal if it provides information with sufficient time to prevent or mitigate unwanted systemic change. 

Despite the quantitative methods proposed as early warning systems for ecological data, they are currently of limited practical utility. This paradox may be a consequence of existing ecological early warning systems (or quantitative methods for identifying systemic change)  having one or more of the  quailities below. Research focusing on these areas will contribute to the advancement and improvement of existing early warning systems, and ideally rule out or highlight those that are or are not useful to practitioners and decision makers. 

  1. not generalizable across systems or system types (especially when it requires a model or a determinsitic function to describe the system) 
  1. require a large number of observations  
  1. difficult to implement   
  1. difficult or to interpret   
  1. requires an understanding of the drivers of change  
  1. performs poorly under uncertainty
  1. give no uncertaintiy around estimates (tying into interpretation issues)  
  1. cannot handle noisy data
  1. ignores or does not sufficiently account for observation error  
  1. no baseline with which to compare results
  1. no application/testing on empirical systems data


The overarching aim of this work is to advance our understanding of the utility and limitations of select early warning systems (a.k.a. regime detection metrics; RDMs). Specifically, herein I focus on RDMs which are designed for or capable of analyzing multi-varaible data, including temporally- and spatially-explicit. Although the most widely-applied RDMs proposed in the ecological literature are those deveoped for and tested on single-variable time series (e.g., temperature or fisheries stock time series), the utility of these methods in multi-variable systems (data) is limited. Regime detection metrics for tracking and identifying changes in multivariable systems data are of greater use than single-variable RDMs in systems within which a change manifests dynamically and across multiple variables (e.g., species). Multivariable RDMs may also prove advantageous when the drivers of systemic change are unknown. Further, ecological systems are noisy, and ecological systems data are messy. 

### Dissertation structure

The chapters hereain are written as separate, publishable manuscripts. Where applicable, co-authors are listed in the front matter of the chapter. The dissertation comprises an introduction to the dissertation (Chapter \@ref(intro-chapter)}), a brief overview of early warning systems (or regime detection measures) for ecological systems data (Chapter \@ref(rdmReview-chapter)), a detailed guide to Fisher Information as a RDM written for ecologists (Chapter \@ref(fiGuide-chapter)), an application of Fisher Information to spatially-explicit data (Chapter \@ref(fisherSpatial-chapter)),  introduction of 'new' RDM, Distance Travelled (Chapter \@ref(distTravelled-chapter)), a study of data quality and data loss on select RDMs including Distance Travelled and Fisher Information (Chapter \@ref(sims-chapter)), and conclusions (Chapter \@ref(conclusions-chapter)).
