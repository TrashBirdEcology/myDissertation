# Introduction {#intro}

Anthropogenic activity in the last few decades will continue to influence the interations within and among ecological systems worldwide. The complexity of and drivers of changes in coupled human-natural systems is consequently altered, further limiting our ability to detect and predict change and impacts of change [@liu_complexity_2007; @scheffer_critical_2009]. Early warning systems are developed to detect,  and in some cases predict, abrupt changes in disparate systems [e.g. cyber security [@!!!!!], infrastructure [@!!!!], banking crises [@davis_comparing_2008], and agricultural systems]. The need to develop and improve early warning systems for natural and coupled human-natural systems is exacerbated by the consequences of climate change and globalization, especially when the human-related stakes are high. 

## Forecasting abrupt changes in ecology
Forecasting undesirable change is, arguably, the holy grail of ecology. Paired with an understanding of system interactions, a forecast is ideal if it provides reliable forecasts with sufficient time to prevent or mitigate unwanted systemic change. Early warning systems (or early warning signals, or early warning indicators) have been developed and tested for some ecological systems data (especially marine fisheries time series and for nutrient loading in shallow lakes). Despite the quantitative methods proposed as early warning systems for ecological data (hereafter referred to as regime detection measures, RDMs), many are currently of limited practical utility. This paradox may be a consequence of existing ecological early warning systems (or other quantitative methods for identifying systemic change)  having one or more of the following characteristics:

  1. not generalizable across systems or system types (especially when it requires a model or a determinsitic function to describe the system) 
  1. require a large number of observations
  1. difficult to implement
  1. difficult or to interpret 
  1. requires an understanding of the drivers of change
  1. performs poorly under uncertainty
  1. give no uncertaintiy around estimates (tying into interpretation issues)
  1. cannot handle noisy data
  1. ignores or does not sufficiently account for observation error
  1. no baseline with which to compare results
  1. no application/testing on empirical systems data
  1. systems are subjectively bounded (i.e., components are chosen)
  1. being overshadowed by semantics
  1. are based on two observations (e.g., before-and-after)
  1. cannot link the shift to potential drivers (i.e. the method reduces the dimensionality such that it is unitless and/or loses all relevant information)

Research focusing on the above areas as they relate to RDMs will contribute to the advancement and improvement of existing early warning systems, and will, hopefully, highlight methods which are useful and which are not to practitioners and decision makers. 

## Dissertation aims
The overarching aim of this dissertation is to advance our understanding of the utility and limitations of select early warning systems. Specifically, I focus on RDMs capable of analyzing multi-varaible data, including temporally- and spatially-explicit. Although the most widely-applied RDMs proposed in the ecological literature are those deveoped for and tested on single-variable time series (e.g., temperature or fisheries stock time series), the utility of these methods in multi-variable systems (data) is limited. Regime detection metrics for tracking and identifying changes in multivariable systems data are of greater use than single-variable RDMs in systems within which a change manifests dynamically and across multiple variables (e.g., species). Multivariable RDMs may also prove advantageous when the drivers of systemic change are unknown. Further, ecological systems are noisy, and ecological systems data are messy. 

Although it's taken us many decades to produce realiable weather forecasts 5 days out (and climate is a low-number system..), ecologists produce regime detection methods with the promise of predicting high-dimensional ecosystem change in advance. Many of these RDMs are not models, like the weather forecasting models which have taken years to refine. 

## Dissertation structure
### Chapter overview
The dissertation comprises a brief introduction (Chapter \@ref(intro)), an overview of the myriad regime detectiob measures used or proposed for use with ecological data (Chapter \@ref(rdmReview)), a detailed guide to Fisher Information as a RDM written for the lay ecologist (Chapter \@ref(fiGuide)), an application of Fisher Information to spatially-explicit data (Chapter \@ref(fisherSpatial)),  introduction of a new regime detection measure, velocity ($v$) (Chapter \@ref(velocity)), a study of data quality and data loss on select regime detectiob measures (Chapter \@ref(resampling)), an application of body mass discontinuity analysis to spatially explicit data (Chapter \@ref(discontinuity)), and a synthesis and conclusions chapter (Chapter \@ref(conclusions)). 


### Accompanying software (appendices)
This dissertation is accompanied by the vignettes for two software I created, which are publicly available for use (MIT use and distribution license). The first is `regimeDetectionMeasures` (Appendix \@ref(regimeDetectionMeasures)), is an R package for calculting multiple regime detection measures, and the second, `bbsRDM` (Appendix \@ref(bbsRDM)), is a package which downloads and uses the North American Breeding Bird Survey data to calculate regime detection measures (using `regimeDetectionMeasures`).
