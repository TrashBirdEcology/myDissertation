# Introduction {#intro-chapter}

## Background  
- On abrupt changes in the environment
1. A few examples of abrupt changes that are highly referenced.   
1. Whydoes it matter that we can detect??
2. A few examples of the methds that have  been used ot identifythese shifts
  - histortically
  - real-time 
  - predictive
3. PRoblems with the methods in 
  - aplpication
    - difficult to apply
    - to interpret
  - theory - lackthereof
4. Descrive the attempts to identify regime shifts

  
## My thesis  
My thesis is that regime detection metrics are not useful and are difficult to interpret and apply to multispecies systems. 
1. Brandolini's principle

TWo major sources of problems?
1. Defining a regime shift  
2. Methods have not proven useful for application beyond single-species systems and systems about which causal drivers can just be monitored.

- Current state of regime shift theory
- Why it is important to diagnose/detect abrupt changes at the system level
- Current methods are not being employed by ecological management. 
    - Why are applications largely restricted to theoretical research?
    - Why are the applications to empirical data largely restricted to the research community?
    - Is this an artefact of how long it takes for applied ecologists and ecological management to adopt new data anlysis techniques?
