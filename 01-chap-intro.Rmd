** IF A REGIME SHIFT OCCURS AND NO ONE DETECTS IT -- IS IT A REGIME SHIFT? **

Anthropogenic activity in the last few decades has drastically influenced the interations within and among Earth systems worldwide. The complexity of and drivers of changes in coupled human-natural systems is consequently altered, further limiting our ability to detect and predict change and impacts of change [@liu_complexity_2007; @scheffer_critical_2009]. 

Early warning systems are developed to detect and predict abrupt changes in disparate systems, e.g. cyber security [@], infrastructure [@], banking crises [@davis_comparing_2008], and agricultural systems [@]. The need to develop and improve early warning systems for natural and coupled human-natural systems is exacerbated by the consequences of climate change and globalization, especially when the human-related stakes are high. 

### Practicality of early warning systems

Forecasting change is arguably the holy grail of ecology. The ability to forecast change, paired with an understanding of system interactions, provides opportunity to prevent or mitigate systemic change. Despite the plethora of regime shift theory and proposed early warning systems in the ecological literatures, early warning systems are currently of limited practical utility. I explain this paradox as a function of early warning systems having the following qualit(ies):

  1. system or context specific; not generalizable  (plus, deterministic functions are often not available for ecological systems) 
  1. require a large number of observations  
  1. difficult implementation  
  1. difficult interpretation  
  1. require an understanding of the drivers of change  
  1. perform poorly under uncertainty  
  1. give no uncertaintiy around estimates  
  1. ignore observation error  
Research in these areas will improve existing and inform future early warning systems, such that they are useful to practitioners and other end-users. In this dissertation I tackle __THE ABOVE NUMBERS LIST HERE__.




### Dissertation aims  

The overarching aim of this work is to advance our understanding of the utility and limitation of using early warning systems (or regime detection metrics). Specifically, I examine those systems/models designed to detect abrupt change in ecological communities. This work is of value to both practitioners and theoreticians: 
  - Chapters are written as separate, publishable manuscripts (*sans* literature cited) geared towards the theoretical and applied ecologist   
  - Case studies, statistical software, and data are provided as reproducible examples of select methodologies.
