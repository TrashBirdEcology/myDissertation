Ecological indicators (a.k.a. indices, metrics) have been suggested as 'early-warning indicators' of ecological regime shifts or abrupt change (Chapters \@ref(intro) and \@ref(rdmReview); \@ref()). Ecological indicators (or indices) are methods of measurement which are designed to provide inference about one or more unobserved or latent processes, are inherently biased. Regardless of the state of the theory supporting *regime shifts* in ecology, ecological indicators and the methods for calculating them should be heavily scrutinized prior to being used in an ecological management or policy-making setting. Rather, new methods (indices, metrics, etc.) are being introduced into the literature at a rate exceeding that at which they are scrutinized (Chapter \@ref(rdmReview)). This dissertation demonstrates that, while potentially useful, regime detection metrics are inconsistent, not generalizable, and are currently not validated using probabilities or other statistical measurements of certainty. 


Regime detection meausres and other ecological indicators can signal (see \@ref(eq:infoTheory)) various changes in the data, however, understanding what processes are embedded in the signals (i.e., removing the noise) requires expert judgement. And because a consequence of data collection and data analysis limits the extent to which we can identify and infer processes and change within an ecological system, **I suggest the practical ecologist scrutinizes her data prior to identifying and conducting analyses**, including those that are purely exploratory. 

Limitations of the findings in this dissertation and of the regime detection methods used herein are largely influenced by the **data collection**, **data munging** processes. Although the below mentioned points may seem logical to many, these assumptions are overlooked by many composite indicators, including regime detection measures. 

  - By collecting and analysing data, the ecologist has defined the bounaries of the system *a priori*. The actual limitations to the system  should be, theoretically, known as a result of bounding the system. Inference beyond this system is extrapolation, and should be treated as speculation, especially when not accompanied by a measure of uncertainty around one's predictions.

  1. Signals in the indicators are restricted to the ecological processes captured by the input data. Extrapolation occurs when processes manifest at scales different than the data collected.  (resolution; Chapter \@ref(fiSpatial))
1. normalization and weighting techniques often impact results (whether ecological or numerical) (Appendices \@ref(bbsRDM) and \@ref(regimeDetectionMeasures))
1. data aggregation techniques often impact results (Chapter \@ref(resampling))
1. some indices fail to generalize across systems or taxa (see Chapters \@ref(intro) and \@ref(rdmMethodsReview))
