   The search boolean for WoS boolean *not* including restriction to fields (WC) 'Ecology' and 'Conservation Biology' yielded over 20,000 results. Restricting to the abovementioned fields created a manageable database from which to filter. This search yielded 2,776 articles. 654 of these papers included terms relating to 'regime shifts' (Figure \@ref(fig:wosRegimePubsByYear)), many appearing in the journal *Ecological Modelling* (Figure \@ref(fig:wosRegimePubsByJrnlmin10Pubs)). The rate of publication of 'regime shift' articles is not strongly correlated with the rate of papers published in 'Ecology' and 'Biodiversity Conservation' fields (Figure \@ref(fig:wosRegimePubsByYearwithNumEcolPubs)).  
  
   ```{r wosRegimePubsByYear, echo=FALSE,  warning=FALSE,  message=FALSE, fig.cap = "Number of publications by year in fields 'Ecology' and 'Biodiversity Conservation' which included terms related to 'regime shift' (total = 654)."} 
   ggplot(wos.regime.plotData) + 
     geom_bar(aes(x = year), stat="count")+ 
     xlab("year")+ylab("# regime shift \nrelevant publications") 
   ``` 
  
   Filtering the Web of Science results by including only articles mentioning terms related to 'new method' yielded 202 articles. After removing prior knowledge, only 93 articles remained to be reviewed 'by hand' (i.e., reading the entire paper). Of those reviewed I identified 2 'new' methods (\@ref(fig:rdmReviewFlow)). Similarly, of the `r 250` articles reviewed from the Google Scholar search, I retained only 3 methods. I was previously aware of an additional 68 articles containing 'new' methods (\@ref(fig:rdmReviewFlow)), approximately half of which were identified using the abovementioned techniques.

     Using my prior knowledge of the relevant literature and by systematically searching the Web of Science and Google Scholar databases, I identified `r nrow(finalMetricsList)` unique regime detection measures (Figure \@ref(fig:rdmReviewFlow); Table \@ref(tab:methodsMetricsListTab1)).

       ### 2. Bibliographic analysis of ecological regime shift literature 
       A search of Web of Science for articles in Ecology and Biodiversity Conservation containing phrases related to 'regime shifts' yielded 1,636 original articles. These articles were not filtered in any fashion and as such all were considered in the bibliographic analysis. 
      
       I used the clustering algorithms of the `bibliometrics` package to produce a  thematic map which uses a clustering algorithm to identify clusters (or themes) based on keywords associated with each article [@cobo2011approach]. Keywords are supplied both by the authors and  by the ISI Web of Science and appear to be used very differently among this literature (Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps_keyword)).  
       The clustering algorithm identified fewer clusters (themes) in the ISI-keywords (Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps_keyword)a) than were identified among the author-supplied keywords (Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps_keyword)b). This is not surprising given the former keywords are restricted to pre-set themes while the authors can often supply any words. The themes identified in the ISI-keyword analysis were relatively consistent as the number of keywords analysed increasded (Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps_keyword_isi)), but the themes varied drastically among the author-supplied keywords (Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps_keyword_author)). For this reason I make inference on only the ISI-supplied keyword cluster analysis. 
      
```{r thematicMaps_keyword, fig.cap="A thematic map of the clusters (themes) identified among the (a) author-supplied and (b) ISI-supplied keywords for each article using a clustering algorithm. Axes represent (x, Callon's centrality) the degree of interaction, or the contribution of the theme to the research field and (y, Callon's density) the strength of the network arcs, or the importance of a theme to the field. Quadrants in each panel (start top-right move counter-clockwise) contain the following clusters: I) motor-themes (important to the field and well-developed); II) basic-themes (well-developed but marginally important to the field); III) emerging and disappearing themes (under-developed and marginal); and IV) specialized themes (important but under-developed). These themes were identified using a clustering algorithm discussed further in @cobo2011approach."} 
       knitr::include_graphics(here::here("chapterFiles/rdmReview/figures/figsCalledInDiss/thematicMaps_keywords.png")) 
  ``` 
      
       Four major themes were identified in the ISI keyword analysis and, interestingly, mostly fell within the two extreme quadrants, the first and the third (Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps_keyword_isi)). The themes identified by ISI keywords were much larger in scope (e.g, dymamics, ecosystems, climate; (Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps_keyword)a) than those identified in the author keywords (e.g., eutrophication, trophic cascade; Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps_keyword)b). Regime shifts and [ecosystem/population] dynamics are usually have both high centrality and density (Figure \@ref(fig:thematicMaps_keyword)b:d), suggesting these two themes are both important to the development of the field and still strongly influence the field. Although dynamics (i.e. non-linearity) plays a central role in the theory of ecological systems this is not reflected in many case studies of regime shifts in application [@litzow_early_2016]. @litzow_early_2016 found that $\sim50%$ of case studies using early warning indicators to identify regime shifts in time series actually tested and/or accounted for non-linear dymamics in the data.   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ```{r thematicMaps_keyword_nvaries, fig.cap="Theme (cluster) identification varies with the number of keywords included in algorithm."}

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A few patterns appear in analyses of the intellectual structure of regime shift research in ecology (Figure \@ref(fig:historiograph)). First, although the concept of stability, thresholds, and multiple stable states in ecological systems first appeared (and was well-receieved) in the literature in the 1970s [e.g., @holling1973resilience; @may1977thresholds], the most important papers in this field appeared primarily in the early and mid 2000s [@scheffer2003catastrophic;@carpenter2006rising;@folke2004regime; @walker2004; @van2005implications]. The most recent major contributions to the field were concpetual works emphasizing planetery boundaries and tiping points and the impacts of not recognizing these shifts [@hughes2013living;@hughes2013multiscale]. Finally, the "rise" of resilience theory [@folke2004regime; @walker2004], the first efforts of a search for early warning indicators of ecological regime shifts [@carpenter2006rising] and a spur of critique of regime shift detection methods [@andersen_ecological_2009;@contamin_indicators_2009] are recognized in the historiograph.

Arguably equally as influential include the papers corresponding to the observed rapid increase in the number of publications (in the early 2000s), @folke2004regime and @scheffer2003catastrophic (Fig \@ref(fig:totArtCitesPerYear)).

Further, comprehensive reviews of the ecological regime shift detetion literautre are increasingly out-dated. A permanent and open-source database containing information critical to the testing, comparison, and implementation of RDMs may prove useful to the reader who is interested in applying RDMs but is lacking the statistical or mathematical background to do so.

However, many of these works apply the traditional (and other) early warning indicators to simulated data, with only some [@contamin_indicators_2009;@perretti2012regime;@dutta2018robustness;@dakos2012robustness] testing under varying conditions of noise and expected shift types. The utility and robustness of the traditional early warning indicators is not consistent across and within sytems, making them of limited utility in situations where the system cannot be reliably mathematically modelled, or where we have limited data [see also Ch. \@ref(resampling)]. The authors of most reviews and comparative studies of early warning indicators suggest that no early warning indicator is reliable alone, or that work is needed to understand under what empirical conditions early warning indicators might fail [@kefi2014early; @clements2018indicators;  @filatova2016regime; @deyoung_regime_2008].
