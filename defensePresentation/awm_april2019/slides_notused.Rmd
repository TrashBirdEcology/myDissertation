- Globalization is leading to large-scale and long-lasting changes, including
    - climate change
    - urbanization
- And is creating novel ecosystemsThe consequences of globalization -- climate change, urbanization, habitat loss, etc.-- are expected to pave the way for novel ecosystems.

# Types of Regime Shifts  <!-- type plots -->


Given a system state $S$, and a driver, $D$, we can imagine a many potrential scenarios to evolve given shifts in $D$. 


[Dakos et al. 2014]


```{r rsTypesPlot}
# slow driver to tipping point
x = 1:10
  a =-1
  b = 4
  c = 10
S  = a*x^2 + b*x + c
D = mean(S)

p1<-myPlot(x = x, y1=S, y2=D, hline = D)+ 
  geom_line(aes(x = max(x):(max(x)+round(length(x)*.4)), # add flat line to end  
                y = min(S)), size = 1)+
  ggtitle("slow driver to tipping point")
# 
x = c(1:5, 5:10)
  a =  rep(10, 5)
  b =  c(rep(2, round(length(x)*.5,0)))
S = c(a,b)
D = mean(S)      

p2<-myPlot(x = x, y1=S, y2=D, hline = D)+
    ggtitle("slow driver to tipping point")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow=2)
```

Panel 1: slow driver to a tipping point
Panel 2:
Panel 3: 

<!-- Characteristics  -->
<!-- 1. at least two 'stable' states, stable of ecologically relevant time scale -->
<!-- 2. states are reinforce through some negative feedback -->
<!-- 3.  -->
